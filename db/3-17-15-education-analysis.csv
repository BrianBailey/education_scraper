2002,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Kennerly Elementary School, in St. Louis, MO. Kennerly is one of nine schools to be named recently to the 2000 National Schools of Character in recognition of its exemplary work to encourage the social, ethical and academic development of its students through character education.Sponsored by the Character Education Partnership, National Schools of Character is an annual awards program recognizing K-12 schools and districts demonstrating outstanding character education initiatives and yielding positive results in student behavior, school environment, and academic performance. Kennerly exemplifies its school motto ``Friends Learning Together'' by involving students, teachers, parents, and the community. Included in Kennerly's character education programs are a Character Plus Team, a Character Club, and a Character Cabinet.As a strong supporter of character education, I am pleased to see that Kennerly's Character Education program has produced great results, both in academics, and in the social climate of the school. Academic performance has increased, and discipline problems have decreased. I have fought to increase the amount of funding available for character education because schools like Kennerly have demonstrated that character education programs increase the value of education for all our children and enhance our communities. It is truly a privilege for students to attend schools like Kennerly.So, I extend my congratulations to Kennerly Elementary School in St. Louis, Missouri, for its outstanding character education programs. ,2015-03-17 19:08:42.989449,2015-03-17 19:08:42.989449,Senate,TRIBUTE TO KENNERLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,2000-10-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-30/html/CREC-2000-10-30-pt1-PgS11368-4.htm,140,0,146,S11368,A000356,mr. ashcroft

2007,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the Missouri State Senate and Missouri House of Representatives in support of home education. The Missouri General Assembly has designated the first week of May as Home Education Week. Missouri is looked to as a leader nationwide in home education movement.Home education in Missouri has enjoyed considerable success in recent years because of the tremendous support received from countless citizens who realize the significance of family participation in the education process. Home education allows parents to ensure that the positive character traits and moral values instilled in their children at home are reinforced by the educational process.Home education is successful and history proves it. Since the founding of America many famous Americans have been home educated. That list includes George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Booker T. Washington, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mark Twain and Sandra Day O'Conner. Home education is practiced by over 4,600 citizens of Missouri.Without hesitation, I thank each parent who is at home teaching their child the skills they will need to succeed in the competitive world we live in today. I hope that my colleagues will join me today to let you know that your efforts are generally appreciated.,2015-03-17 19:08:43.814035,2015-03-17 19:08:43.814035,Extensions,HOME EDUCATION,1999-04-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-14/html/CREC-1999-04-14-pt1-PgE636-4.htm,51,0,145,E636,B000575,mr. blunt
2008,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Obey education and training amendment and in opposition to H.R. 3755, the fiscal year 1997 Labor-Education-HHS appropriations bill.Mr. Chairman, Republican appropriators boast that their budget preserves meaningful Federal support for education. Unfortunately, their behavior does not coincide with their rhetorical bragging.The appropriations bill before us today does not preserve our commitment to the children of this country. It shortchanges basic education and assistance to the most vulnerable student populations, withdraws support for State and local education reform, sabotages school improvement efforts, and denies opportunities for low-income students to pursue higher education as a reasonable goal.Republicans attempt to package their fiscal year 1997 education budget as a freeze. But characterizing this atrocity as a budgetary freeze is like calling a termite an interior decorator. In reality, the bill represents a continued erosion of Federal support for education. The simple fact is this bill cuts education funding, and these cuts come on top of last year's $1.1 billion reduction in education dollars. Unfortunately, the Republican 6-year balanced budget calls for a continued downward slide in Federal education support.I fail to see the logic of curtailing support for education, particularly in light of the increasing demands on our education system. School enrollments are rising to record-high levels. In the next 6 years, the period covered by the Republican budget plan, public elementary and secondary school enrollments are projected to increase by 7 percent, and college enrollment by 12 percent. Given these soaring increases in the student population, ever-increasing service costs, and shrinking local education budgets, these cuts will have disastrous results for our children.It makes no sense to balance the budget by sacrificing investments in the young people who will assume awesome responsibility of leading the world. Investing in education yields extraordinary benefits in terms of increased productivity and economic growth. Equal access to education and educational excellence for all of our children require vigorous and responsible leadership. The bill before us today takes this country in the wrong direction.Mr. Chairman, on the other hand, I support the amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Obey. His amendment would restore funds to assist 8,500 schools in improving the academic achievement of their students, provide basic education assistance for an additional 450,000 children from low-income communities, preserve professional development opportunities for 750,000 teachers and educators, and restore opportunities for 96,000 low-income students to receive Perkins grants to pursue higher education.Finally, the bill's funding of training programs is woefully inadequate. In this era of increased global competition, we must rely more than ever on our Nation's most valuable resource: The skills and productivity of our workers. A strong training system is critical to our future. Regrettably, the Republican Congress continues to ignore this reality.The Republican Congress cut over $3 billion from education and training in the 1995 rescission bill and the 1996 omnibus appropriations bill. Today we consider a bill that cuts further at training programs. The Republican bill would deny training opportunities to thousands of dislocated workers who seek retraining to improve their skills, and remain productive citizens. Job losses are inevitable in today's fast-paced economy, as corporate downsizing continues at an alarming rate. The faster dislocated workers can move into new jobs, the better it is for them, their families, and for the American economy. We cannot turn our backs on workers in need of retraining.I urge my colleagues to reject the Republican approach to education and training. I urge Members to honor our commitment to students and workers by voting for the Obey amendment.,2015-03-17 19:08:43.958167,2015-03-17 19:08:43.958167,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997,1996-07-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-11/html/CREC-1996-07-11-pt1-PgH7280-2.htm,102,253,142,H7280-H7327,C000488,mr. clay
2009,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, H.R. 584 designates the Department of Education Building as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building. Lyndon Baines Johnson was born in Stonewall, Texas, on August 27, 1908, and his connection to education began very early in life when at the age of 4 his mother persuaded the teacher at the nearby one-room junction school to take him as a student.Lyndon Baines Johnson enrolled in the Southwest Texas State Teachers College in 1927. He graduated in 1930 and embarked on a teaching career that would eventually lead him to the White House. As was pointed out by the gentlelady, in 1937 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election.He was subsequently re-elected to the House in each succeeding Congress until 1948 when he was elected to the United States Senate. In 1961, he resigned from the Senate to become the 37th Vice President; and on November 22, 1963, a day we all remember, Lyndon Baines Johnson became the 36th President of the United States.This teacher who would become President pursued numerous education initiatives, as was pointed out. He signed into law education legislation such as the Higher Education Facilities Act, the Library Services Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Higher Education Act, just to name a few.After leaving office, President Johnson continued to have an impact on education, as he taught students while he was writing his memoirs, and subsequently passed away on January 22, 1973.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:44.116251,2015-03-17 19:08:44.116251,House,LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUILDING,2007-03-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-03-06/html/CREC-2007-03-06-pt1-PgH2182.htm,38,7,153,H2182-H2190,G000546,mr. graves
2010,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 90 seconds.Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the other side for waiting until at least the second speaker to bring up the mantra ``tax breaks for the wealthy.'' What I would like to do is refute that comment specifically from the last speaker.As this body knows, we have yet to reach the appropriation for public education. The Labor, Health, Education appropriations bill is yet to come. That is the funding mechanism for public schools.I would take issue with my friend from Washington State who declared that somehow there are cuts in public education. Since 1995, this body has increased funding for public education by nearly 30 percent, and I dare say I question how additional funds in public education is perceived to be a cut.Specifically, to the point raised by the last speaker, 70 percent of the tax savings just from education savings accounts go to families with children in public schools making less than $75,000 a year. Let me repeat that statement: 70 percent of the benefits of education savings accounts go to public school children whose parents make a combined income of less than $75,000. There are 14 million families whose children benefit from just the education savings account vehicle. Almost 11 million of those are children who attend public schools.So I think that clearly the issue of funding of public education is something this body will consider later in the appropriations process, and I certainly take issue with the comments of the last speaker.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:44.291381,2015-03-17 19:08:44.291381,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE PERMANENCE ACT OF 2002,2002-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-04/html/CREC-2002-09-04-pt1-PgH6022.htm,110,15,148,H6022-H6028,H000948,mr. hulshof
2011,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, in light of the $3.5 billion increase just given to education in the omnibus spending bill, I rise today to underscore yet again the crucial role that our Federal education programs play. This apparent sudden concern on the part of my Republican colleagues for protecting education is gladly received, because millions of young Americans will benefit from these resources.During the 104th Congress, the Democratic members of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, however, were distressed by the repeated attempts by the majority to slash funds for education. In fact, earlier this year, we held a hearing to demonstrate the impact that Federal education programs have on preparing America's children for a bright future. At this hearing, we heard many witnesses testify in trenchant detail about the pain that defenseless children, students, and families were suffering from the cuts Congress had imposed on Federal education programs. The higher education student community was represented at this hearing by two outstanding students, Rob Sewell and Willie Brown, then the president and vice-president, respectively, of the American Student Association of Community Colleges. I would like to insert their testimony into the Record at this time, because it perfectly illustrates from a student's point of view why Democrats will always fight for education. After all, education is the true path to opportunity, and our role as legislators should be to increase access to lifelong learning for all Americans. This is the only way that our country will become stronger and more productive into the 21st century.of the American Student Association of Community Colleges,2015-03-17 19:08:44.506534,2015-03-17 19:08:44.506534,Extensions,THE IMPORTANCE OF FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION,1996-10-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-10-03/html/CREC-1996-10-03-pt1-PgE1913-4.htm,141,0,142,E1913-E1914,C000488,mr. clay
2012,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Did you know there was a report that was done on the Department of Education? I think it was during the days of Ronald Reagan. Their conclusion in the report was that if a foreign country had done to America what the Department of Education had done to education, we would consider it an act of war. I thought that was kind of an interesting report that we're paying money for a department that has done what would be considered an act of war.,2015-03-17 19:08:44.686656,2015-03-17 19:08:44.686656,House,POLITICAL DRAMA AT THE WHITE HOUSE,2010-02-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-24/html/CREC-2010-02-24-pt1-PgH817-2.htm,24,35,156,H817-H823,A000358,mr. akin
2013,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,If the gentlewoman will yield on that point, not just businesses and corporations but not-for-profits would also be allowed under this expanded savings account to provide a contribution as you have suggested, perhaps for that low-income child. It could be a church who might establish on behalf of a parishioner an expanded education savings account to really provide an incentive for that child to continue to go on.One of the arguments that I hear and probably that we will hear more over the course of the debate on this bill is that allowing, and again we are talking about the interest buildup or the earnings, first of all these are after-tax dollars going into an education savings account and then the power of compound interest being used to create additional earnings, we are talking about allowing those earnings to accumulate tax-free if used for a qualified education expense.Now, one of the arguments against elementary and secondary education expenses is that only the affluent, or we are taking money away from public education. I think as my friend from New Mexico has the chart right next to her, it speaks volumes. The reductions that we would see in Federal education spending would be zero. No money would be diverted away from public education.In fact, the official scorekeeper that we work under, the Congressional Budget Office along with the Committee on Joint Taxation, says that we will have additional resources committed to the education of our kids coming from the private sector, that is, coming from families that we do not see now. In fact, they tell us some of these numbers. Fourteen million families would benefit from this expanded savings account, and about 11 million of those families have kids going to public school. So, in other words, we are committing even additional resources from the private sector, from the families for education expenses at the elementary and secondary education level.The other point I would make, current law restricts education savings accounts to be used just for public college, obviously a worthy goal, higher education, but that means education savings accounts are useless in addressing problems that are being experienced in elementary school or in high school. And so while you may try to get to college, it might be that if we could have parents working with teachers as allies in the lower grades, then children will be more prepared to enter college. So I think it is a little bit of a myth as far as the argument on the other side that somehow we are taking money out of the Federal education system. Just the contrary. We are committing more private funds, that is, private savings funds committed to the education of our kids, both primarily in public education and yes, perhaps private education or even home schooling. The idea is simple. We do not think any child should be discriminated against based on where he or she chooses to attend school.,2015-03-17 19:08:44.869793,2015-03-17 19:08:44.869793,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,2000-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-28/html/CREC-2000-03-28-pt1-PgH1455-4.htm,36,4,146,H1455-H1461,H000948,mr. hulshof
2014,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, when I talk with parents, teachers principals and school administrators throughout Southern Missouri, it becomes very clear that much needs to be done to strengthen our local school systems. Aging facilities, increasing class sizes, and tight funding are placing a tremendous strain on the quality of education available for our children. And no two school districts are alike in their specific needs. Whether it's building new classrooms, repairing a hole in the gymnasium roof, hiring more teachers, or acquiring new computers or test books, only the parents, educators, and locally elected school boards really know what priorities need to be met in their schools.There is no question that our local school districts are faced with significant challenges in preparing our children for the future. Unfortunately, our current federal education programs falling well short in assisting our communities to succeed. One of the problems is that 35 percent of federal education funds are spent on meeting the operation budgets of the more than 760 federal education programs spread out between 39 different agencies. This means that only 65 cents of each education dollar is actually making it to our classrooms. This diversion of funds is particularly burdensome on rural communities. Southern Missouri's school districts are limited in local funding options and we simply need more of our federal education dollars returned to us.Another significant problem is the burdensome federal regulations and mandates that tie schools' hands and cut into educators' valuable teaching time. According to Vice President Gore's National Performance Review, if a local school district decides to apply for a Department of Education grant, the entire process takes 26 weeks and 487 steps from beginning to end. That's 6 months and countless hours spent on applying for a grant--all without any guarantee that the funds will be approved. I have heard from teachers in Southern Missouri who personally spend up to three days out of the week writing grants and filing out paperwork. This is time that our teachers--who are already overloaded with large classes and limited resources--could be dedicating to planning lessons, teaching their classes, and reviewing student's work. It seems to me that our education system needs fewer bureaucrats in Washington crunching numbers and dreaming up federal mandates and more teachers in our local schools educating our children.I introduced legislation that begins to address the problems of funding and over regulation in our nation's education policy. My legislation--known as the: ``District Check for Education Act,'' or simply ``Direct Check''--would consolidate several Department of Education competitive grant programs and return federal education dollars directly to the local school or school district based on the number of students served. ``Direct Check'' funds are not tied to any burdensome federal regulations or mandates, and they can be used for purchasing text books, computers and technology, teachers' salaries, and classroom construction or renovation. Other allowable uses of these funds include literacy programs, job training initiatives, and drug and alcohol programs.Education is a national priority, but it is a local responsibility. It has always been carried out and implemented at the local level. The bottom line is that no Department of Education bureaucrat who lives and works in the city of Washington, DC or its suburbs can possibly understand the educational needs of our children in rural Southern Missouri. My ``Direct Check'' bill empowers local school districts by giving them the control and flexibility to use federal education dollars in a way that best meets their priorities for improving the education system for their children. And by freeing up resources and giving them directly to local school districts, we can help preserve and strengthen our American public education tradition as we head into the 21st Century.,2015-03-17 19:08:45.013889,2015-03-17 19:08:45.013889,Extensions,DIRECT CHECK FOR EDUCATION ACT,1999-03-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-17/html/CREC-1999-03-17-pt1-PgE459-3.htm,42,0,145,E459,E000172,mrs. emerson

2025,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to voice my support along with the Missouri State Senate and the Missouri House of Representatives for home education. The Missouri General Assembly has designated the second week of May as Home Education Week. Missouri has been recognized as a leader nationwide in the home education movement. Home Education Week is a good way to acknowledge those parents in Missouri who have helped to establish a strong foundation for quality home education.Home education has always been unique because it provides the opportunity for children to be taught by their parents or someone the parents trust. Home educators are able to meet the individual needs of their children by designing educational lessons for each child. They also provide children in home education numerous opportunities to learn through hands-on activities, where they are able to apply what they are learning in real-life settings. The one-on-one interpersonal ties that are developed in home education between a parent and their children establish solid mentoring relationships.I know of many families in the Seventh District of Missouri that I represent who educate their children through more than just their textbooks. They regularly take field trips and conduct science experiments so that they can apply what they are learning. I know one family who has entered award-winning projects in the Ozark Empire Fair in science and drawing competitions as well as winning awards regionally and statewide in speech contests. The Will Purvis family is one of many southwest Missouri families who are making a visible difference in the education their children through home education.I want to thank each parent who has made the decision to educate their children at home. This decision requires a great amount of dedication. This dedication requires planning and preparation that involves many extra hours and late nights of preparation. Their dedication results pay off in home-educated students that do well when they compete with their peers nationwide in private and public schools and in higher education. We should continue to support their dedication as they continue to make a visible difference.,2015-03-17 19:08:46.747127,2015-03-17 19:08:46.747127,Extensions,HOME EDUCATION WEEK,1997-04-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-24/html/CREC-1997-04-24-pt1-PgE749.htm,50,0,143,E749,B000575,mr. blunt
2026,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and distinguished career in the field of education is coming to an end. Dr. Jack L. Howard, of Lebanon, MO, will retire his position as Superintendent of the Lebanon School District on May 30, 2003.Dr. Howard graduated from Southwest Missouri State College in 1966 with a Bachelor of Science in Education degree. In 1972, he earned his Master of Science in Education from Southwest Missouri State College and his Education Specialist degree from Central Missouri State University. Dr. Howard earned his Educational Doctorate in December 1982 from the University of Missouri, Columbia.Dr. Howard has had an exceptional career in education for many years. In 1966, Dr. Howard started his educational career at Macks Creek High School as a teacher of Biology, Social Studies, and Physical Education. In August, 1968, he became Macks Creek High School Principal. From 1969-1971, Dr. Howard left the public schools for a position as Personnel Specialist for the United States Army. He returned to the public school sector in 1972 as the Superintendent of Hermitage Public School. In 1974, he became Dallas County Schools' Assistant Superintendent and was promoted to Superintendent in 1976. He served there until 1984, when he became the Superintendent for Marshfield Reorganized School District. From July 1993 until the present, he has served as Superintendent of Lebanon R-3 Schools.In addition to his dedication to education, Dr. Howard is a member of Lebanon First Baptist Church and the Lebanon Rotary Club. He also is a member of the Southwest Missouri Administrators Association, the Missouri Association of School Administrators, and the American Association of School Administrators.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Howard has served the field of education for over 37 years. As he prepares for the next stage in his life, I am certain that my colleagues will join me in wishing him all the best.,2015-03-17 19:08:46.903232,2015-03-17 19:08:46.903232,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DR.

2027,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to supported H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. It represents a significant step forward in increasing our Federal investment in higher education.Both the House and Senate have worked for over over a year to fashion legislation that I believe strengthens our country's commitment to higher education. When this bill is enacted, it will make a college education more affordable by significantly reducing student loan interest rates, by increasing Pell grant award levels, and improving the calculation of benefits for independent and dependent students.The bill adopts a number of measures that enhance support for minority and disadvantaged students by strengthening the TRIO program and other programs supporting historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges, and institutions serving significant numbers of native Alaskan and Hawaiian students.This bill includes the High Hopes Program of President Clinton and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah). This new program will greatly enhance the opportunity for low-income middle-school-aged students to dream of a college education.The bill also creates a major new effort to recruit and train teachers for our Nation's public schools. The new grant program provides for partnerships between States, institutions of higher education and local school districts, designed to increase the number of certified teachers available and to improve upon how those teachers are trained. Also included in that initiative is a loan forgiveness provision designed to attract the best and brightest to our classrooms. This bill will also allow the Department of Education to strengthen and improve the way it administers all of the student financial aid.Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the conference report on the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:47.048335,2015-03-17 19:08:47.048335,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6, HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998,1998-09-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-09-28/html/CREC-1998-09-28-pt1-PgH9151-2.htm,132,4,144,H9151-H9162,C000488,mr. clay
2028,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Each year the Perkins Act helps over 10 million vocational students receive high-quality education, to receive jobs and skill training and to receive support services. That is our country's flagship vocational education program. We have worked with our Republican colleagues for several months to resolve differences concerning reauthorization of this act and have reached a fair compromise in the way States distribute vocational education funds to the local educational agencies.So, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] and the gentleman from California [Mr. Martinez] and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling], the chairman, for resolving these difficult issues.The bill as reported by the committee would have resulted in a significant reduction in funding for existing vocational education programs in urban and rural areas. The bipartisan agreement reached on the formula that will be offered later by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] preserves formula allocations for existing vocational education programs for the first 3 years, and it provides for the gradual implementation of a formula based 60 percent on poverty and 40 percent on population.Although some of us would have preferred maintaining the existing Perkins Act formula for all 5 years of reauthorization, this, however, is a fair, good faith compromise that will ensure the continuation of all local programs.Mr. Chairman, the bill also strengthens the integration of academics and vocational education to ensure that vocational education programs are academically challenging.Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill needs additional improvement with regard to women, especially for displaced homemakers and those entering nontraditional employment. Later this morning, the gentlewoman from Hawaii [Mrs. Mink] will offer amendments which are designed to achieve gender equity in vocational education, and despite what was said, it is needed, Mr. Chairman.I hope that our colleagues will support this amendment and support the reauthorization bill.,2015-03-17 19:08:47.204446,2015-03-17 19:08:47.204446,House,CARL D.

2029,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support House Resolution 139, the dollars to the classroom resolution. I commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Pitts], the sponsor; the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the Committee on Education and the Workforce for their continual hard work to ensure that real reform occurs in our Nation's education system.Mr. Speaker, this resolution would simply set a goal that at least 90 percent of Federal elementary and secondary education dollars reach the classroom. It is currently estimated that only 65 percent of all Federal funds actually reach our Nation's classrooms. This town is notorious for talking about reforming this education system, but this dismal statistic proves that nothing has been accomplished.The dollars to the classroom resolution is a great way to send a message to the administration that we in Congress are prepared to invoke real reform at the Department of Education. Our goal should be an education system where every child can outscore, outperform and outcompete the students of every other Nation in the world. It is time to put our children before bureaucrats. The decision of how our education money is spent needs to be made by local teachers, local administrators and parents, not the Federal Government. It is time that we invest more wisely, and we must spend our education dollars where they can achieve the most, right in the classroom.This resolution would mean as much as $1,800 would be added to each classroom budget. At Houston Middle School in southern Missouri, where I taught a class last week, $1,800 is the difference between having computers and much newer books and other much needed learning resources in that classroom. They desperately need it. It is finally time for Congress to take a stand and do what is right for our Nation's children. I urge my colleagues to support the dollars to the classroom resolution.,2015-03-17 19:08:47.358556,2015-03-17 19:08:47.358556,House,SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING DOLLARS TO THE CLASSROOM,1997-10-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-10-28/html/CREC-1997-10-28-pt1-PgH9567-7.htm,147,59,143,H9567-H9575,E000172,mrs. emerson
2030,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment because it is unconstitutional, runs counter to our Nation's commitment to the value of education, and is morally repugnant.First, it violates the equal protection clause by granting States the option of denying undocumented children the same rights to a public education extended to other children residing in their States history documents the idiocy of challenging the constitutional and moral right of children to a free public education?Second, 2 years ago, when the Congress reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act, we inserted the following statement of principle into that law:That a high-quality education for all individuals and a fair and equitable opportunity to obtain that education are a societal good, are a moral imperative, and improve the life of every individual, because the quality of our individual lives ultimately depends on the quality of the lives of others.We did not qualify that principled position. We did not say that it applied to some children, and not to others; we did not say that it did not apply to undocumented children. We applied that statement to all individuals.Finally, Mr. Chairman there is no moral currency in denying undocumented children an education. We have no right to use education as a tool to enforce our immigration laws. All we will succeed in doing is punishing innocent children for the transgressions of their parents. We have no right to impose responsibility for enforcement of our immigration laws on our schools. All we will succeed in doing is turning our teachers into de facto INS agents. We have to no right to point fingers at children and block their entrance to the schoolhouse. All we will succeed in doing is stigmatizing children and encouraging negative behavior.In defense of our Constitution and our values, and for the sake of humanity and compassion, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gallegly amendment.,2015-03-17 19:08:47.514673,2015-03-17 19:08:47.514673,House,IMMIGRATION IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST ACT OF 1995,1996-03-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-20/html/CREC-1996-03-20-pt1-PgH2475.htm,39,118,142,H2475-H2505,C000488,mr. clay

He worked to implement borrower benefit programs including loan forgiveness and low interest rates. I admire his tenacity and determination in that he played a key role in supporting and organizing student aid programs in which thousands of Missourians benefit.On October 14th, we lost a great education pioneer.

I have always recognized the importance of family involvement in the education of our youth and applaud the efforts of home educators to make a difference in the lives of their families.In today's complex society it is especially significant to have guidance in the development of our children and their continuing education. Through adult mentors, home schoolers develop, not only a close relationship with their families, but also acquire the much needed interpersonal skills through involvement in civic and community organizations in form of apprenticeship opportunities.The support home schooling receives helps to cultivate its success through family participation in our communities. My home State of Missouri especially relishes the high quality of home education and the strong family values it teaches. I commend the energies of FHE and the families that help make it possible. I wish FHE continued success and growth in future years. ,2015-03-17 19:08:48.126108,2015-03-17 19:08:48.126108,Senate,RECOGNITION OF FAMILIES FOR HOME EDUCATION,1998-05-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-05/html/CREC-1998-05-05-pt1-PgS4372-3.htm,54,0,144,S4372-S4373,B000611,mr. bond

2036,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, as a parent and former teacher, it is a privilege for me to be able to recognize Missouri home schoolers, who will observe Missouri Home Education Week during May 2-8, 1999.Home schooling has been legal in Missouri since the state's founding in 1821. Since that time, and especially in the last two decades, home schoolers have faced numerous challenges and successes.Fortunately, legislators are increasingly recognizant of the importance of local decision-making and parental involvement in our children's education. Home Education Week reminds us that parents are the first and best educators of their children. Study after study has shown that parental involvement is the most important factor in a child's academic achievement.It is, therefore, appropriate that we celebrate Home Education Week by acknowledging the hard work, dedication, and commitment to academic excellence of the more than 4,300 home school families in my home state. Recently, the Washington Post lauded the academic achievement of these families. The Post article describes a study of home-schooled children, stating that they ``score well above the national median on standardized tests [and] often study above their normal grade level.''It was an honor for me to proclaim Missouri's first Home Education Week in 1989. Now, in 1999, I look forward to the continued success of Missouri home school families, and to working with them to promote the kind of freedom that encourages parents to take an active role in guiding the course of their children's education.,2015-03-17 19:08:48.425318,2015-03-17 19:08:48.425318,Senate,CELEBRATING MISSOURI HOME EDUCATION WEEK,1999-04-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-27/html/CREC-1999-04-27-pt1-PgS4247-4.htm,58,0,145,S4247,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2037,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding leaders dedicated to the education of our youth in southwest Missouri. At a time when many school systems are struggling to provide a quality education, these civil servants have settled for nothing less than excellence in preparing our students in southwest Missouri for the future.The Missouri School Boards' Association has selected the Nixa R-II Board of Education as the State of Missouri's Outstanding Board of Education for 2004. This decision was made by a committee of school board members from among 524 districts. It is the second time that Nixa's school board has received this honor, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to education in our community.The Nixa School Board, chaired by Peggy Taylor, has successfully lobbied local, state, and federal officials for continuing support of educational goals. Their leadership contributed to the lives of Nixa students in five general areas of significance: school district accreditation, community engagement, improved student achievement, success with school district goals and local board initiatives. Through their dedication and relentless pursuit of the goals placed before them, this school board has called attention to the strength of the education system in the Seventh Congressional District of Missouri.Additionally, the school board has built overall trust and encouraged effective communication between the Nixa RII School Administration and the community. The District Superintendent, Steven Kleinsmith, attributes much of the school district's success to the high expectation that the Board of Education placed on itself and sought from others. Success, such as a perfect score on Missouri's Annual Performance Review conducted by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and earning the State of Missouri's highest accreditation possible, ``Accredited with Distinction for Performance,'' demonstrate a demand for superior education and represents the quality of our public schools in southwest Missouri.Today is a great day for the city of Nixa, the Nixa RII School System, and its Board of Education.

2038,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, I rise today to support President Bush's education initiative and S. 1, the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act. As a new member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee I have been involved in the tremendous bipartisan progress that has been made in Congress thus far on public education reform. I look forward to the swift conclusion of the debate, the signing ceremony that will take place, but most importantly--the improvements to public education that will result to ensure that ``no child is left behind.''It is obvious that the American public places improvement of our public education system as a top priority. Parents and communities are aware of the same statistics that have been provided to us. Our children are not reading at the basic level. Too many students never graduate from high school. U.S. students lag behind too many countries in science and math. Our higher education institutions are spending too much money on remedial education and businesses have to spend billions of dollars teaching their employees what the schools did not teach them.I believe there is agreement that education, while a national priority, is a responsibility and obligation of the state and local communities. The education of our children has always been carried out and implemented at the local level. The American public is interested in the debate here in Washington, but they understand what really matters is what takes place in the schools and classrooms around the country--not the Senate or House floors.The decisions that are going to improve children in a particular school district are going to be made by the teachers, parents, school board members, and administrators who know the names of the children, know their problems, know their opportunities.Every single one of us have a vested interest in the success of today's generation and future generations of youth in this country. Therefore, we have a vested interest in the improvement of our public education system.For many decades Congress has debated numerous education issues, including the federal role and federal funding. Even after the completion of this specific debate, discussions and debates will continue. The debates continue because we are constantly seeking ways to improve upon our public education system.However, we must be careful. One of the main reasons that I support President Bush's plan and S. 1 is because it streamlines and consolidates many of the countless individual education programs that exist. We have all read the reports and have heard several colleagues talk about the 760 education programs scattered throughout 39 different federal agencies. According to the Education Commission of the States, ``In the 1999-2000 budget, the federal government spent almost $44 billion on elementary and secondary education programs. This funding was spread across 35 different education programs in 15 different federal departments.''All the programs that exist today were started with good intentions. Some I have advocated and numerous others I have supported. All along, all of us have tried to do the right thing. But--what have they gotten us?Today, our good intentions have gotten us burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. Parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom. The myriad of federal education programs make the jobs of our school administrators and teachers harder than they should be. Teachers are taken of the task of teaching, preparing lesson plans, taking on after school student activities and instead are researching for grant opportunities, reading regulations, preparing applications, filling out paperwork requirements, complying with cumbersome rules, and reporting on how they spend the little federal funding received. We even have teachers and administrators that decide that the little extra federal funding is not worth the time and effort that it will take to apply and comply so they do not even bother with the process. Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials we have empowered the federal government and bureaucrats.We have slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have established a system where supposedly the Olympians on the hill know what is best for the peasants in the valley.Knowing where we now are, how can we afford to keep spending our federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing for years if it is not simulating academic success for our children? We can't. Not only will I not stand for it, but parents, teachers, school boards, communities, and businesses cannot afford to stand for continued lackluster performance and failure in some cases.The President's education plan and S.1 are huge steps in the right direction recognizing that the answer to improving public education does not lie within the Halls of Congress or in the granite buildings of the downtown Washington education establishment. As an editorial from one of my homestate newspapers, the Southeast Missourian stated, ``The answer to fixing America's educational woes rests with individual school boards and passionate educators. The bureaucrats must reduce the red tape and mandates that are strangling our schools. Give those who know best the time, talent and incentives to finally fix public education.'' I agree with what the Southeast Missourian said.The President's proposal and S. 1 stress high academic achievement for all students so the achievement gap that exists will erode. The legislation stresses the importance of literacy and making certain our children can read. We know that reading is a basic, essential, and fundamental tool for personal growth and self-sufficiency. Reading provides the foundation for all other learning and eventually for productive employment. Accountability, as well as flexibility, are incorporated in the Bush plan and S. 1 to ensure that the needs of the individual child and school can be addressed while also ensuring that our tax dollars are resulting in academic success. Finally, one of the most important aspects from my perspective--advocation for increased parental involvement. It is very simple and well documented. Children whose parents are involved in their education from the very beginning are more successful in school and score higher on tests. Parents are a child's first teacher, and we can do things to help them be better teachers.Parental involvement, especially as it relates to early childhood education, is something that everyone has heard me talk a lot about, and they are going to hear more about it.There is bipartisan recognition that we must try something new to improve our public education system. My dear friend and colleague, the Senate leader from the other side of the aisle, Senator Byrd, said the following on the Senate floor in the 105th Congress:. . . when one goes the last mile of the way and concludes from what he sees, from what he hears, and from what he reads, concludes from analytical reports about public education that we are not doing well, that there is something working, then it seems to me that, in the interest of the public schools system, we may have to try a little different approach, else the confidence of the American people in that system and the support of the American people for that system are going to erode. We see that happening.From all the newspaper articles, television reports, letters to the office, et cetera, we know that the American people want more, demand more, and deserve more when it comes to public education. Let's put partisan rhetoric aside, let's move past the squabbling, and let's move forward on our common goal. Let's get on with our business. Let's have our votes. We want to be a positive contribution to educating our children for a lifetime of achievement.Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 30 minutes of postcloture debate be equally divided between the majority and minority parties and the time deducted from each Senator as provided under rule ,2015-03-17 19:08:48.758556,2015-03-17 19:08:48.758556,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED-- Continued,2001-05-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-02/html/CREC-2001-05-02-pt1-PgS4138.htm,58,25,147,S4138-S4156,B000611,mr. bond
2039,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Frist and others today to introduce the ``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999.'' I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this proposal, which will allow states to waive various federal education regulations and give them more flexibility and authority over their use of federal resources to educate their students.Mr. President, we all want our nation's children to get a first-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. Our role at the federal level should be to help states and local school districts provide the best education possible for their students.Unfortunately, many of our federal education programs, while well-intentioned, are steeped in so many rules and regulations that states and local schools consume precious time and resources to stay in compliance with the federal programs. As a former governor, I have experienced first-hand the frustration of having to jump through a lot of federal hoops to obtain and keep federal dollars designated for various programs. I have also heard of examples around the country demonstrating this same problem I experienced.For example, a 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total education funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to oversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar.The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar. Clearly, states and local school districts need relief from excessive federal regulations, which take away precious dollars and teacher time from our children.The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 will help to relieve administrative burdens and save federal resources by providing states with more flexibility to operate their education programs through the waiver of certain federal and state regulations. The bill expands to all states the highly successful Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program that is currently operating in 12 states and is producing great results. This legislation will help to reduce excessive bureaucratic oversight over education and return more control to the state and local levels.Again, I appreciate Senator Frist's dedication to providing greater flexibility to the states and I look forward to working with him to pass the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. We in Congress should support proposals--such as this one--that return decision-making authority back to state and local decision-makers, where parents, teachers, and school boards have the greatest opportunity to participate in determining priorities, developing curriculum, and making other important education-related decisions.

2040,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased again to join along with the Missouri State Senate and the Missouri House of Representatives in support of home education. The Missouri General Assembly has designated the second week of May as Home Education Week. Missouri is looked to as a leader nationwide in the home education movement. That would not be possible without the dedication of our parents who are continually committed to the strong educational principles that have ensured the success of home education. Those principles are the commitments to teaching the fundamentals in reading, writing and arithmetic.Home education has provided parents the flexibility to tailor education lessons to their child's needs. It also provides an environment where parents can apply the lessons they teach in real-life settings. That may be taking a trip to a botanical garden or national forest to learn about plant science or visiting a local newspaper to learn about a possible career in journalism, photography, printing or advertising.Home education is successful and history proves it. Since the founding of America many famous Americans have been home educated. That list includes George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Booker T. Washington, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and Sandra Day O'Connor. A most recent example was last May when Rebecca Sealfon of Brooklyn, NY won the National Spelling Bee. So when I hear that over 3,500 families in Missouri alone are home educating, I am not surprised.Without hesitation, I thank each parent who is at home teaching their child the skills they will need to succeed in the competitive world we live in today. It takes countless hours of preparation and teaching time that may seemingly go unnoticed. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed and they did not go unnoticed when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. I hope that my colleagues will join me today to let you know that those efforts are appreciated.,2015-03-17 19:08:49.058769,2015-03-17 19:08:49.058769,Extensions,IN SUPPORT OF HOME EDUCATION,1998-05-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-01/html/CREC-1998-05-01-pt1-PgE733-2.htm,52,0,144,E733,B000575,mr. blunt
2041,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I oppose this bill because it attempts to destroy local bilingual education programs and it jeopardizes the civil rights of limited English proficient students.This bill voids voluntary compliance agreements entered into by the Department of Education and local school districts that are out of compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act. This provision is an unprecedented and shameful effort to gut the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as it applies to students with limited English proficiency. The majority has never provided any justification for this assault on civil rights.This bill also repeals the current requirement that LEP students meet strong academic and performance standards. While mastery of academic English is essential to future employment success, so is the mastery of math and science and the other disciplines, and this bill has no accountability or requirement to LEP students to meet challenging standards in the core curriculum. We should never allow bilingual education students to become second class citizens and second class students.The bill also sets artificial and arbitrary time limits for completing bilingual education that would prevent teachers from doing what is best for that student. These time limits do not recognize that some children learn faster than others. I find it kind of strange that the majority would want those of us inside the beltway to dictate the duration of a school's bilingual education program rather than letting the local schools and teachers and parents decide.This legislation, Mr. Chairman, also repeals the Emergency Immigrant Education program, which provides assistance to those localities which have large numbers of recently arrived immigrants. This program is essential in cities such as Miami and Los Angeles, New York and others. So I urge my colleagues to vote against this anti-education measure.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:49.191864,2015-03-17 19:08:49.191864,House,ENGLISH LANGUAGE FLUENCY ACT,1998-09-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-09-10/html/CREC-1998-09-10-pt1-PgH7529-2.htm,119,2,144,H7529-H7554,C000488,mr. clay
2042,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again talk about the imaginary educational program of the Republican Party, this phantom program that I keep hearing from the chairman of our committee, who just stated once again that they have passed 21 bills dealing with education. And I repeat what I said in my opening remarks. There are only three educational bills that came out of that committee that are the law of the land; one is the IDEA, another is the higher education reauthorization, and the third is the Workforce Investment Act.Now, they did pass some bills; they are not the law. But the skill of legislators is to get legislation into law. One bill, the Help Scholarship Private School Voucher bill, that passed this House, it died here in the House, he takes credit for that. The Dollars to the Classroom Block Grant bill passed this House, but it died in the Senate. The bill terminating bilingual education died in the Senate. The Juvenile Justice bill died in conference. He is listing these bills as accomplishments in the field of education.His own bill, he will not bring to this floor. He has got a bill in education that he is blocking right now that he will not bring to this floor, the Reading Excellence Act. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling) will not allow his own bill to be brought to the floor because there is a little provision in there about national testing, and he is so concerned about testing that he refuses to bring his own bill to this floor. That is an imaginary list of accomplishments that the Republicans keep referring to.Three education bills have passed this Congress in this session, not 21, and I wish the gentleman from Pennsylvania would correct the record.Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record an article titled ``Significant Education Accomplishments?

2043,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate home schoolers in Missouri who are celebrating Missouri Home Education Week, May 4-10, 1997. As a parent and former teacher, I understand the vital importance of sound education in a child's development. The opportunities for students who achieve educational excellence are virtually limitless.As a U.S. Senator I fully recognize that the character and productivity of our Nation are directly linked to the quality of education provided to America's youth. Throughout my career in public service, I have been pleased to support the efforts of home schoolers to provide quality education.Home educators in Missouri are making an extra effort to give their children the best chance for success in an ever-changing society. They recognize the importance of family and judge home schooling to be the educational setting that is most appropriate. By personally guiding the scholastic endeavors of their children, home educators ensure that all facets of a child's development are considered when preparing them to become active, productive, and responsible citizens.In Missouri, home education has enjoyed considerable success in recent years because of the tremendous support received from citizens all across the State who realize the significance of family participation in the educational process. Furthermore, Missouri home schoolers are establishing one-on-one relationships with adult role models and mentors who enrich home education learning by providing hands-on business experience. This exposure to the marketplace allows home schoolers the opportunity to interact with business, community, and civic organizations.I commend the achievement realized by home schools in the State of Missouri and applaud your noble work on this special observance of Home Education Week in Missouri, May 4-10, 1997.,2015-03-17 19:08:49.605160,2015-03-17 19:08:49.605160,Senate,RECOGNITION OF HOME EDUCATION IN MISSOURI,1997-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-23/html/CREC-1997-04-23-pt1-PgS3548-3.htm,49,0,143,S3548,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2044,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. President, today I wish to honor CHARACTERplus, an organization based in my State of Missouri, which helps build strong school communities where students feel valued and can succeed. As a former classroom teacher, I appreciate the work CHARACTERplus does to help educators instill positive character traits in students--such as responsibility and respect--by teaching, encouraging and living these values at school.Created by Sanford N. McDonnell in 1985, CHARACTERplus is the largest community-wide character education organization in the country. More importantly, because of the efforts of CHARACTERplus, Missouri leads the Nation in character education.Currently more than 75 school districts across several States are members of CHARACTERplus, which serves more than 330,000 students and 29,000 teachers at 645 schools to transform school climate.Member districts and schools have unlimited access to professional development, national experts, the most current research on social, emotional and character development, skill training modules, survey tools to access school climate and opportunities to network with others in the field.Each year, the Character Education Partnership, CEP, recognizes schools that have demonstrated a commitment to character education by naming them a National School of Character. In 2013, CEP chose 29 schools, 9 of which were members of CHARACTERplus, making Missouri the national leader in character education.Those schools include Independence Elementary in the Francis Howell School District; Jefferson City Academic Center in the Jefferson City School District; Beasley Elementary, Bierbaum Elementary, Hagemann Elementary, and Mehlville High School in the Mehlville School District; Chesterfield Elementary and LaSalle Springs Middle School in the Rockwood School District; and Discovery Ridge Elementary in the Wentzville School District.CHARACTERplus also works closely with the Missouri Department of Secondary and Elementary Education on several projects and runs the State School of Character Awards.I would like to congratulate CHARACTERplus for all of their hard work and commend them for helping the State of Missouri be a leader in character education. ,2015-03-17 19:08:49.849331,2015-03-17 19:08:49.849331,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2013-11-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-11-13/html/CREC-2013-11-13-pt1-PgS7998-2.htm,161,0,159,S7998,B000575,mr. blunt

It is of paramount importance that today's youth have a firm grasp of the principles and ideals outlined in this hallowed document.Mr. Speaker, as you may know, President Bush declared September 17th through September 23rd Constitution Week to commemorate the September 17, 1787 signing of the Constitution. I rise today to recognize Constitution Week and to honor civic education leaders and programs that have played an integral role in educating Missouri's youth about the Constitution.One exemplary program worthy of particular praise is We the People: the Citizen and Constitution. This program educates students in junior high and high school on the merits of a Constitutional democracy and discusses the material in a manner that provides relevance to the students and creates a model for student civic life.I want to draw particular praise for Millie Aulbur, who is the Director of Law-Related Education for the Missouri Bar. She has been a pillar in the civic education community, and her diligent work and strong leadership have vastly improved civic education programs in my home state. Likewise, she has been extremely effective in raising awareness of this issue with Missouri's Congressional delegation. Millie has recently succeeded in establishing a coalition of civic education leaders, known as the Advisory Committee for Civic Education of the Missouri Bar. I have known Millie since before coming to Congress, having served with her in the Missouri Attorney General office. I can say unequivocally that she is one of the finest and hard-working individuals I know. Her commitment to civic education and Missouri's youth is highly commendable.Without these civic education programs and leaders, we run the risk that future generations of Americans will lack knowledge of the document upon which our democracy is based. Millie Aulbur's efforts set a fine example, and I urge my colleagues to learn more about civic education programs in their Congressional districts and to assist these valued civic educators in this noble endeavor.,2015-03-17 19:08:50.038467,2015-03-17 19:08:50.038467,Extensions,CONSTITUTION WEEK AND CIVIC EDUCATORS,2004-10-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-10-04/html/CREC-2004-10-04-pt1-PgE1788-3.htm,123,0,150,E1788,H000948,mr. hulshof
2046,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, all of us agree that it is important to send the vast majority of education dollars to the classroom. In fact, that is exactly what the Federal Government is doing right now according to the new report by the GAO. On September 30, GAO released an analysis of the top 10 education programs and found that the Department of Education distributed over 99 percent of the money to the States.The States, in turn, distributed an average of 94 percent of the funds they received to local school districts. Far from the bureaucratic nightmare of wasted Federal dollars repeatedly alleged by some in the Republican majority, GAO found that States used their funds on providing technical assistance to local educational agencies, to professional development for teachers, to program evaluation and to curricula development.Mr. Speaker, GAO also surveyed local school administrators in nine representative school districts and made the following emphatic conclusion, and I quote: ``We found that State staffs spent very little time administering the programs and that district office staff also generally spent little time administering them,'' end of quote.Mr. Speaker, it is quite ironic that this GAO study was not requested by Democrats, but by the majority, Republican majority. Now I suspect that some of those who requested this study were hoping that it would be a hit job on the Department of Education. Instead, it confirms what we have said all along. The Department of Education spends less than 1 percent of funds on administration.So I hope that this new GAO report will stop those who would falsely demagogue the administration of the Department of Education programs. We want solutions, not false and empty resolutions. The majority's funding plan for education is in shambles. We should get on with finishing the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act instead of wasting time on this blatant effort to undermine public support for Federal education spending.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:50.193576,2015-03-17 19:08:50.193576,House,SENSE OF THE HOUSE URGING 95 PERCENT OF FEDERAL EDUCATION DOLLARS BE SPENT IN THE CLASSROOM,1999-10-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-12/html/CREC-1999-10-12-pt1-PgH9843-2.htm,137,4,145,H9843-H9847,C000488,mr. clay

The criteria for STARS recognition is based on the National Standards for Physical Education, specifically, educationally and developmentally appropriate instructional strategies and teaching skills, adequate facilities and equipment that are safe and appropriate for the age and abilities of the students and that enable students to participate in the maximum amount of active time on task, and classes taught by certified physical educators.A quality school physical education program is the foundation for helping all children develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence that promote lifelong physical activity. By improving the quality of school physical education programs across the country, we will have a direct effect on the health of America's children.I want to thank the fine educators of Chesterfield Elementary School for their commitment to the health and education of our future generations and congratulate them on the successful renewal of their STARS status in 2008.,2015-03-17 19:08:50.649901,2015-03-17 19:08:50.649901,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO PRINCIPAL JILL RAMSEY AND TEACHERS MR.

2050,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes to respond to the gentleman from Texas.Under existing law that the President signed last June, here is who can contribute into a Coverdell education account. By the way, this is mirrored on the premise of the Roth IRA; that is, that one contributes monies into a savings account and then the interest that builds up, the power of compound interest, as Einstein talked about, as that interest builds up, it is tax-free if used in a Roth IRA, for instance, for retirement expenses and in the Coverdell account for education expenses.Here is who can contribute to an education account: anyone. Parents, teachers, mentors, small business owners, corporations, charities, foundations, labor unions, concerned citizens, church groups, anybody can designate funds to go into an education account for any child.Now, I would say to the gentleman, in fact, this is new resources, incentives that would not be committed to education but for the fact that we put them in the Tax Code and provide this tax incentive. This year alone, this year alone, 3.5 billion more private dollars are being allocated specifically to educating our kids just this year.The other point I would make is simply, everyone keeps talking about the budget picture. Again, keep in mind that there is absolutely no budget impact, or a minimal budget impact, making this permanent until the year 2010 and 2011.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:50.805005,2015-03-17 19:08:50.805005,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE PERMANENCE ACT OF 2002,2002-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-04/html/CREC-2002-09-04-pt1-PgH6022.htm,110,21,148,H6022-H6028,H000948,mr. hulshof
2051,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Families for Home Education (FHE) in observance of Home Education Week, May 2-8, in my home State of Missouri. I join with the Missouri General Assembly in recognizing their commitment not only to excellence in education, but also to the promotion of public policy that strengthens the family.Home educators make tremendous sacrifices to educate our nation's young people and they are making a difference. Countless studies show that parental involvement positively impacts the education of a child. Home-schooled children, in particular, benefit greatly from the individualized, one-on-one training they receive from dedicated parents and home educators. They are also afforded unique opportunities to participate in apprenticeships, and community and civic organizations. These activities serve to strengthen social skills and enrich their overall educational experience.In today's challenging society, it is more important than ever that our young people receive a quality education if they are to succeed in the expanding global market. Home educators play a vital part in preparing children, tomorrow's workforce, to successfully compete and prosper in the adult world. I commend these dedicated parents and FHE, and wish them continued success in their endeavors. ,2015-03-17 19:08:50.960122,2015-03-17 19:08:50.960122,Senate,RECOGNITION OF FAMILIES FOR HOME EDUCATION,1999-04-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-29/html/CREC-1999-04-29-pt1-PgS4469-5.htm,60,0,145,S4469-S4470,B000611,mr. bond
2052,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senior Senator from Missouri for his introduction of the ``Direct Check for Education'' bill. It is with great pleasure that I add my name as a cosponsor of this important legislation, which will improve the educational opportunities for our nation's school children by sending federal resources directly to local school districts to use in the way they know will benefit students most effectively.Mr. President, when we talk about education, we should start by asking: ``What do our parents want for their children? We know that parents want their children to get a first-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. Parents want schools that are safe, classes that are small, and principals and teachers to have authority to make the right decisions in all areas of learning, school discipline and after-school activities. Parents want teachers who care for students and know the subjects they teach. Parents do not want Washington in control of classrooms.The next question we should ask is: How can we attain what parents want? How can our children achieve academic excellence? The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question in a report released in July of 1998, called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The Subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives, but instead were characterized by: parental involvement in the education of their children, local control, emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance.Knowing the ingredients of educational success for our children, we must next ask whether our current federal education programs contain these ingredients.First, we should observe that in a sense, the federal government has played conflicting roles in education, providing resources with one hand, while creating obstacles with the other. We have spent over $12 billion on major education programs in the last two years, and this year, we are slated to spend nearly $15 billion. Yet, if current trends continue, only about 65% of federal education dollars will be spent this year on educating our children, due to the excessive bureaucracy in our federal programs.And we should remember that federal funding accounts for only about 7% of the total amount spent on education, while the lion's share comes from state and local taxes. However, that 7% of the funding pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts need to administer education programs. Unfortunately, most federal education programs often do not contain the basic ingredients for educational success, but rather contain components that can actually stifle the ingredients for success.In the last 35 years, the federal government has continued to take away parental involvement, local control, flexibility, and teacher and community input by spinning a complex web of federal elementary and secondary education programs, each of which contain their own set of rules that consume the time and resources of states and school districts.A 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total education funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to oversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar.Many federal programs have taken away precious dollars and teacher time. Rather than being able to spend time on classroom preparation, teachers instead have to spend hours filling out federal forms to comply with federal rules.Another problem with a number of our federal education programs is that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars that their parents pay for education. This is because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. In essence, local schools must come to Washington and beg for the money taxpayers sent to the federal treasury. As a result, smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer, cannot share in the money their parents sent to the federal government.To make matters worse, once a school district is successful in obtaining a competitive grant after a harrowing application process, it must spend countless hours and resources complying with the leviathan of regulations and rules attached to the grant.Competitive funding, along with the vast number of federal education programs, has led to a cottage industry in selling information on education program descriptions, filing instructions, and application deadlines for each of these programs. The ``Education at a Crossroads'' report I mentioned earlier describes this cottage industry:``The Education Funding Research Council identifies potential sources of funds for local school districts, and sells for nearly $400 the Guide to Federal Funding for Education. The company promises to steer its subscribers to ``a wide range of Federal programs,'' and offers these subscribers timely updates on ``500 education programs.'' More recently, the Aid for Education Report published by CD Publications advertised that ``huge sums are available. . .in the federal government alone, there are nearly 800 different education programs that receive authorization totaling almost a hundred billion dollars.''It's a shame that a school district has to pay $400 for a catalog to learn how to get back the money that its community has sent to Washington to educate its children. But sadly, this is often the case.A third problem we can identify with many current federal education programs is that federal dollars are often earmarked for one particular use, and cannot be used for any other purpose. This inflexible funding hurts schools that have other needs than the ones prescribed by the federal government. A recent example of this is the $1.2 billion earmarked last year for classroom size reduction. While more teachers and class size reduction are noble endeavors, some schools don't need more teachers, but instead need more computers. However, the only use of this $1.2 billion can be for hiring more teachers. Such a policy flies in the face of one ingredient for educational success, local control.So, we know we have created a lot of federal education programs and we have dedicated a great deal of resources for these programs. What results are we getting? The National Center for Education Statistics' NAEP 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States reveals that 40 percent of fourth graders do not read at a basic level. The same report also indicates that half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time, if at all. And the NAEP Report Card also shows that United States 12th graders only outperformed two out of 21 nations in mathematics. The Brookings Institution released a study in April of 1998 indicating that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students.Knowing these disastrous results, we cannot afford to keep spending our federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing for years if it's not stimulating academic success. Parents, teachers, school boards, and members of our community won't stand for this kind of failure. They want and need opportunities to be more involved in deciding how to spend the federal education dollar, because they know what works. We must spend our federal resources for elementary and secondary education in ways that embrace the ingredients of success.Rather than fund the patchwork of federal elementary and secondary education programs that Washington wants, Congress should send that money directly to local school districts. Parents and teachers need the financing, flexibility and freedom to fund programs they know will improve their children's education.Senator Bond's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal does just this. He takes some of the Department of Education's largest competitive grant programs and returns the money in the form of a ``direct check'' to the local school districts based on the number of students in each district. Schools may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement.Under the ``Direct Check'' proposal, no longer would school districts have to come to Washington and beg for the money they sent to Washington to educate their children. No longer would teachers and administrators have to spend countless and wasted hours filling out federal grant application and compliance forms. No longer would schools be forced to earmark federal dollars for programs that have no relevance to their students' needs. Rather, school districts with the input of teachers, school boards, administrators, and of course, parents, would have the authority and flexibility to use federal dollars for what they best see fit.For example, local schools could deploy resources to hire new teachers, raise teacher salaries, buy new textbooks or new computers--whatever the schools deem most important to the educational success of their students. The Direct Check to Education proposals gives schools more time, flexibility, and money to spend on what's most important: providing classroom instruction to our nation's children.With the flexible, equitable distribution of federal funding under Senator Bond's proposal comes accountability. Local school districts will be penalized for knowingly submitting false information regarding the number of students in their districts. Moreover, the Secretary of Education may audit local educational agency expenditures to ensure that funds are used in accordance with the Direct Check in Education Act. And most importantly, parents, school boards, and members of the community will be able to give direct input into funding decisions, since those decisions will be made right in the community, rather than hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of miles away in Washington, D.C. Local decision making allows for local accountability.Mr. President, we have learned from experience that our many of our current federal education programs and dollars are not producing what we expect for our students. We know that successful education programs occur when crucial decisions are made by local communities, teachers, school boards, and parents. This is why I support Senator Bond's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal. His plan embraces the ingredients of educational success, as it gives parents, teachers and school boards the authority and flexibility to direct funds to programs they know work for their children.As I said earlier, Senator Bond's proposal consolidates a number of the Department of Education's federal programs for elementary and secondary education. I believe we should explore whether other federal education programs--both within and outside the Department of Education--should also be taken and put into a ``direct check'' to our local school districts. We must continue to look for ways to direct our federal resources in ways that reflect the ingredients of success and educational excellence for our children.

2053,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Souder]. I ask to speak to the House today only because we have carried the debate on this amendment over the weekend, from Friday to today.Certainly, the gentleman from Maryland suggested that there were people who would be supporting this amendment who had voted one way or another in 1995. I know many of my friends will support this amendment who are friends of vocational education and would not have been voting the way he suggested in 1995. I know for sure I did not vote that way in 1995, since I was not here in 1995.Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment about whether we are going to increase funding for OSHA or increase funding for vocational education. It is $11 million, the increase in the OSHA bill. Apparently, the vocational education, adult education appropriation had no increase.At one time, in the early information that we received, it said that there was an $11 million decrease in vocational education. That got me to thinking about why at a time when we are focusing on welfare reform, when we are focusing on getting people to work, when we have just made the significant steps we made to encourage education beyond high school with the tax bill that many of the people who are speaking against this amendment were appropriately and actively for, we would want to just leave vocational education in place and perhaps even cut vocational education, as the early analysis of the bill said we were going to do.Mr. Chairman, assuming vocational education is where it was last year, and we have $11 million, the question that this amendment really brings to the floor is whether we take that $11 million and spend it for more OSHA or we take that $11 million and spend it for more vocational and adult education.This process is about choices. This amendment proposes a different choice than the choice presented by the committee. I am a believer in vocational education. I think vocational education may very well, one could argue, be more important than it has ever been as we try to move people to the workplace that have not been to the workplace.Clearly, OSHA is not achieving the results in the workplace that we want to achieve. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Clay], who mentioned the numbers of deaths appropriately, we should be concerned about those numbers of deaths. But the gentleman also mentioned that there are inspectors in OSHA that would allow every business to be inspected only once every 167 years.Mr. Chairman, I think a better way to provide workplace safety, even these two choices, is to train people before they go to the workplace so that they are better prepared to be there. I think that is a better effort to get workplace safety than an $11 million increase in OSHA would be.Certainly, the vocational education reforms that this Congress will approve spend money more nearly at the local level. I think that is a good change in vocational education. Ninty percent of the money will be spent for the first time under these new guidelines at the local level. This will be money that is spent to strengthen academics, to broaden opportunities after high school, to send more dollars to classrooms for people who are not headed to college.Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of American youth do not complete a 4-year college degree. Those people are very much in need of additional beyond-high school training.Mr. Chairman, it is clear that more than half of the new jobs that have been and will be created in the decade of the 1990s will take education beyond high school. Well, 25 to 35 percent of the people going to high school are not graduating from high school to start with in virtually any State. The 75 percent that do not graduate from college need that additional training to fill the jobs that are created in this decade, for many of them their first decade in the workplace.I think vocational education is important. I think adult education is important. By the way, this amendment does not say to take the money out of compliance or even to take it out of inspection. It takes the money out of OSHA and puts money in the Perkins bill vocational education.Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of that money goes to vocational education; 10 percent goes to programs for single parents; 8 percent to State level programs and activities; and 5 percent for State administration. Ninty cents of these dollars are getting directly to individuals.This is about choices. I am encouraging the choice that this amendment proposes and appreciate the opportunity to get to address the House on this day, the second day that we deal with this legislation.,2015-03-17 19:08:51.321373,2015-03-17 19:08:51.321373,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-08/html/CREC-1997-09-08-pt1-PgH6977-5.htm,117,31,143,H6977-H6999,B000575,mr. blunt
2054,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I believe the fundamental opportunity in education and the opportunity for achievement by children relates to the involvement of parents in education. Whenever we begin to dictate curriculum from Washington, with a national test which will ultimately define curriculum, we will have lost the genius of America's education system, which is local involvement in schools, parental involvement.For that reason, I believe this amendment should be adopted. I am pleased that Senator Lott has been in support of this amendment. I am pleased that a number of other individuals are supporting it strongly and am glad to have the cosponsorship of Senator Hagel. I urge its adoption.I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nickles be added as a cosponsor.,2015-03-17 19:08:51.485489,2015-03-17 19:08:51.485489,Senate,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS,1998-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-22/html/CREC-1998-04-22-pt1-PgS3410.htm,45,119,144,S3410-S3423,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2055,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Mary Ann Schiller with the Affirm School District. She began working in the Affton School District as a high school senior in 1950 as an assistant to the superintendent's secretary. She attended Miss Hickey's Secretarial School in the evening while working as secretary to the principal at Reavis School during the day.In 1960 she moved to the administration center to serve the assistant superintendent of elementary education. In 1970, Mrs. Schiller became the secretary to the superintendent (later administrative assistant) as well as secretary to the Board of Education, positions she held for 40 years. She has been the indispensable ``right hand'' to eight superintendents and a patient mentor to nearly 70 Board of Education members.On June 15, 2010, the Affton School District's Board of Education unanimously voted to dedicate and rename the Affton School District Administration Center in her honor. On October 2, 2010 the administration center will be renamed the Mary Ann Schiller Administration Center.Other honors for Mary Ann include: the recipient of the Service and Outstanding Achievement Recognition (SOAR) Award for 1996-97; named Affton Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year in 1999; and one of ten distinguished alumni inducted into the Affton Hall of Fame in 2005.Mary Ann was also named by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as a Pioneer in Education--an honor never before bestowed upon a classified school district employee.Mary Ann Schiller retired on June 30, 2010 after 60 years of service to the Affton School District. I honor Mary Ann today for her outstanding public service; performing one of the most important tasks necessary for a successful and healthy nation: educating the young and preparing them to be productive and responsible citizens.,2015-03-17 19:08:51.638603,2015-03-17 19:08:51.638603,Extensions,HONORING MARY ANN SCHILLER,2010-09-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-29/html/CREC-2010-09-29-PT2-PgE1845.htm,133,0,156,E1845,C001060,mr. carnahan
2056,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Missouri home schoolers who will observe Missouri Home Education Week, May 3-May 9, 1998. As a parent and former educator, it is a privilege for me to participate in celebrating this event.As a nation we promote education as a key to success. A good education is associated with responsible, intelligent, and productive citizenship. To maintain greatness as a nation, we must strive for excellence as individuals. And the standard of excellence is largely set by our nation's leaders--especially those in the home. Training in the home that guides children in setting the highest standards for their lives is essential to the continuity of morality in our culture. I am encouraged by all parents and students who take on the task of education in the home.There is no bigger responsibility than being a parent. It is my desire that parents be role models to their children. Teachers have always had a place as role models in our society. Each of us can probably remember a teacher who pushed us to achieve more and to reach higher. We are thankful for the leadership of those who promote education and serve as role models. So for home schooling parents, may you find inspiration in performing the dual role of parent and teacher, and may you be doubly rewarded for your efforts.In Missouri, home schooling has had great success. I look forward to the continued contributions that Missouri home schoolers will have in education and to the positive impact home schooled children will have in Missouri's communities and across the United States.,2015-03-17 19:08:51.774695,2015-03-17 19:08:51.774695,Senate,MISSOURI HOME SCHOOLERS,1998-03-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-30/html/CREC-1998-03-30-pt1-PgS2763-2.htm,38,0,144,S2763,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2057,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, let me take this time to honor a dedicated military educator, Lieutenant General Frances C. Wilson, who will be retiring as the President of the National Defense University, after having served this nation for 37 years in the United States Marine Corps.Culminating with her appointment as President of the National Defense University in 2006, General Wilson has, throughout her career, focused on professional education while working tirelessly to create an educated and well-trained class of American warriors. She has completed seven advanced training courses, including Harvard's Senior Executive Course in National Security, and earned four Master degrees along with a Doctorate in Education. Through these impressive academic undertakings, General Wilson acquired the knowledge and skills needed to prepare America's future officers for the complex contemporary world.Most impressively, General Wilson has relentlessly used her extensive education to increase the capabilities of our Armed Forces. She commanded the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island, directed the Manpower Management Division at Marine Corps Headquarters, and managed the military's Reserve forces while a member of the Reserve Force Policy Board. Through her leadership in these posts, General Wilson greatly advanced the professional development of the marines under her command and helped to mold a vibrant military education system.As President of the National Defense University, General Wilson understood the critical need for National Security Professionals within the Executive Branch. She spearheaded the development of the National Security Education Consortium and, recognizing the importance of international cooperation, established educational partnerships with 79 nations, especially our NATO allies. Additionally, she added three Masters degrees to the University's curriculum while managing NDU's reaccredidation process. As a strong proponent of military education myself, I could not be more pleased with General Wilson's efforts or the many accolades she has received over her long career.General Wilson's leadership has strengthened both the Marine Corps and the professional military education system. As a staunch believer in continuous education for professional soldiers, I am proud of her commitment to lifelong study and the development of America's warriors. I trust that Members of the House will join me in congratulating General Wilson for her contributions to the United States of America.,2015-03-17 19:08:51.893785,2015-03-17 19:08:51.893785,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL FRANCES C.

2058,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and support Arts Advocacy Day. I would like to thank the artists who have come to Capitol Hill to visit with members of Congress regarding support for arts education as essential to the creative ingenuity of the cultural fabric of our society. We appreciate their extraordinary talent and we welcome them to Washington.The Congress must provide sufficient funding for arts education in our schools and the National Endowment for the Arts. These programs are vital to supporting the creation, preservation and presentation of the arts and humanities in America. In my district, numerous schools have taken essential steps toward integrating arts education in their student's daily routines. Unfortunately, budget cuts threaten the longevity of these programs. Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. A U.S. Department of Justice study found that arts education reduced student delinquency in San Antonio by 13% and increased the communications skills of students in Atlanta by 57%. Test Results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores that other students. I'm proud to have been part of the legislative effort to empower the Secretary of Education to fund arts education programs in our schools through the No Child Left Behind Education Act of 2003.Beyond our borders, the WTO must stand firm against the piracy of our artists' intellectual property. We in Congress must strengthen our commitment and effort with our trading partners to end piracy. Theft of intellectual property has a significant economic affect on the United States. The recording industry, for example, reports a loss of $286 million in sales with our trading partner, China. In addition, market access and investment barriers prevent the entertainment industry from serving markets overseas thus and increases demand for pirated U.S. entertainment products. The Congress and the United States Trade Representative need to work together to apply pressure to the governments of countries where piracy is rampant.Mr. Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to Arts Advocacy Day.,2015-03-17 19:08:52.026879,2015-03-17 19:08:52.026879,Extensions,ARTS ADVOCACY DAY,2004-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-31/html/CREC-2004-03-31-pt1-PgE497-3.htm,43,0,150,E497-E498,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

It is the shame of their party.The Republican policy toward education is based on the contemptuous premise that education is not the province of the Federal Government. So, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans will do as little as possible to improve our educational system, and then only when forced to do it. Their sorry, sordid record on education issues is one of complete failure.They fail to invest in the expansion of after-school programs, they fail to reduce classroom sizes, they fail to bring new technology to our schools, they fail to replace dilapidated school houses and replace them with new buildings.They failed to hire 100,000 new public school teachers.Mr. Speaker, Republicans have failed our school children, failed their parents, failed our public school teachers and failed their responsibility to give leadership in the area of critical national concern. Their scheme to enact school vouchers would have diverted hundreds of millions of Federal dollars earmarked for public schools and school reform to private and parochial schools.Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority tried to repeal affirmative action programs for disadvantaged youth and tried to destroy bilingual education. Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Republicans' most sinister, most cynical, perversion was the attempt to kill the Head Start program by loading it down with nongermane killer amendments like Head Start vouchers.In the past few days, we have seen a flurry of activity on measures that have languished for the past 2 years, but the record of this do-nothing Congress in the field of education is clear.Thus far, only three education bills have become law during this Congress: job training, higher education renewal and the IDEA program.Mr. Speaker, we demand, the American public demands, that the Republican leadership take immediate action to enact legislation to modernize our decrepit, run-down public schools and to reduce our classrooms to manageable and teachable sizes.Mr. Speaker, we should vote this rule down. This proposal is bad for this country and we should stay here until we finish the business of government, the business of the American people. I say vote ``no'' on this resolution.,2015-03-17 19:08:52.260044,2015-03-17 19:08:52.260044,House,WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 4(B) OF RULE XI WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS REPORTED FROM COMMITTEE ON RULES,1998-10-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-10/html/CREC-1998-10-10-pt1-PgH10356-6.htm,142,7,144,H10356-H10365,C000488,mr. clay
2060,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, we can act to ensure that our legislative policies empower parents, teachers, principals and administrators with the ability to ensure that our children have a safe learning environment. I believe that is something we owe America.Current Federal education laws preclude schools from dealing with early warning signs of danger. It is time for us to end that. I am pleased that we have done it to a small degree in the Ed-Flex measure.I am grateful for the sponsors of this measure and for the excellent work they have done for America and education.,2015-03-17 19:08:52.416157,2015-03-17 19:08:52.416157,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT,1999-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-21/html/CREC-1999-04-21-pt1-PgS3984.htm,55,15,145,S3984-S4005,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2061,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, this week is National Teacher Appreciation week and our attention is focused on education. As the elected Representative of Missouri's Ninth Congressional District, I have the distinct honor of representing sixteen colleges and universities, and a plethora of public and private schools which help prepare students to enter these educational institutions.Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to honor all of the hard working individuals who work in these educational institutions in central and northeastern Missouri. Each and every one deserves accolades for their role in providing excellence in education.Today, however, I would like to point the national spotlight to highlight one of many devoted teachers who have dedicated their lives to provide quality education in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District.Last month, Mr. Stan Taylor of Columbia, Missouri, stopped by my district office to request a congratulations letter be sent to his wife, Karen, on her retirement from the Columbia Public School system. Karen began teaching in 1961 in a rural, one room school house called East Center School in Kirksville, Missouri. She had the tremendous responsibility for teaching all grades, first through twelve, at East Center School.In 1967, Karen began teaching within the Columbia Public School District, and for the last twenty years she has taught second grade elementary school at Rock Bridge Elementary School in Columbia, Missouri.Mr. Speaker, as I learned of Karen's dedication to improve education in Missouri's Ninth District, I felt if befitting that I recognize her special efforts, and in doing so, I honor all of those like her who have dedicated their professional lives to help enhance the education of their students.Not surprisingly, I do not stand alone in placing this honor. On May 22nd, the Missouri Teachers Association and more than 300 people--family, friends, colleagues and former students--will help celebrate Karen's educational efforts at Rock Bridge Elementary School during a reception to commemorate her retirement after twenty years of teaching in the Columbia Public School system.Mr. Speaker, I would like to close with Mr. Taylor's words about his wife. He wrote that the most important lesson Karen stressed to her students was the power of knowledge through reading. Every day she would read to her students. It was her goal throughout her thirty year teaching career to encourage every student to become believers in the importance of reading. Thank-you Karen, for your devotion to your students and for providing excellent education for many generations of children. I stand here today to honor you and all those who share your commitment towards excellence in education. May we all celebrate National Teacher Appreciation Week with those who have given us the priceless gift of education.,2015-03-17 19:08:52.572268,2015-03-17 19:08:52.572268,House,``BELIEVERS IN READING'' HONORING KAREN TAYLOR AND NATIONAL TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK,1999-05-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-05/html/CREC-1999-05-05-pt1-PgH2780.htm,64,1,145,H2780,H000948,mr. hulshof
2062,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I strongly support and urge Congress to pass and President Clinton to sign the Affordable Education Act now pending before the Senate. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation.Children presently are 25 percent of our population and 100 percent of the future. It is my fundamental belief that Congress should invest in the future by improving educational opportunities for students. This bill is part of a comprehensive strategy to give parents and local schools the resources needed to make the 21st century, the era in which educational excellence for all students is achieved.For the past three years, Congress has passed legislation that provides tax incentives to help parents pay for the education of their children. But President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation that provided these incentives. Parents across America hope and trust that this time these tax incentives will be enacted into law.A major feature of this bill is that it creates Educational Savings Accounts for K through 12 expenses. These ESAs allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually to an Educational Savings Account. The build-up of earnings within the account is tax-free if used for educational expenses, such as tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, computers, etc. The premise behind ESAs is that parents should have greater control over the education of their children. After all, who is in a better position to know what each child needs--a bureaucratic Washington government or the parents and teachers who see that child every day?This bill does more than just create Educational Savings Accounts. Included in this bill are other provisions that I have either supported or co-sponsored that:Provide tax incentives to help pay for college tuition;Provide tax exclusions for education assistance programs provided by employers;Revise the tax treatment of qualified state tuition programs to exclude from gross income any distributions used for higher education expenses;Allow a tax deduction of up to $2,500 per year of interest on education loans;Allow a limited tax credit for the donation of computers to schools, and extends from two to three years the age of computers that may be donated to schools; andReduce the complexity of the arbitrage rules that currently govern the issuance of school bonds.This bill provides more than $4.3 billion of education tax incentives for the next five years, and it gives more educational control to parents. Parents will be able to save more for the future education of their children.This bill is just one part of an overall strategy to increase educational resources. Over the past five years Congress has increased overall educational spending by 40 percent, and Congress last year approved a budget that projects yet another 36 percent increase over the next four years. In the next few weeks Congress will take up legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I will be offering amendments to that bill that will:Channel federal aid in failing school districts to teaching the academic basics in order to raise student achievement levels;Provide funds for failing school districts to use in attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers; andDouble the amount of federal aid for college costs for high achieving students in failing school districts.For now, however, Congress should take the first step in expressing its commitment to improving education by passing the pending Affordable Education Act. I urge Senators to support this legislation.,2015-03-17 19:08:52.727378,2015-03-17 19:08:52.727378,Senate,AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999--Continued,2000-03-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-02/html/CREC-2000-03-02-pt1-PgS1088.htm,22,206,146,S1088-S1111,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2063,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, as we start this 106th Congress, I think it is clear that education is going to be one of the top priorities we will address in this session of Congress. We are going to be working on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and I believe all of us, on both sides, are saying that this is a national priority.As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry, said in a speech that he made at Northeastern University, ``Ever since there has been a United States of America, there have been public schools. And there has been a constant debate about how to make them work.'' I know that since I was elected to the United States Senate 12 years ago I have listened and participated in the many debates on public education that have occurred in this institution. I have even had some ideas of my own on how to improve education--some of which have been passed by this body and signed into law.My intentions, like those of my Senate colleagues--have been good intentions. We all share the same goal of providing our children with a great education. We have been trying to do the right thing.Today, however, our good intentions have mushroomed into burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. Parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom. Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials we have empowered the federal government and bureaucrats. We have slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have once again established a system where supposedly the Olympians on the hill know what is best for the peasants in the valley.Mr. President, let me give you some examples of what our good intentions have gotten us.We have 760 education programs scattered throughout 39 different federal agencies. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review said that the Department of Education's discretionary grant process lasts 26 weeks and takes 487 steps from start to finish. The General Accounting Office has estimated that there are nearly 13,400 full-time jobs in the 50 states funded by the Department of Education with an additional 4,600 direct Department of Education employees.We have teachers being taken off the task of teaching, preparing lesson plans, taking on after school student activities, etc. and instead are researching for grant opportunities, reading regulations, preparing applications, filling out paperwork requirements, complying with cumbersome rules, and reporting on how they spend the federal money received. Or we have teachers and administrators deciding that the extra federal money is not worth the time and effort that it will take to get and comply with that they do not even bother to go through the process.Most of us are now aware of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, released last year by the National Center for Education Statistics, that ranked American senior high school students 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in math, and 16th out of the same 21 countries in science. In addition, 40 percent of our Nation's fourth graders do not read at even a basic level. Colleges across this country are spending over $1 billion a year in remedial education.Is this acceptable? Are we satisfied with the status quo? The answer should be--must be--an unequivocal NO.In our business we pay a lot of attention to polls. For several years, the polls across the country have been telling us that we have a problem with public education. This is not new news and the question remains the same: How do we fix public education?Mr. President, before I provide my answer to that question I want to take this opportunity to read from an editorial from a home-state newspaper, the Southeast Missourian.Nearly a decade ago, then-President Bush and the nation's governors set a series of goals for America's schoolchildren in reading, math, graduation rates and other measures. But the national education goals panel says the nation's public schools will fall short of the goals for 2000. We can only hope these continued failures to improve education will result in a overthrow of the so-called experts. These are the people, usually far removed from the classroom, who embrace quick fixes and fads in the face of each hand-wringing report. Unfortunately, the fixes make the problems worse. What's needed is to return America's schools back to the basics and back to local teachers, administrators, school boards, and parents. Without a foundation in the basics, the rest of education just won't take. We must take so-called remedies out of the hands of the federal government. National mandates are meaningless for America's schools. The problem must be addressed one district and one school at a time. Why not let classroom teachers-- instead of bureaucrats and politicians--fashion a plan to improve learning in the classroom? Give more control to the local districts in building reading retention, math skills and graduation rates?Mr. President, the editorial goes on, but it ends with the following:The answer to fixing America's educational woes rests with individual school boards and passionate educators. The bureaucrats must reduce the red tape and mandates that are strangling our schools. Give those who know best the time, talent and incentives to finally fix public education.I agree with the Southeast Missourian. The answer to improving public education does not lie within the halls of Congress or in the granite buildings of the downtown Washington education establishment. As the editorial stated, we are ``far removed from the classroom.''In my opinion, the real solutions--the laboratories--are local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not play the ``Mother, May I?'' game with Washington.Here in Congress we must not be afraid to propose change. But in proposing change we must go directly to those who can provide some answers--the teachers, principals, school administrators, school board members, and parents.For the past couple of years, I have done just that and have developed in conjunction with them the ``Direct Check for Education Act.Quite simply, the purpose of this bill is to consolidate six, primarily competitive grant programs of the Department of Education's programs. The programs are Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program. The bill then proposes to return the federal funding by issuing a ``Direct Check'' to the local school district based on the number of students in each district. The result would be a resource of flexible funding that would allow individual schools and parents to determine how best to use the funds, including the hiring of new teachers, additional classrooms, new textbooks, expanded technology initiatives, drug and alcohol prevention programs, etc. The list goes on and on.My ``Direct Check'' proposal is not the ``save-all'' answer. But the ``Direct Check'' will reduce the costly and time-consuming paperwork process that local school districts endure in obtaining federal grants and funding. It will treat children and schools the same by awarding funding to schools based upon the students served instead of rewarding some and penalizing others. My ``Direct Check for Education'' is a first step in simplifying and going ``back to the basics'' of education.Mr. President, there will be those in the Washington education establishment who will oppose this bill. Instead of finding ways to empower those at the local level the opposition will argue that we need even more federal programs, more bureaucracy, more micro management of the classroom.I believe the bottom line is this: Education, while a national priority, is a local responsibility. We must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, school boards, etc. because education decisions can best be made by people at the local schools who know the names and the challenges facing the students in those schools.Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold and let local school districts do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement.We have burdened it with excessive regulations and red tape. We have once again established a system where supposedly the ``olympians'' on the Hill know what is best for the ``peasants'' in the valley.I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Education is and must be a national priority. But the good intentions that we have had in this body have led to the creation of more than 760 Federal education programs. Has that made education better? I don't think so. We added three more last year. And now we gather that the President is going to come up with a grand new Federal scheme. How many people really believe that the 764th Federal education program is going to assure that our kids can read? Is it going to assure that we get our high school students out of the 19th place out of 21 in terms of mathematics? I don't believe so.Our system is not working. If you want to know how well it is working, go back home. Ask the teachers in your local school district. Ask the principals in your local school district. Ask the parents at home. Ask the school board members. If you do that, I believe you will hear what I have heard, time and time again: They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government. They are tired of spending the time to fill out the forms for the grants, to comply and jump through the hoops that the Federal Government sets out for them, to write the reports and fill out the evaluation forms that are needed, only to have a competitive grant program run out at the end of 3 years. They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government.We have an opportunity to do something that I think is very significant. Instead of going down the road that is going to be proposed of another new Federal program, we ought to take the remedies out of the hands of the Federal Government. National mandates are meaningless for American schools. The problems must be addressed one school district, one school, at a time. Why not let classroom teachers, the parents, the administrators--instead of bureaucrats and politicians--make the decisions on how to improve the education in their school districts? Give more control back to local districts and let them build reading retention, math skills, and improve graduation rates.Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill we call the direct check for education bill. It takes six of the major Federal competitive grant programs--Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, the Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program--and puts them into a pool. That pool is to be divided on the basis of the students--K through 12--on average daily attendance. And it is to be returned to those local school districts on the basis of the number of students they have. Very simple. Cut the Federal red tape. Let them use those education dollars.It starts off with a $3.5-million authorization, because we want to allow schools that already have competitive grants of multiyear tenure to complete those grants. At the end it will rise to $5 billion. It should come out to about $100 per student in every school--and turn the job back to the local schools, the parents, the teachers, the school board members, the administrators.There are those who oppose this approach. They argue that we need even more Federal control. But as I said at the beginning, while it is a national priority, education must be returned to the local school districts as a local responsibility, to empower the people who know the names of the kids, their problems, their challenges, and their opportunities, to make the decision.Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold. Let's let local schools do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement. Ask your teachers, your principals, your superintendents, your school board members; and then I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation that Senator Ashcroft and I are introducing today.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and common questions about the direct check for education bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:08:52.871479,2015-03-17 19:08:52.871479,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1999-01-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-01-19/html/CREC-1999-01-19-pt1-PgS345-2.htm,8,158,145,S345-S470,B000611,mr. bond

His education included the St. John High School Seminary in Kansas City, St Louis' Preparatory Seminary and the Theological College of Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. On May 31, 1945, he was ordained a priest. In 1954, he earned a doctorate in Sacred Theology.He served many parishes and education assignments. One of these assignments was superintendent of the diocesan schools in the Kansas City area. On July 2, 1969, Pope Paul VI appointed McAuliffe as the second Bishop of Jefferson City. He served in this position for 28 years. During his tenure, he had an active interest in parochial education. Approximately 13 years ago, he started the Diocesan Excellence in Education Fund.McAuliffe retired in 1995, at age 75, but remained the bishop until Pope John Paul II appointed the current bishop in 1997.Mr. Speaker, the Most Reverend Bishop Michael McAuliffe was a valuable leader in both the church and his community.

But the majority does not stop with just broken promises.Their budget eliminates funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools, eliminates funding for vocational education, eliminates programs that help ensure high-risk students can attend college, and eliminates 36 programs that help teachers and students succeed.

Cheryl has enjoyed a successful banking career spanning 28 years and has been chosen to receive the YWCA Women of Excellence Award for Women in the Workplace.Cheryl truly built her career from the ground up. At the age of 22, Cheryl already had a family to support, yet she had little education and experience. She took the initiative and obtained her General Education Degree. She then took her first job working as a bookkeeper, while she began taking college classes at night. In 1990, Cheryl graduated Summa Cum Laude from Missouri Western State College with a degree in Business Administration.As a member of the community, Cheryl has been a major advocate of the ``Profit in Education'' program. She has audited books for several Parents and Teachers Association's in the area, and served on the boards of Band Boosters and The Coalition for Achievement. Currently, she serves on the Clarence J. Carpenter Memorial Fund Board and is very active in the Pony Express Chapter of the American Business Women's Association.Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Cheryl Hale. Her commitment to education, business, and the community are truly remarkable. I am honored to represent her in the United States Congress.,2015-03-17 19:08:55.048028,2015-03-17 19:08:55.048028,Extensions,RECOGNIZING CHERYL HALE,2006-07-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-07-27/html/CREC-2006-07-27-pt1-PgE1560.htm,101,0,152,E1560,G000546,mr. graves

2077,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the ``Teachers of the Year'' selected in the Second Congressional District of Missouri for their outstanding efforts to educate our children.A quality education is critical to a child's future. Without good education, a child has no future. Together with parenting and faith, education literally defines a child's future. Among all school-based factors, teacher quality is the most important; that some teachers are much more effective than others with similar students; and that teacher quality may specially affect the achievement of disadvantaged students.The teachers I rise to commend here today are individuals who have made and are making a difference in the lives of children and in their communities. Quality teachers provide experience, patience, diligence and understanding to the classroom.In conjunction with National Teacher Appreciation Day, I would like to commend the following teachers who have been recognized by their colleagues for their contributions to education.Michele Cash, Becky Henkey, Donna McCarrison, Bev Lamunion, Kim Nelson, Molly Hamer, Luanne Heggs, Dave Spies, Vicki Readenour, Michelle Dawson, Dusty Wall, Sandi Lauer, Brenda Kaiser, Sharon O'Donnell, Ray Zahra, Mary Duchek, and Sue Frain.,2015-03-17 19:08:56.156837,2015-03-17 19:08:56.156837,Extensions,MISSOURI TEACHERS OF THE YEAR,2001-05-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-08/html/CREC-2001-05-08-pt1-PgE757-2.htm,62,0,147,E757,A000358,mr. akin
2078,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey). At a time when public schools are struggling to rebuild antiquated and crumbling school facilities and deal with a record enrollment of over 52 million students, we should not be considering proposals that divert scarce taxpayer dollars from our public school systems to subsidize private and religious schools.While school vouchers may benefit a small minority of children who have the option of attending a private or parochial school, school vouchers will ultimately condemn the vast majority of our children to an inferior education as a result of the shift in tax dollars from public education to private.This voucher proposal provides a select few a way out of the public school system while abandoning the vast majority of our children to underfunded and overcrowded schools. The hardest hit will be low-income, inner-city children who are already suffering from a lack of quality educational opportunity.Rather than defunding public schools, we need to be reinvesting in public schools. Our children's future success in the Information Age will depend on their ability to receive a quality education, and school vouchers are a nonanswer to that challenge.School vouchers are an attack against public education and an attack against our children. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote against this amendment.,2015-03-17 19:08:56.292906,2015-03-17 19:08:56.292906,House,NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001,2001-05-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-23/html/CREC-2001-05-23-pt1-PgH2590-2.htm,72,23,147,H2590-H2611,C001049,mr. clay
2079,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, we are here today taking a step toward revising the tax system and revising the tax philosophy that has too long been headed in the other direction. We are here today to decide that American families can spend their money better than the Government can spend their money.The only bad news in the bill for working families today is it is going to be 6 months before they begin to see what really happens when they have their money back instead of the Government having that money.A $500-per-child tax credit means to a family of three, a working family of three, $125 every month that the Government has been spending that they can now start spending next year. It is going to make a difference.This bill will make a difference as we work to make education more affordable. Vocational education, college education, $5,000 in tax credits over 4 years of college; tax savings accounts, education savings accounts that are going to be tax free, that allow families to save for college. We will not be taxing the interest on student loans any more.This is a great day for American families, Mr. Speaker.,2015-03-17 19:08:56.437008,2015-03-17 19:08:56.437008,House,TODAY MARKS A START IN REVISING TAX SYSTEM AND TAX PHILOSOPHY IN UNITED STATES,1997-07-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-07-31/html/CREC-1997-07-31-pt1-PgH6622-2.htm,111,1,143,H6622,B000575,mr. blunt

2081,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, it is the thrust of this amendment that if you are on welfare and you have not completed your high school diploma the best way to get a job and keep a job is to achieve a level of education that our society expects of all adults, and that is a high school education.So this amendment would allow States to require individuals to get a high school education or its equivalent. This amendment is permissive, and it states that if you are a 20- to 50-year-old welfare recipient who does not have a high school diploma, you must begin working toward attaining a high school diploma or a GED as a condition of receiving benefits. An exception is made for people who are not capable.Job training will not equip welfare recipients to work if they have not achieved the basic and fundamental proficiency in education skills. How can we expect to train someone to work as a cashier if they cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide?The facts are indisputable. A person over 18 without a high school diploma averages $12,800 in earnings; with a high school diploma, averages $18,700 in earnings. Mr. President, $6,000 is the difference between dependence and independence; between welfare and work.This is permissive to the States.,2015-03-17 19:08:56.704205,2015-03-17 19:08:56.704205,Senate,RECESS,1996-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-23/html/CREC-1996-07-23-pt1-PgS8501.htm,109,54,142,S8501-S8532,A000356,mr. ashcroft

Republicans need a lesson in both.Their failure to support a simple continuing resolution that funds education programs at fiscal year 1995 levels is creating serious problems for schools, teachers and children who have absolutely nothing to do with the budget fight. They are the innocent victims of a drive-by shooting. In this case, it is hard to tell who is driving this car. Is it the Speaker or the 73 Republican freshmen or the Christian coalition?The devastating cut in title I funding will deny 1.1 million needy children the crucial help they need in reading, writing, math, and critical thinking. Drug abuse and violence prevention programs will be cut for millions of students in nearly every school district in the country. Innovative school to work strategies developed at the local level will be halted. Teachers will be fired, classroom sizes will increase.With this continuing resolution, the Republicans are turning their backs on public education.

Student loans have been an essential tool for many students and families who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford the soaring costs of college tuition. However, in a few short weeks, Federal student loan interest rates are set to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent, making the dream of attaining college even more difficult for millions of students and families.We need to act now. It is our responsibility to ensure that all children have the ability to pursue higher education. The cost of attending college has gone up almost 30 percent in the last 10 years. We cannot afford to ignore struggling students across this Nation. In these uncertain economic times, we can make no greater investment than in education. More and more jobs require some sort of post-secondary education, and by 2018, just 6 years from now, 63 percent of employment opportunities will demand an education beyond high school.It is pathological partisanship that is preventing us from dealing with this important issue.,2015-03-17 19:08:57.229573,2015-03-17 19:08:57.229573,House,STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES,2012-06-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-06-07/html/CREC-2012-06-07-pt1-PgH3589-3.htm,85,1,158,H3589,C001061,mr. cleaver

2087,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, the ability of our Nation to provide education and training opportunities to our people is more important now than ever before. Our success in the increasingly competitive global economy will largely depend upon the skills and productivity of our workers. Education and job training programs provide workers with the opportunity to learn and to improve their skills.It is our duty to make certain that those programs are effective and efficient. Many have criticized our current training system for being too duplicative and too sparse. The legislation we consider today will improve the coordination of services, provide quality assistance and foster efficiency.I am especially grateful that this agreement addresses the unique needs of dislocated workers as well as providing for meaningful local decisionmaking. As Members may remember, these issues were among the highest priorities advocated by Democrats during last year's deliberations on the careers bill. With respect to the adult education provisions of this bill, I believe that we have made solid progress. We have made sure that the program remains a part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that it will be administered by the State agency now in charge of adult education, that the program has a reasonable maintenance of effort standard, and that it will continue to serve a critically important role in the education of those who need its services.I want to particularly compliment the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the gentleman from California [Mr. McKeon] for their leadership and for their sincere efforts to make this a bipartisan effort on this bill. I appreciate their willingness to seek resolution of our differences on this issue. I also want to commend my Democratic colleague, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, Training and Life-Long Learning, for picking up where his predecessor, Pat Williams, left off by ensuring that any compromise adequately protects Democratic concerns.Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, be given the authority to control the minority's time during general debate.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. McInnis).

I think this movement forward is helpful. We had frozen vocational education at last year's funding at a time when I think we are working in every possible way to get people to the workplace, people who have not been there before through welfare reform; people who are out of high school or did not get out of high school who need additional training.Vocational education is critically important. I am certainly glad to hear both the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Porter], the chairman, and the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], the ranking member, agree to accept this change to add this money to vocational education.Mr. Chairman, I look forward to this amendment becoming part of the package that the House passes, and then I am hopeful that we will also be committed, realizing what I just heard about the importance of everybody being in agreement, to uphold the House's position and keep this additional $20 million for vocational education in this bill when it comes back to the House from conference.This is an important step, going along with the step that we have already taken in passing the authorization legislation that, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania has pointed out, sets a new standard of money in vocational education that gets to the classroom where students are affected by it.That new standard of 90 percent, essentially under local control and maybe, more importantly, under the control of a local teacher, of the teacher in the classroom, as opposed to 75 percent, is an important standard for us to meet. To add to that some additional funding for vocational education in a program that is critical to the future of the country is going to be a good thing to see.I hope we see it in the final bill as well. I am grateful that the chairman and the ranking member have agreed to be supportive of this amendment and grateful to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Peterson] for not only letting me work with him but for working so hard to put this amendment together.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Barrett of Nebraska).

2089,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President. Last month, I joined a bipartisan group of centrist Senators to support a $1.25 trillion tax cut along with an economic stimulus for this year. The tax cut agreed upon after negotiations with the White House and House of Representatives totals $1.35 trillion. I support a tax cut of this size and think that the people of Missouri also believe it to be a commonsense compromise.This tax cut should provide immediate tax relief to help stimulate the economy, cut personal income taxes for all taxpayers, eliminate the marriage penalty, and eliminate the estate tax for all family farms and family-owned small businesses. I also want to ensure that the tax cut is distributed fairly and responsibly by focusing on the people who need tax relief the most--the working men and women of America.The other key component of the budget voted on by the Senate last month was an approximately $300 billion investment in education over the next decade. That budget plan included sufficient funds to meet the Federal Government's commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education. Meeting this commitment would enable states and localities to spend billions of dollars of their own funds on improving educational quality at the local level. The Senate budget also included funds for student loans, programs for disadvantaged students, and the testing and accountability reforms currently being debated on the Senate floor.Unfortunately, the conference report before us completely eliminated the educational investments contained in the Senate passed budget. Indeed, this conference report does not even fund the education increases contained in President Bush's budget proposal.Not only is this approach to education inconsistent with the bipartisan actions taken on the budget by the Senate a few weeks ago, but it is dramatically at odds with the votes being cast by the Senate on the education reform bill. Last week, the Senate unanimously voted to fully fund the Individual with Disabilities Education Act at a cost of $120 billion over ten years. Earlier this week, the Senate agreed to fully fund the largest federal education program for disadvantaged students at a cost of $130 billion. The vote on that amendment was 79-21.I am a newcomer to the Federal budget process, but it defies common sense to be voting to support major increased investments in education on the one hand, while on the other hand voting for a budget that does not meet these commitments.Some of my colleagues have stated that the lack of education funding in the budget should not be of concern because, eventually, Congress will provide additional support for education during the appropriations process. But I ask, what purpose does a budget serve if we vote based on an intention not to abide by it?So, while I strongly support the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts for the American people contained in the conference report, I cannot support this budget agreement. I look forward to working on the tax cut legislation scheduled for later this month and on the appropriations bills that follow. Hopefully, in the end, we will provide both a tax cut of $1.35 trillion that provides needed tax relief to the public and an investment plan that meets our vital national priorities.,2015-03-17 19:08:57.748941,2015-03-17 19:08:57.748941,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--CONFERENCE REPORT,2001-05-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-10/html/CREC-2001-05-10-pt1-PgS4776-3.htm,64,55,147,S4776-S4794,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2090,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support of H. Con. Res. 266, expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the benefits of music education.Music education has a long history, dating back to Ancient Greece. As part of a standard education, music was used to teach math and deemed equally important to forming a balanced individual. As a former educator, I know that an important component to youth development and a key solution to youth violence is access to art and music education in our schools. College Board studies have shown that students who play an instrument score significantly higher on their Scholastic Aptitude Tests than those who do not. High risk elementary students who participated in an arts program for one year gained eight percentile points on standardized language arts tests. Those who have exposure to music and art are less likely to have discipline problems. If we are serious about improving student achievement and curtailing youth violence in our schools, we must find adequate funding to bring music and art education to our children.Missouri's fifth district has taken major steps toward integrating arts education into the daily routine in schools. Magnet schools such as the Paseo Academy of Visual and Performing Arts and the Kansas City Middle School of the Arts teach children more than just reading, writing, and arithmetic. Students also learn how to create and appreciate music, painting, and dancing through hands-on experience. The Kansas City Symphony established an orchestral residency at the Paseo Academy to provide professional mentors to aspiring musicians. The results of programs like this are astounding. These schools have improved student test scores well above the district average and greatly increased parental satisfaction. Students enjoy attending school more than ever because of personal interest with the subject matter. I urge my distinguished colleagues to support this measure.Because of the vast amount of research proving the benefits of music education, we need to invest in more programs which will spark student interest in music such as the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) sponsored ``Challenge America'' initiative which would provide $50 million to more than 1,100 communities, bringing the arts and music to regions previously underserved by cultural programming.Music and art education remains important in the lives of children. From infants listening to classical music to facilitate brain development, to elementary students learning about music related careers from their favorite musicians, to high school instrument students who achieve above average SAT scores, the importance of music education cannot be denied. I urge my distinguished colleagues to continue to support music and art education programs such as ``Challenge America'' which contribute to the success of students as they become members of our democracy.,2015-03-17 19:08:57.881034,2015-03-17 19:08:57.881034,Extensions,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BENEFITS OF MUSIC EDUCATION,2000-06-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-14/html/CREC-2000-06-14-pt1-PgE1002.htm,74,0,146,E1002,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2091,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, this amendment, as has been read, transfers the increase in OSHA to vocational and adult education. In the last debate I believe I heard the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro] suggest that we need to challenge the House to spend more money on training. This amendment meets that challenge, and may be more timely even because of that challenge, that we spend more of our money on training.I think increasing spending in OSHA, as opposed to increasing spending in vocational and adult education, really just does not make sense to me, so this amendment is to transfer that increase. OSHA would be frozen. OSHA is being studied. There are field hearings on OSHA. There is nobody who is a member of this body who does not believe that OSHA needs to be significantly restructured in the way it does its job.At the same time, vocational and adult education have been incredibly successful programs that are actually funded below the 1997 levels. In a bill that funds programs that are not even authorized, vocational education and adult education are funded below last year's levels. I find that unacceptable.In fact, as we match these two things together, the best place to ensure workplace safety is in training. The best place to prevent accidents is before they happen. The best place to have workers prepare to be safe workers is not on the job, but before they get on the job, and vocational education has a track record of doing that effectively.This transfer would make sense from the training point of view. It freezes OSHA at the 1997 level. With this transfer we actually fund vocational education and adult education above the 1997 level. I urge its passage. I think when we look at the number of people that work in OSHA, the average business that is affected by OSHA really can anticipate a visit maybe as infrequently as once every 10 years. That does not ensure workplace safety.Well-trained workers do ensure workplace safety. Vocational education money and adult education money get people to work who have not been to work before. They increase the skills of those people who have not been to work before.On the other hand, OSHA often encourages people not to create jobs, and there are examples probably in every district represented in this House where people keep their employee numbers below 50 just so they will not have to deal with OSHA. When the OSHA inspector comes, it depends on which part of the OSHA code that inspector is familiar with on how the inspection goes that day. Training, Mr. Chairman, is the key to the workplace. It is the key to workplace safety.Leaving these two programs at levels below 1997 funding in this bill while we increase OSHA funding I think is unacceptable, so this amendment would rectify that situation. I urge its passage, Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN.

2092,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I applaud and salute Dr. Donohue on her tenure as President of the National Council for Occupational Education [NCOE].Dr. Patricia C. Donohue has provided dynamic leadership as the 1995-96 president of the National Council for Occupational Education. During her tenure, she focused on initiating exemplary policies and practices in economic development and workforce preparation for workers in our global economy, The NCOE's members are professionals in community and technical college education who serve as workforce development and occupational education resources for legislators and policymakers from various governmental agencies. NCOE also promotes innovative practices in community and technical colleges and tracks student achievement in these areas.Early in Dr. Donohue's tenure, she convened a strategic planning process which established five critical goals for NCOE for the years 1995-1997.The first goal is to transform education and training programs and structures to better prepare workers for the 21st century. The NCOE-produced monograph Workforce Development defines the need for national policy in this critical area and identifies strategies necessary for progress. NCOE provided copies of Workforce Development to congressional committees, Representatives, and Senators, for use in their important work on new education and workforce training legislation including efforts to streamline dozens of job training and education programs.The second goal emphasizes improving legislative relations by the organization. A National Policy Response Team was implemented for this purpose. Team members made monthly visits to agencies and legislators on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The team provided information to legislators and facilitated communication with practitioners. In addition, the policy response team provided quick responses to congressional and agency requests.The third goal is to collaborate in workforce preparation initiatives. Partnerships have been established with the National Council of Advanced Technology Centers. Network (a Department of Labor project), and the National Council on Community Service and Continuing Education [NCCSCE]. Monographs will be forthcoming from project partnerships with the League for Innovation and the National Center for Research on Vocational Education and also from the joint work with NCCSCE. The National Association for Manufacturing and the National Skill Standards Board are among other partners working with NCOE.The fourth goal established is to inaugurate a leadership development program. Regional training conferences will be established to implement this goal.The fifth goal is that of enhancing operating strategies for member services. In addition to improvements in the organization's newsletter, an Internet electronic Web page has been initiated to provide information and respond to questions.Dr. Donohue also serves on the Commission on Community and Workforce Development of the American Association of Community Colleges [AACC]. She is a coauthor of a Commission Monograph on the community college role in implementing reforms in workforce preparation proposed in Federal legislation.Again, congratulations and best wishes for continued success in your efforts with the National Council for Occupational Education as well as with St. Louis Community College.,2015-03-17 19:08:58.148230,2015-03-17 19:08:58.148230,Extensions,CONGRATULATIONS TO DR.

2093,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, on two separate occasions this year I have made statements about the importance of education to our Nation and to this Congress. I've talked about what our parents want for their children, how to provide a good education, and how many of our current federal policies have failed to achieve what we want for our children.Today, as the Senator from Arkansas introduces his ``Dollars to the Classroom Act,'' which incorporates ingredients for educational success into our federal policy, I want to join in cosponsoring his bill as it will empower states and local school districts to spend federal resources in the best way they see fit. I also want to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of education.A Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall found that 88% of those surveyed think that improving the quality of public school education is ``very important.'' Now, I am not one to put a lot of emphasis on polls, but I think that this poll indicates what we already know: that making sure kids get a world-class education is a real priority for our nation. Moms and dads want their children to be in settings where they will be challenged to reach high levels of academic achievement, taught by qualified and caring teachers, and provided a safe learning environment.Obviously, parents want to be sure that schools are using the ingredients of success in education: parental involvement, local control, an emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance. It is interesting to note that a recent report of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives.Unfortunately, we are continuing to find that many of our current federal education programs, while well-intended, simply do not contain the ingredients of a successful education. Rather than promoting parental involvement, local control, and dollars going to the classroom, many federal programs promote a ``Washington-knows-best'' policy, in which federal bureaucrats decide exactly what education programs should be developed and exactly how every dollar should be spent. Not only are states, schools, teachers, and parents left without much say in how to educate their children, but they are also drained of time and energy complying with all the federal mandates handed down to them.Our current federal education laws bog states down in mountains of paperwork every year. Even though the U.S. Department of Education recently attempted to reduce paperwork burdens, the Department still requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork per year--or the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full-time. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications states must fill out to receive federal education funds each year.While the Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the smallest federal agencies with 4,637 people, state education agencies have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs (full-time equivalents) with federal dollars to administer the myriad federal programs. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally funded employees of state education agencies administering federal education programs as there are U.S. Department of Education employees.It is no wonder that up to 35% of our federal education dollar gets eaten up by bureaucratic and administrative costs. And we should remember this in the context of the fact that only about 7% of all education funding comes from the federal government. As we can see, this small amount of the entire education pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts must spend to administer education programs.I have also spoken in the past about the Ohio study finding that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of its total education funding. And I've also noted that in Florida it takes six times as many state employees to administer federal funds as it does to administer state dollars.Clearly, federal rules and regulations eat up precious dollars and teacher time. We must find a way to change this.I have also highlighted that the problem that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars paid by their parents for education because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. Local schools must come to Washington and plead their case to get back the money the parents of their communities sent to the federal treasury. Who suffers the most from this system? Smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer to get their fair share of the federal dollar.It is also interesting to note that, according to the Department of Education's own estimates, it takes 216 steps and 20 weeks to complete the review process for a federal discretionary education grant. The Department boasts that this is actually a streamlined process, since it used to take 26 weeks and took 487 steps from start to finish!I have talked about a third problem with many current federal education programs: dollars are earmarked for one and only one purpose, to the exclusion of all other uses. And many times, the distant Washington bureaucrats are designating funds for something that a school district doesn't even need at the time.I like to use an analogy to explain this problem. If you feel a headache coming on, would you rather be treated by a doctor one mile away from where you live, or a thousand miles away? And if you have to use the doctor a thousand miles away, how good is he or she going to be at prescribing what you need for your headache? It sure would be nicer to see someone close by who could take a look at you in person and make a proper diagnosis.And what if, when you tell the doctor a thousand miles away that you have a headache, she says to you, ``Oh, that's too bad. But today we're running a special on crutches. We are prescribing crutches for people like you all over the country, because we've heard that you may need them.'' You say, ``That's fine, but how is a crutch going to help my headache? Can't I get the money to buy some aspirin?'' And the doctor says, ``Sorry, but you can only use this money for crutches, not for aspirin, or anything else.''This is exactly what happens with so many of these categorical programs mandated from the federal level. Your local school district has determined that it needs funding for one thing, but the federal government will only release it for another. As a result, schools don't have the flexibility to use their funding for what they know they need to provide the best education possible for their students.For all the federal programs and dollars committed to education, are we seeing success? I'm afraid not.I have heard of a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which noted that even though the United States dedicates one of the largest shares of gross domestic product to education, it has fallen behind other economic powers in high school graduation rates. Only 72 percent of 18-year-old Americans graduated in 1996, trailing all other developed countries.Our Congressional Research Service has explained why current federal aid programs may not lead to educational improvement. They note that these programs have generally been focused on specific student population groups with special needs, priority subject areas, or specific educational concepts or techniques. CRS reports:While such ``categorical'' program structures assure that aid is directed to the priority population or purpose, they may not always be effective--instruction may become fragmented and poorly coordinated; the proliferation of programs may be duplicative; each federally assisted program may affect only a marginal portion of each pupil's instructional time that is poorly coordinated with the remainder of her or his instruction; regulations intended to target aid on particular areas of need may unintentionally limit local ability to engage in comprehensive reforms; or the partial segregation of special needs students, while it helps to guarantee that funds can be clearly associated with each program's intended beneficiaries, may also reinforce tendencies toward tracking pupils by achievement level, and unintentionally contribute to a perpetuation of lower expectations for their performance.I think the Congressional Research Service makes some valid observations about why our current federal education policy is not generally boosting student achievement and making our children competitive with other nations. CRS says that current federal policy hinders an important element of educational success: local control.Based upon what we know about the state of our current federal education policy, we must explore how to direct our resources in ways that will stimulate academic success and high achievement. States, school districts, school boards, teachers, and of course, parents, are asking for local control and flexibility to spend federal education dollars in ways they know will work. They know how to incorporate the ingredients of success into the education of their children.Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will give states and local schools the flexibility that they desperately need. His legislation takes nearly $3.5 billion from a number of federal education programs, directs the money to the states based upon student population, and requires that at least 95% of it is spent in our children's classrooms. Local school districts may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement.Under the ``Dollars to Classroom Act,'' parents, teachers, school boards and administrators will have the freedom to use federal dollars for what they need: whether it be to hire more teachers, raise teacher salaries, strengthen reading programs, buy new computers, or provide more one-on-one tutoring.The bill ensures that federal bureaucracy will be held at bay by forbidding the Secretary of Education from issuing any regulations regarding the type of classroom activities or services that school districts may choose to provide with the federal dollars. Finally, the ``Dollars to Classroom Act'' calls for ways to streamline regulations and eliminate bureaucracy within major federal education laws.Mr. President, we need to ensure that more federal education money is sent to the classroom, and that states, schools, and parents have more flexibility in using those funds in the way that will best help students achieve their fullest potential. We must find ways to encourage states and local schools to be innovative and creative in finding the most successful ways to challenge our students to the highest levels and achievement. Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will help accomplish these goals, and that is why I am pleased to co-sponsor his legislation.During the coming months, Congress should continue to evaluate our current federal elementary and secondary education programs and make the necessary changes to incorporate the ingredients we know have proven successful in providing the best education possible for our children. We cannot afford to maintain the status quo if it is not working. We owe it to our next generation to provide them what they need to be successful in the 21st Century. ,2015-03-17 19:08:58.281319,2015-03-17 19:08:58.281319,Senate,PESTICIDE HARMONIZATION WITH CANADA,1999-02-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-02-09/html/CREC-1999-02-09-pt1-PgS1393.htm,23,9,145,S1393-S1399,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2094,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Madam Chairman, let me begin by thanking the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for working together in a true bipartisan fashion to begin providing a long overdue down payment to special education funding. In particular, I want to thank Ranking Member Walsh for his amendment in committee to provide a $335 million increase in special education funding for fiscal year 2008.When the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was signed into law more than 30 years ago, the Federal Government committed to pay the States 40 percent of the costs of providing services to students covered under this act. However, for three decades the Federal Government has often provided less than half the money promised.What has this shortfall meant? For one, it has meant higher taxes at the State and local levels and less funding for other education programs as States and local governments struggle to make up the shortfall in Federal resources.The amendment I introduce today builds on the bipartisan cooperation of the House Appropriations Committee by providing a further $125 million increase in funding for IDEA part B grants to the States. To pay for my amendment, I offset the cost by reducing a portion of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. My amendment helps us fulfill our commitment to funding special education while also providing a small increase in funding to the Global Fund as was provided last year. I don't take this money from any domestic program. These funds are dedicated to an overseas program, and they still see a $1 million increase over last year.My amendment sets the right priorities for our Nation's children with special needs, and I urge support from all of my colleagues. Again, I would thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on this.Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:08:58.415421,2015-03-17 19:08:58.415421,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008,2007-07-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-07-18/html/CREC-2007-07-18-pt1-PgH8000-3.htm,115,3,153,H8000-H8036,G000546,mr. graves
2095,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time to close, as we have no further speakers.I would say to the gentleman and others, my friends, and I consider them my friends, many of whom are on the committee, I certainly hope that this interest in fiscal discipline remains as we really grapple with these appropriations bills, the challenge that remains ahead of us over the next weeks.Mr. Speaker, the idea is that we want to encourage families to put aside money for their children's education expenses. It was good policy a year ago. It is not good politics, it is just good policy to help those children achieve the American dream. Everybody has talked about their children. My daughter, who is almost 3, one on the way in December, and as we think of providing the best education possible for all of our children, is it not prudent to put aside that money at the earliest possible time, certainly as we see the cost of tuition continue to go up?If Congress fails to act, Mr. Speaker, here are the provisions that we will lose come January 1 of 2011. Instead of the annual contribution limit to an education account being $2,000 a year, it would revert to $500. Instead of expanding these education account benefits to all kids who go to any type of school, we would be simply focused on those of college education and forgetting about those educational expenses for special needs kids or educational expenses for those in kindergarten through elementary school and secondary education.My friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), talked about section 529 plans. The reason we need to make these tax incentives permanent is as we invest into a prepaid tuition plan or section 529 plan, the thrust of that is that those withdrawals that we make in those years that those kids, I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra), that are not college age yet, when they reach college age, if we fail to act, those distributions out of those section 529 plans are going to be taxable and not tax-free. That is certainly a good policy reason why we need to act today to make these incentives long-term.Prepaid tuition plans. Again, as the gentleman from Michigan talked about, he has been a champion of tax-free employer-provided education assistance, not just for graduate education but for undergraduate education, again, trying to provide and enlist as many opportunities for individuals in this country of all ages to better themselves through more education.And certainly the student-interest loan deduction, again, if we fail to act, we will once again put limits on the amount of interest that can be deducted on those burdensome student loans if we fail to act.Again, Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting debate. I would just simply say that if it was good policy as we debated this and voted on it as the House and the President signed it into law 1 year ago, it remains good policy today. We need to provide permanent relief to families who want to help their children achieve the American dream.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of making education more affordable and accessible to our nation's students. HR 5203, however, does not actually benefit the majority of students and families.Education savings accounts were established in 1997 as a tool for families to save money over a period of years for their children's higher education. Congress recognized the growing cost of college and the increasing difficulty families face trying to pay for college, and created these accounts to encourage early savings. Last year's tax cut legislation increased the contribution limit for education savings accounts from $500 to $2,000 and expanded the definition of qualified education expenses that can be paid from an education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary school expenses for public, private, or religious schools.While I support making education more affordable, HR 5203 will allow parents to use these statutorily created education savings accounts--tax free--for almost ANY aspect they consider relevant to their child's education, at any school from kindergarten through college.If parents feel they need a new sport utility vehicle to drive their kids to school; That is OK.If they need a new microwave oven to prepare breakfast for their kids before school; That is OK.If I want to use these funds, tax free, to pay my older son Johnny to tutor my younger son Matthew on the ABCs; That is OK.Mr. Speaker, these examples seem silly for good reason; this bill does nothing to help families or to teach children. We need to focus our national attention on helping needy families, fixing ailing public schools, and leveraging community investment to help parents, teachers and administrators meet the important educational challenges they face in serving the vast majority of our children. In addition, we need to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) passed last year.Our Public schools currently serve approximately 90 percent of students in grades K-12 and face record-breaking enrollments. The NCLB gave parents the choice to transfer their kids from a failing public school to non-failing public school. Recent reports show, however, that very few students are actually able to benefit from this because our schools cannot accommodate any additional children. We should act smarter to devote scarce federal dollars to ensure that all our children receive the education they deserve.Finally, the bill is fiscally irresponsible. Last year's tax cut bill halted our progress in reducing the national debt. Virtually all the projected surpluses that were used to justify last year's bill have now disappeared. Furthermore, enactment of the bill being considered today would further increase the budget deficit that already is occurring as a result of last year's bill.I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the underlying bill. This is not the time to be considering a tax cut that our country cannot afford when there is no assurance that the money will truly benefit all families equally.,2015-03-17 19:08:58.536506,2015-03-17 19:08:58.536506,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE PERMANENCE ACT OF 2002,2002-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-04/html/CREC-2002-09-04-pt1-PgH6022.htm,110,32,148,H6022-H6028,H000948,mr. hulshof
2096,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) for yielding.Mr. Speaker, like others today, I am here to recognize the tremendous contribution that Congressman Goodling has made to this Congress, to this country, and particularly to education.Bill Goodling spent his entire career with a focus on education. As a teacher, as a coach, as a guidance counselor, as a school administrator, and when he was elected to Congress by the people from the 19th district in Pennsylvania, he chose to go on the committee that focused on education.He became the chairman of that committee. He has been a tireless advocate for making public schools better through real reform. He has pursued full funding of IDEA, understanding that the Federal Government needs to first of all keep its word.As a former college president, I particularly appreciate all the chairman has done to substantially increase the Pell Grant funding. And during his leadership of that committee, Pell Grant funding has increased in a way that it has never increased before.There are really too many accomplishments to talk about all of them, certainly the signature piece of legislation, the William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. This legislation gives more flexibility to school districts as they try to meet the needs of children, as they try to do what is best for the children of America.On behalf of America's students, on behalf of America's educators, as the cochairman of the Education Caucus here in the Congress, I just want to thank the chairman for his outstanding record of public service, for his commitment to education, for his great work for the people of Pennsylvania.,2015-03-17 19:08:58.671597,2015-03-17 19:08:58.671597,House,TRIBUTE TO CHAIRMAN GOODLING OF THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE,2000-10-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-03/html/CREC-2000-10-03-pt1-PgH8624.htm,121,2,146,H8624,B000575,mr. blunt
2097,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Moran substitute. I support it because it eliminates many of the harmful riders that the majority has added to the D.C. appropriations bill, including the $7 million to fund tuition vouchers for district students.It is appalling that the majority would blackmail the citizens of this great city into accepting a congressional mandated school voucher program that the District voters overwhelmingly rejected, and is opposed by District school officials.This voucher plan is seriously flawed. First, it does nothing for 97 percent of the District students who would not receive a voucher. We should be helping all 78,000 of the district's children, not draining taxpayer dollars from the public schools for just a lucky few that may benefit from a voucher program. Further, the amount of the voucher would not even pay entry into many private schools, and many of those that would be affordable have limited slots and barriers to admission.The real Republican agenda is to undermine public support for public education, and ultimately close down our neighborhood schools. We saw the real Republican agenda in action when they tried and failed to abolish the Department of Education, attempted to block grant education programs, and worked to slash Federal funding for education. Now, desperate to advance their right wing agenda, they are looking to drain taxpayer dollars out of public schools and into private and religious schools.I call on the majority to stop playing politics with our public schools and join with Democrats to invest more in early childhood education, give relief of our crumbling and overcrowded schools, give Federal support for local school renewal plans, and ensure that we have well-trained teachers.I urge support for this substitute.,2015-03-17 19:08:58.794685,2015-03-17 19:08:58.794685,House,Announcement by the Chairman Pro Tempore,1997-10-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-10-09/html/CREC-1997-10-09-pt1-PgH8796.htm,140,43,143,H8796-H8806,C000488,mr. clay
2098,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell the gentleman from Iowa, if he is still present, that I would have objected if the provision he wants had been in this bill.I, for one, do not agree with the welfare bill that was tried to be passed, that could not come out of the Committee on Agriculture. They stuck it on the reconciliation package, which the President rightfully vetoed. It is nothing but a welfare bill for big farmers. Farmers get $120,000 a year and do not even have to farm under that bill.Mr. Speaker, I did not want to talk about it, but the gentleman brought it up. What I really wanted to talk about is I want the people to know that this bill really is one that I am going to vote for because I see the need for it, but I am going to hold my nose real good when I vote for it, because it smells, it stinks for what it does to education. It is terrible for education.I want to tell everybody that if you think this is bad for education, which my educators say is bad for education, then if the President had signed their reconciliation package, which they called the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, they would have seen the same cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and everything down the line, just like they are cutting education in this. This is a terrible bill, but it is the only thing we have. That is the only reason I am going to be voting for it. It smells to high heaven. It cuts education.It means a lot of my students that are in higher education next year are going to have a tough time returning. It means that a lot of kids going out of high school this year are going to have a terrible time being able to get that education next year. It means that many of my elementary and secondary institutions, schools in my district, are not going to be able to have the funds that they need that they have had in the past for necessary programs under title I. I think this should be corrected. That is why I am going to strongly support the motion to recommit.I ask anybody that is really interested in education to support that motion. I will return now to agriculture and tell again the gentleman from Iowa, yes, I have been told, I will tell you how it goes up here, folks.That bill was not reported out of the Committee on Agriculture because it was a smelly bill, a terrible bill, so they stuck it in the reconciliation.Now they tell me, I just got word today, that next week on Tuesday we are supposed to bring it up in committee and mark it up, a different bill. I just got a copy of it today, but now my staff tells me this evening that this is not the bill we are going to mark up, we are going to have a different one, we are going to have the chairman's mark when we do it, and I will not see that until Tuesday.That is the way they work down here. You do not even have an opportunity to read a bill much before you vote on it or act on it.

2099,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Steve Lukens, Assistant Principal at R.O. Hawkins Junior High School in Jackson, Missouri. Recently, Mr. Lukens announced his retirement after 31 years of distinguished service in Missouri's Public Schools.Mr. Lukens was born on June 23, 1947, to Harry and Ella Lukens in St. Louis, Missouri. Upon graduation from high school he joined the U.S. Navy and served as an air traffic controller from 1967 until 1972. After his honorable discharge, Mr. Lukens pursued a degree in education from Southeast Missouri State University, which is also where he met his future wife, Ellen. Upon graduation from the Southeast Missouri State, he commenced what would be a long and laudable career in education.Mr. Lukens has dedicated his life to public education over the past 31 years. He embarked on his teaching career in the Cape Girardeau, Missouri, public school system, where he served as a language arts teacher for 21 years. Throughout his time in the Cape Girardeau Public Schools, he served in several capacities for many extracurricular activities, including sponsor of the Red Dagger Club and set director for theatric productions. In order to play an active role in the lives of even more students, Mr. Lukens pursued a position in school administration.In 1996, Mr. Lukens accepted a position as Assistant Principal at R.O. Hawkins Junior High School and has served the school in this capacity for the past ten years. During his tenure, Mr. Lukens has overseen several massive construction projects to the school, a growing student population, and the everyday challenges associated with the instruction of adolescents. As the faces change every year in the halls of R.O. Hawkins Junior High, Mr. Lukens' dedication to education and cultivating the leaders of tomorrow remains a constant. To the students of R.O. Hawkins Junior High, Mr. Lukens is more than just a school administrator, he is a friend and mentor.Although Mr. Lukens has led an exemplary career in education, it would not have been possible without the love and support of his family. Mr. Lukens' wonderful wife, Ellen, and two loving children, Jennie and Laura, undoubtedly enhanced his ability to change the lives of area youth. As I commend Mr. Lukens, I also recognize the efforts of his family to further his career. I once again congratulate Mr. Lukens on a successful career in education and wish him well in all his future endeavors.,2015-03-17 19:08:59.085899,2015-03-17 19:08:59.085899,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO STEVE LUKENS,2006-04-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-04-26/html/CREC-2006-04-26-pt1-PgE605-2.htm,47,0,152,E605,E000172,mrs. emerson
2100,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of Fort Osage as a landmark identified and later developed by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the voyage of the Corps of Discovery.In June of 1804, the Corps of Discovery passed a high bluff on the Missouri River--which would later become Fort Osage in Jackson County, Missouri. Only four years later, Clark returned to initiate construction on a Fort and trading-house under the direction of the War Department. Clark noted ``The River could be completely defended'' and he deemed the ``situation elegant.''Fort Osage (or Fort Clark as it was originally named) played an important role in the exploration and development of the West. Goods were traded with the Osage, Ayauway and Kansas tribes at this site for years to come. Fort Osage proved to be the single most profitable trading post of its kind in the United States and the territories. We are indebted to the legacy of the Fort and the people who lived, worked and defended the Fort. Their courage had a profound effect on the evolution of our nation.As part of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration, Jackson County Parks and Recreation is proposing an innovative education center. The education center would showcase artifacts and exhibit the significance of the Missouri River. I believe this education center is a wonderful addition to the commemoration and will help visitors understand the significance of Fort Osage. It is the only site along the trail where Clark returned to develop a facility that fulfilled the goals of President Thomas Jefferson's dream of commerce and development with the west. The significance of Fort Osage is not limited to Lewis and Clark. Both the Yellowstone Expedition and the Long Expedition visited the Fort in 1819. The Long Expedition brought the first steamboat, Western Engineer. Only years later, William Becknell arrived at Fort Osage, using the site as mile marker ``0'' for the Santa Fe trail, again distinguishing the importance of the Fort in relation to commerce in the west.Due to the area's historical significance, the Fort Osage Education Center was proposed as part of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration. The Education Center was recently recognized by the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission as the priority project in Missouri and I am honored to have this historical site in my district. I look forward to the events surrounding the bicentennial commemoration at Fort Osage and in other areas of the 6th District of Missouri. I join the Missouri Bicentennial Commission, the Missouri Department of Conservation and the United States Geological Survey in full support of the proposed Fort Osage Education Center.,2015-03-17 19:08:59.203976,2015-03-17 19:08:59.203976,Extensions,FORT OSAGE,2001-05-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-08/html/CREC-2001-05-08-pt1-PgE751-5.htm,62,0,147,E751-E752,G000546,mr. graves
2101,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and exceptional career in education is nearing an end. Dr. Tom F. Luthy, Jr., of Lebanon, Missouri, is retiring after more than 40 years of service to Lebanon Public Schools.Tom began his teaching career as an 18-year-old college student in 1958 at the Blackfoot School. After that, he taught grades five through eight for two years at the two-room Bolles School before teaching for two years at the Lebanon High School. After a year of teaching at the newly built Glendale High School in Springfield, Tom returned to Lebanon as the school's firstever department chair in charge of the social studies program. He continued to teach history for 15 more years at the high school.When the high school moved to its present location in 1976, Tom stayed as the assistant principal of Lebanon Junior High. Two years later, he became the principal and spent the next 17 years guiding the lives of the young people who attended his school. After that, he became the Lebanon R-111 Schools assistant superintendent for personnel and instruction. As an assistant superintendent for the past eight years, Tom has hired more teachers than are currently on the entire district staff. He also guided the district through its highly successful review under the Missouri School Improvement Plan in 1998.Tom has had a great impact on education in the Lebanon area. Early in his career, he created the American Heritage program at the high school. He also was involved in the formation of the C-5 school and was instrumental in naming that school after Joel E. Barber, who was president of the school board at the Blackfoot School where he began his career. After retirement, Tom will still impact education by continuing his work with the statewide Goals 2000 project, which is developing a new physical education model for Missouri.Mr. Speaker, Tom Luthy's passion for excellence in education has made a difference in the lives of students and teachers. I know all Members of Congress will join me in paying tribute to his outstanding service to the Lebanon education community.,2015-03-17 19:08:59.382110,2015-03-17 19:08:59.382110,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RETIRING ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT DR.

2102,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is offered by those who apparently have no interest in producing a bipartisan Labor-HHS appropriations bill. It is a sad and ironic commentary that many of those who now claim they support additional funding for vocational education are the same people who want to eliminate the Department of Education and the Federal role in education altogether. It should come as no surprise that these born-again devotees of vocational education choose worker health and safety protection as their sacrificial lamb. After all, many of the supporters of this amendment tried in vain last year to pass legislation to gut the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Since they failed to decapitate OSHA with a single blow of the axe, they now apparently have decided to try to kill OSHA cut by cut, dollar by dollar.Mr. Chairman, I will match my support of vocational education against that of any other Member of this House. But I will not support this insulting effort to pit worker safety against vocational education. Seventeen workers are killed on the job every day in this country. A recent comprehensive study of occupational injury and illness found that workplace illnesses and injuries cost this country at least $171 billion a year. Yet, OSHA has only enough inspectors to inspect each workplace for which it is responsible once every 167 years. Six thousand five hundred workers die every year as a result of occupational injuries. Sixty thousand more workers are killed every year as a result of occupational illnesses. The cost of AIDS, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular diseases are less than the cost of occupational death and illness.Mr. Chairman, since 1970 the job fatality rate in this country has been cut in half; since passage of OSHA, at least 140,000 lives have been saved. But we can do better. Let me remind the sponsor of this amendment, my colleague, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Blunt] that 125 workers in the State of Missouri were killed in workplace accidents in 1995. Another 170,000 Missouri workers were injured on the job. There was only enough money to employ 37 OSHA inspectors for our State, and it would take these inspectors 339 years to inspect each workplace one time.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not in the best interests of the health and safety of Missouri workers, as well as millions of other workers across this Nation. I urge defeat of the amendment.,2015-03-17 19:08:59.526210,2015-03-17 19:08:59.526210,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-08/html/CREC-1997-09-08-pt1-PgH6977-5.htm,117,24,143,H6977-H6999,C000488,mr. clay
2103,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, it's a great revelation to see that our colleagues on your side of the aisle have come to realize the importance of increased support for student aid programs which assist low income students. I am especially pleased that, after numerous efforts to slash funding for education programs, Republicans now see the light. My hope is that they will continue moving in that direction and realize that increased funding for education across the board is essential to increase educational opportunities.Mr. Speaker, I support a substantial increase for Pell funding. In fact, in the last Congress I introduced legislation to make Pell Grant funding mandatory spending, just like the loan programs.However, I am concerned that the way H. Con. Res. 88 is written, could be interpreted to pit one group of education programs against another. If adopted and adhered to by the appropriators, it would rob Peter to pay Paul.The record of House Democrats' support for increased aid to needy college students is clear. House Democrats have been in the forefront in advocating increased funding for student aid programs without short-changing or reducing spending for other programs. Since 1996, Democrats, in conjunction with the President, have been responsible for adding nearly $8 billion more for education than was in bills supported by House Republicans. With respect to Pell Grants, since 1996 the President requested, and House Democrats supported, an increase of $3.4 billion, while House Republicans advocated 62% less.Today, we are being asked to vote for a resolution that would aid freshmen at the expense of first graders. We believe that is an unwise, inappropriate choice.During the committee markup my colleagues and I offered amendments to H. Con. Res. 88 designed to increase Pell Grants without jeopardizing other worthy programs. The language we offered was the same language adopted in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. The Senate resolution calls for increased Pell Grants, without pitting one education program against another. Unfortunately, we are not successful in these efforts.We should go on record for increasing our overall investment in education, instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul.,2015-03-17 19:08:59.660307,2015-03-17 19:08:59.660307,House,URGING CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PELL GRANTS,1999-05-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-04/html/CREC-1999-05-04-pt1-PgH2570-2.htm,63,34,145,H2570-H2577,C000488,mr. clay
2104,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,"Mr. President, today I congratulate Dr. Henry 
Givens, Jr. on his retirement and to thank him for his many years of 
leadership and service to the field of education. For over 50 years, 
Dr. Givens has been a champion of higher education and has fought to 
improve the lives of Missouri's students. It is my pleasure to honor 
him today.A native of St. Louis, MO, Dr. Givens attended public schools and 
received his bachelor's degree from Lincoln University, a master's 
degree from the University of Illinois, and his doctorate degree from 
Saint Louis University. Dr. Givens began his career in education as a 
fifth and sixth grade teacher in the Webster Groves School District in 
suburban St. Louis. After his work with the Webster Groves School 
District, Dr. Givens became the principal of the first prototype magnet 
school, Douglas Elementary School in St. Louis, MO. Under Dr. Given's 
guidance, Douglas Elementary faculty debuted revolutionary teaching 
techniques that are now standard classroom practices, helping to 
modernize Missouri's school systems.In 1973, Dr. Givens continued to break new ground when he became the 
first African-American assistant commissioner of education for the 
State of 
Missouri. Dr. Givens spent 5 years in that position before becoming 
president of Harris-Stowe University in 1979. When he first assumed 
leadership, Harris-Stowe State College offered one degree--elementary 
education--and had only one building. During Dr. Givens' 32 years as 
president of Harris-Stowe, the university expanded and upgraded 
facilities, tripled student population, and added 13 new degree 
programs. Dr. Givens' determined leadership shaped Harris-Stowe into 
the outstanding university it is today.In addition to his accomplishments in the field of education, Dr. 
Givens is affiliated with numerous national and local professional and 
social organizations and has received over 125 awards and recognitions 
for his service to his community. President Obama recently appointed 
Dr. Givens to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital 
Finance Advisory Board, and Dr. Givens has served as the chairman of 
the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Statewide Celebration Commission for 
Missouri since its inception in 1986.It is my pleasure to honor Dr. Givens today. His dedicated leadership 
has improved the quality of the educational experience for Missourians. 
He has undoubtedly touched the lives of many and improved the quality 
of the community at large.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and

2105,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam President, I wish to honor Mrs. Jackie McKinsey of Springfield, MO, for her dedication and service to the Ozarks Technical Community College, locally known as OTC. Twenty-four years ago, McKinsey became a founding member of the board of trustees as the school began operations. McKinsey has been a guiding force in OTC's evolution into the dynamic school it is today, providing a wide range of technical, highly sophisticated curricula for post-secondary education for more than 14,000 students. Since 1990, OTC has transitioned into a modern campus with a series of new facilities in Springfield and the construction of a second campus with three additional education centers.McKinsey led the search committee that resulted in the hiring of the current school president, Dr. Hal Higdon, in 2006. She has served in every office on the board of trustees, including chairperson, and has been a tireless advocate for community colleges in Missouri.In fact, Jackie McKinsey has dedicated her life to activism in education. For 12 years she was a member of the Springfield School Board and spent 2 years on the Missouri School Board Association. She also served on the Missouri Special Education Advisory Board for 20 years. In 1996, she was appointed by the Governor to the Missouri Women's Council. Mrs. McKinsey is an experienced mediator and has served as a trained hearing officer in cases between parents of special education students and schools districts.Jackie McKinsey announced her retirement last summer, and the board of trustees honored her with the title of trustee emeritus. McKinsey is the fifth individual to receive this honor, joining other founding trustees Dolores Brooks, Don Clinkenbeard, Frank Farmer, and Don Wessel. This team of Springfieldians gave OTC the steady direction to be a successful open admission, 2-year college dedicated to technical education. Offering students the opportunity to earn a 1-year certificate, a 2-year associate of applied science degree, A.A.S., or an associate of arts degree, A.A., OTC is now widely praised for its professional faculty and diverse curriculum. I wish Jackie McKinsey all the best in this next chapter.Jackie McKinsey has played a major role in that success, and her legacy will continue to impact future generations through the foundations she help put in place at OTC. I wish her the best in her well-deserved retirement. ,2015-03-17 19:08:59.948511,2015-03-17 19:08:59.948511,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2014-09-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-09-11/html/CREC-2014-09-11-pt1-PgS5556.htm,130,0,160,S5556,B000575,mr. blunt
2106,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the first National Jazz Appreciation Month and the importance of music and arts education to America's youth. Jazz Appreciation Month (JAM) is intended to draw the public's attention to the glories of jazz as both a historical and a living treasure by encouraging public and private partnerships focused on arts education. A joint initiative of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Department of Education, the National Association for Music Education, the International Association of Jazz Educators, and the U.S. Department of State, Jazz Appreciation Month will encourage special programs on jazz every April. The Smithsonian's National Museum of National History began to organize Jazz Appreciation Month in 1997 with a presentation to the International Association of Jazz Educators. Modeled after Black History Month, Jazz Appreciation Month is a global celebration of jazz, with events scheduled from Kansas City to Cleveland to South Africa.Known as the mother of swing and the nurturer of Bebop, my district of Kansas City, Missouri is the birthplace of Charlie ``Bird'' Parker, the great alto saxophonist. Because of ``Bird's'' influence, jazz has been a cornerstone of Kansas City culture since the 1930s. A proud reflection of my district's dynamic musical heritage is the American Jazz Museum at 18th and Vine, which tells the story of jazz and its greatest performers through the sights and sounds of the movement. Tomorrow, I will attend an installation ceremony at the American Jazz Museum to dedicate ``Jazz Pantheon,'' a commissioned sculpture by John T. Scott. This project was funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the One-Percent-For-All Program by the City of Kansas City. This sculpture is part of the ongoing revitalization of the historic district of 18th and Vine and manifests the central role of jazz to the metropolitan Kansas City area.In conjunction with Jazz Appreciation Month, the American Jazz Museum has organized two music educational events in my district. On April 25th, middle school students will be celebrating the culmination of this year's Duke Ellington Youth Project. This interdisciplinary program, which combines music, literature, and history will culminate with a music performance and arts exhibition celebrating the history of jazz and will include a reception at the American Jazz Museum for the participants and their families.Jazz Storytelling is a second music educational program organized by the American Jazz Museum. It combines stories about jazz with live instrumental music for children between the ages of three and nine. A unique aspect of the Jazz Storytelling program is the Living Legends Series, which features Kansas City's own jazz legends, such as Myra Taylor, Luqman Hamza, Geneva Price, Eddie Saunders, and Ahmad Alaadlen, who share their amazing stories and the musical magic that made them great.These programs organized by the American Jazz Museum are two of the arts and music education programs in the metropolitan Kansas City area. Jazz Appreciation events are scheduled throughout the country during the month of April. On April 16 in Los Angeles, the Recording Academy screened the recently restored concert film footage of Louis Armstrong in Prague, Dave Brubeck in Australia and the Bud Powell Trio in France. These films were restored as part of the GRAMMY Foundation's Music on Film Preservation Project, which is an ongoing effort to preserve America's music and film heritage. The National Museum of American History will spotlight the history and music of jazz through events such as a Tribute to Ella Fitzgerald by the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra and a public viewing of Louis Armstrong's first horn that he learned to play on while incarcerated as a youngster in New Orleans.The importance of arts and music education to America's youth should not be underestimated. Affording children access to the arts through education yields great dividends to our society. The U.S. Department of Justice found that arts education reduced delinquency in San Antonio by 13%, increased communication skills of Atlanta students by 57%, and improved cooperation skills of Portland youth by 57%. In addition, the College Board has shown that college bound students who are involved in the arts have higher overall SAT scores than other students. Jazz Appreciation Month should serve as a reminder that we should appropriate additional resources for music and arts education programs, as it is America's children who will reap the benefits.Last week, I was privileged to meet Lionel Hampton, one of the living legends of jazz. I am a proud cosponsor of the resolution passed by the House celebrating Lionel Hampton on his 94th birthday. I would like to personally congratulate Lionel on his birthday, and thank him for his dedication to music education. Lionel Hampton is at the forefront of music education, delineated by the naming of the Lionel Hampton School of Music at the University of Idaho, the first school of music named for a jazz musician. Mr. Hampton's devotion to teaching is evident from the thousands of students who have learned from him and the visiting jazz artists, scholars, and educators he has brought to the school. In addition to being a jazz legend and music educator, Lionel Hampton has a strong correlation to Jazz Appreciation Month, as he is one of the many leading figures in jazz who celebrate their birthday during April.Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month and the ongoing arts and music education events at the American Jazz Museum at 18th and Vine in Kansas City, Congress should commit federal resources to the provision of arts and music education programs for our youth all over America.,2015-03-17 19:09:00.092606,2015-03-17 19:09:00.092606,Extensions,JAZZ APPRECIATION MONTH,2002-04-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-26/html/CREC-2002-04-26-pt1-PgE641-3.htm,49,0,148,E641-E642,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2107,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, on many occasions, I have come to the Senate floor to talk about the importance of parental control and involvement in a child's education. Study after study has confirmed that parental involvement is the single most important element in educational achievement.One way to allow parents more control over and involvement in their children's education is to give them more choices of where to send their children to school. Choice empowers parents. It puts them in the driver's seat instead of the nickel seats. I believe we want parents in those front seats. Education is an important tool that our children need in order to survive and be successful in our society. It is sad to realize that for too many children in too many families, a safe, structured and challenging education is out of reach. The public schools in many of our major cities simply cannot or do not provide adequate education, while a private or parochial education is too costly for most families of modest means.On the other hand, it is encouraging when individuals in our society step forward to provide the means for better educational opportunities for our nation's underprivileged children. When those in the private sector, through their charitable giving, open the door for kids to receive a high quality education, those individuals are to be commended.I am pleased to say that last week, two very generous and compassionate Americans gave new hope to thousands of families across the country who want the same thing all of us want--the best possible education for their children.Ted Forstmann and John Walton are businessmen, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. On June 9, they launched the Children's Scholarship Fund, which will provide scholarships to bright and deserving children from low-income families across the nation to help their parents send them to any private or parochial school they're academically qualified to attend--from kindergarten right through high school. Thanks to these individuals, new educational opportunities will now be available to thousands of youngsters that were not available before.These two civic-minded Americans have given the fund quite a start, with an initial contribution of $100 million dollars. Over the summer, they will select cities to become partners with the fund, lining up donors in each city to match their initial generosity. That will allow this new and exciting program to distribute more than $200 million in scholarships in more than a dozen cities, with each scholarship being an opportunity for a child to prepare for a better and brighter future.This national program is modeled after--and really inspired by--an effort Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton launched here in the city of Washington, D.C. earlier this year. Together they donated $6 million to the Washington Scholarship Fund, which recently awarded scholarships to more than 1,000 students from the troubled District of Columbia public schools. Washington is one of about thirty privately-funded scholarship programs in the country. The fact that there are so many of these programs speaks volumes, I think, about the state of the public schools in many of our cities.I mention the Washington program because I think it's a good example of what the national effort is all about. First, the Washington Scholarship Fund is locally-based and locally-run. Mr. Forstmann is right when he insists that each program must have strong involvement from local officials, community leaders, local businesses and anyone else who wants to help kids obtain the best education. I have always believed that local neighborhoods and communities are in the best position to create solutions to meet the specific needs of individuals in their communities.The Children's Scholarship Fund is already in contact with more than 300 mayors from all around the country. This is the first step in selecting partners who know what's needed in their community and who will support this program financially and with their hard work.But perhaps more important than the scholarships themselves is what they represent. it's important--and maybe even a bit sad--to note that more than seventy-five hundred families here in the Nation's Capitol applied for those 1,000 scholarships. It took a lottery to give them out. Mr. Forstmann has said he never dreamed the demand would be so overwhelming.Who are these families? They're families whose children are trapped in public school systems that offer them no choices. If students only have one choice of where to attend school, they are locked into that school and don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere.On the other hand, when students have more choices of where to attend school, they will have the ability to receive a higher quality, more rigorous education. The Children's Scholarship Fund provides children and their families with more educational choice.I believe that providing more educational choices for families can even help our nation's public schools, because they will understand they are no longer the exclusive provider of education in their community. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what it is that students need. When you have diversity and pluralism in a school system by providing more choices for students, this creates energy, creativity, and quality when institutions know that they have to do their best for to compete for students.I commend Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton for providing the opportunity for our nation's children to have greater choices of where to receive their education, giving them the chance to learn as much as their minds and hard work will allow.Education is an investment in future citizens, future leaders, the future work force of America.

2111,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, the quality classrooms amendment provides flexibility for our schools. I am delighted that the Senate has recognized the need to provide our schools with more choices, not more mandates. The amendment allows for the hiring of teaching specialists, the development of alternative educational programs, and year-round school schedules. It will recognize, reward, and encourage promising reform efforts.I thank the managers for their assistance with the quality classrooms amendment. I greatly appreciate the suggestions that Senator Jeffords and his staff have offered. I am also grateful to Senator Kennedy and his staff for their assistance and for their hard work throughout the education debate. I am proud to be a part of this debate.I am confident that our efforts in behalf of public education will bring greater opportunity to our Nation's children.I understand that the managers have agreed to accept the amendment.,2015-03-17 19:09:00.804119,2015-03-17 19:09:00.804119,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--Continued,2001-05-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-15/html/CREC-2001-05-15-pt1-PgS4913-2.htm,66,105,147,S4913-S4932,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2112,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my colleagues to vote no on this rule and to give every child the first-rate public education that he or she deserves. I believe, and I think most Members believe, that education is the challenge of our time. And after the early promise of a bipartisan accord on education, before getting sidetracked by a partisan tax cut bill, we are on the floor with probably the first truly bipartisan effort of the Bush administration. I congratulate the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) and the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) on bringing this truly bipartisan bill to fruition.This, in our view, is real compromise. It is real bipartisan legislation. It is the product of two sides coming together for the sake of something larger. Democrats did not get everything that we wanted. Republicans did not get everything that they wanted. But both sides were able to forge agreement on more accountability, better-trained teachers, high-quality teachers, and after-school programs which we know make schools safer.That is why Democrats are deeply disappointed with the rule that the Republicans have put forward today. This rule prevents us from offering amendments that we believe are critical to an excellent public education in the Information Age. It squelches debate on the most important issue that we know, preventing us from bringing two key amendments; to modernize public schools and help get smaller class sizes for our children.Something clearly happened between the goodwill in committee and bringing this bill to the floor. Instead of building on what was an honest compromise in the committee, the Republican leadership has backed away from the promise of education reform and opening the door to reducing resources for after-school and other critical programs. It has opened the door to undoing school accountability, an issue where the President and all of us on the Democratic side agree. And it is revisiting the flawed voucher scheme that will not turn around failing schools, will leave children behind, and that Members of both parties have rejected.Now, we need to improve public education for children by building new schools and repairing school buildings, something that both Democrats and Republicans have proposed. By ensuring smaller class sizes, by hiring new teachers, by providing new resources, not less, we live up to the true promise of education reform that truly would leave no child behind.We believe with all our hearts that bipartisan amendments on building new schools, on repairing and refurbishing schools and allowing for smaller classroom size would command bipartisan majorities in this House today and next week when we take up this bill.We ask Members to turn down this rule and give us a rule that will yield a real, real bipartisan education bill for the American people.,2015-03-17 19:09:00.937207,2015-03-17 19:09:00.937207,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1, NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001,2001-05-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-17/html/CREC-2001-05-17-pt1-PgH2298-2.htm,68,35,147,H2298-H2310,G000132,mr. gephardt
2113,MO,James,Talent,R,I rise today in strong support of the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago Congress made a promise to children and families with special education needs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. Under IDEA the Federal Government promised to provide children with disabilities access to quality public education, as well as to contribute 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure to assist state and local schools with the additional cost of educating these students. Mr. Speaker, to date the Federal Government has failed to meet this commitment to assist the states and local school districts.During the past four fiscal years the Republican majority in Congress has increased Federal funding for IDEA by 115 percent or $2.6 billion. Sadly, even with the increase, the Federal Government has never contributed more than 12.6 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure the assist children with disabilities. That is less than \1/3\ of the funding Congress promised under IDEA.The Congressional Research Service estimates that more than $15 billion would be needed to fully fund the Federal portion of IDEA. In fiscal year 2000 IDEA received $4.9 billion, leaving states and school districts with an unfunded mandate of more than $10 billion. This is $10 billion dollars that states and local school districts could have spent on smaller class size, school construction, new computer equipment, and hiring new teachers; instead this money is being spent to cover the Federal share of IDEA. What does that mean for the State of Missouri, Mr. Speaker? The additional funds needed to meet the commitment to the State of Missouri is over $161 million this year. What does that mean for St. Louis? The additional funds needed to meet the commitment to St. Louis is over $8 million this year.Mr. Speaker, it is essential that Congress fully fund IDEA and this legislation is a step in the right direction. This legislation authorizes an increase of $2 billion per year to meet the Federal commitment of 40 percent by the year 2010. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago the Federal Government placed a mandate on our state and local school districts to provide education for all special needs and disabled students. The Federal Government also promised to pay 40 percent of the average cost of the average per pupil expenditure. Today, there is a lot of talk about new education programs and new education initiatives but we still have yet to meet the Federal commitment to IDEA. IDEA is the mother of all unfunded mandates. Local schools are required by Federal law to meet the special education needs of our Nation's IDEA students. It is time that Congress gives our schools the resources that were promised to provide all children with disabilities a quality education.,2015-03-17 19:09:01.071331,2015-03-17 19:09:01.071331,House,IDEA FULL FUNDING ACT OF 2000,2000-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-03/html/CREC-2000-05-03-pt1-PgH2449-2.htm,53,51,146,H2449-H2457,T000024,mr. talent
2114,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Yesterday was President Harry S. Truman's birthday. One of his quotes is particularly appropriate today. He said:The purpose of our society is to enable the individual to attain the highest achievement of which he is capable.The highest achievements that have sprung from our education system have included harnessing the atom, claiming the high ground in space, and curing previously fatal diseases. But now, because of our failure to adequately fund education, tuition is skyrocketing. Graduates who wish to reach for achievement are anchored to Earth by thousands of dollars in debt. For us to also allow interest rates to double on these student loans is morally unacceptable and economically foolish.To paraphrase President Truman: the extra bucks stop here. Let's stop the student loan interest rates from doubling July 1. Stop the political games. Let's support American students to attain their highest achievements.,2015-03-17 19:09:01.270449,2015-03-17 19:09:01.270449,House,STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES,2012-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-05-09/html/CREC-2012-05-09-pt1-PgH2457-11.htm,65,1,158,H2457-H2458,C001060,mr. carnahan
2115,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.Mr. Speaker, tonight we look back nearly a half century to the 1954 case to Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka and the impact on this Nation.The Supreme Court took a bold step at that time to right the wrongs and correct years of injustice. The court stepped out of the box to do what was right. Even so, in Missouri the city of St. Louis and county schools continued to defy the high Court as a large segment of children continued to attend segregated schools and receive an inferior education. Regrettably, it took a local court case in the 1970s to desegregate St. Louis city and county public schools.On a personal note, my family was subjected to the sordid history of segregated schools. My grandmother, Luella Hyatt, was born in suburban Black Jack, Missouri, in the early 1900s and was denied access to schools there. She was forced to move to St. Louis City to attend school with other African Americans.Segregated schools were tragic and the ramifications of children receiving an inferior education put them at an economic and social disadvantage, from their receiving outdated hand-me-down books from white children, to their lowly social standing overall.It cannot be said enough that children of color suffer greatly. In that context Brown v. Board of Education was a remedy to right a grievous wrong.Today as we look back and then turn again towards the future, I am dismayed. I am not dismayed at how Americans have continued to undo past wrongs. Nor am I dismayed at the shoulders on which I stand and what they tried to accomplish. Integration in the context of their times had its merits. What dismays me is that any lessons we can learn from the past appear to be lost on this generation of leaders. And for that I feel we must find a fix.In retrospect, a lot of things have happened in education since the 1950s. The nobility of true integration was not accomplished and a new form of segregation has taken the place of the old. Yet, while Brown v. Board of Education was certainly about education, it was about much more. It was part of a long chain of events which each successive generation took a turn to right wrong and chip away at racism and segregation. Now it is our turn to try and attain that elusive ideal of one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.I am a product of public school. I have always been in support of public education. A public education has served my wife, Ivy, and I, as well as my daughter, Carol, who also attends a public elementary school in the city of St. Louis; and, in fact, her school, Kennard Classical Junior Academy, was one of 15 schools in the State of Missouri recently given the distinction of a gold star status. So not all public education is problematic.Both St. Louis and Missouri have a lot of relevant educational history. For example, the St. Louis public schools opened the Nation's first kindergarten. And in the 1840s it was illegal for African Americans to read and write. First Baptist Church Pastor John Berry Meachum took matters into his own hands. Mr. Meachum opened the Freedom School on a barge in the Mississippi River which was Federally owned and thus out of the reach of State law. And at the college level, a 1938 Missouri case, Missouri ex rel Gaines v. Canada, found that the University of Missouri by denying a black student administrations to its law school, though it did create a separate black law school in a building housing a movie theater and a hotel, created an unfair privilege for white students that did not extend to similarly qualified African American students.Mr. Speaker, like a strait jacket, segregation debilitated this Nation for generations. But the victory of Brown v. Board of Education was not happenstance. It was the result of a well-thought-out strategy by a progressive people trying to build a progressive Nation. Comprised of a combination of five lawsuits from around the Nation, Brown v. Board was argued using expert witnesses to show the psychological and sociological damage of inferiority done to black children as a result of segregation.Convinced separate but equal violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the high Court would ban segregation in public schools. As we all know, desegregation was not immediate, easy, nor complete. In a separate decision known as Brown II in 1955, the Court set desegregation guidelines. But without deadlines, only the infamous ``with all deliberate speed'' in the opinion, segregation lingered and segregationist met integration with violence and hatred. With integration, some whites fled to the suburbs creating de facto segregation in urban schools. And as the urban core deteriorated by the outflow of population and businesses, the urban schools have essentially become second class schools, separate and unequal, despite the law.In closing, I want to thank the leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus for scheduling this time to mark the anniversary of a major milestone. Certainly the shortcomings of the last half century were no fault of Brown v. Board of Education. Certainly it was not the children who dutifully woke up every morning and attended classes in schools provided by governments throughout this Nation. And most certainly it is not the poor and economically impoverished Americans trying to feed those children every day and trusting that one day their lives would be better for them and their children.The children have not failed. Those in government who build, staff and fund this Nation's schools have collectively failed the children. When government officials spend more to incarcerate than to educate, it sends the wrong message to our youths. When government blames the victims of racism, economic oppression, and cultural bias and punishes them through denial, sanctions and promises left unfilled, then there is no wonder the youth of this Nation have rebelled en masse against education, a law-abiding life-style, and unfulfilled promises. Such reality today is as important as Brown v. Board of Education was to this Nation then.The abiding purpose of government is to promote stability in our communities and to care for those who cannot care for themselves. The rich will always take care of themselves and many send their children to private schools run by people they have a voice in choosing and in facilities they help build. The common everyday citizen lacks that luxury. With many of our public school systems in disarray, teachers spending more time trying to maintain order and not teach, for millions of American children the future is not bright. Again, it is not because of Brown v. Board of Education; rather, it is systemic failure of government to care about educating our children.God forbid that another generation of Americans indigenous to this Nation remain undereducated, underserved and in poverty. That was the real point, the real goal of Brown v. Board of Education. And that age-old dream of future generations of equally educated American children building a Nation capable of overcoming the burden of a segregated divisive America has yet to come true.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.,2015-03-17 19:09:01.471616,2015-03-17 19:09:01.471616,House,COMMEMORATING THE 49TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V.

2116,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 17 Northwest Missouri school districts that have been recognized as ``most-improved'' by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. This recognition highlights the outstanding commitment Northwest Missouri has made to ensure that no child is left behind.Since 1998, Missouri has administered the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) tests yearly to measure a student's achievement. The mathematics assessment is given to fourth, seventh, and 10th graders. A communications arts assessment is given to third, seventh, and 11th graders, a science assessment is given to third, seventh, and 10th graders and a social studies assessment is given to the fourth, eighth, and 11th grades. A health/physical education assessment is given to fifth and ninth graders as well. These important tests help Missouri's schools identify both strong and weak academic areas. Most importantly, the MAP tests illustrate the progress Northwest Missouri's school districts have made in providing students with the best available education.I would like to acknowledge the Saint Joseph school district, which appeared four times on the ``most improved top ten'' list. These schools are Hall Elementary, Webster Elementary (appeared twice), and Lafayette High School. Barry School, in Platte County, appeared three times on the top ten list, and Nodaway County placed four of its schools on the list.Other Northwest Missouri schools appearing on the most improved list include Chillicothe High School, Penney High School, Pickering Elementary School, Tri-County High School, West Platte High School, Craig High School, Fairfax Elementary School, North Harrison High School, Northeast Nodaway High School, Pattonsburg High School, Savannah High School, Smithville High School, South Nodaway High School, Southwest High School, Stanberry Elementary, Tri-County Elementary, West Nordaway High School, and West Nodaway Elementary.Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the above schools for their ongoing efforts to strengthen education and the hardworking students who demonstrated their knowledge. I am confident these schools will continue to successfully meet their educational goals.,2015-03-17 19:09:01.615689,2015-03-17 19:09:01.615689,Extensions,CONGRATULATING 17 NORTHWEST MISSOURI SCHOOL DISTRICTS,2002-04-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-29/html/CREC-2002-04-29-pt1-PgE651-3.htm,50,0,148,E651-E652,G000546,mr. graves

2118,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Chairman, I thank the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. I think the fundamental point here is that no school district has to lose money or will lose money under this bill. This is not about school districts losing money. This is about bureaucrats in Washington losing money. This is about bureaucrats at the State level losing money. This is not about school districts losing money.Those people who say this money is going to go from one school district to another are not reading the bill the way the bill has to be read. This is the difference in whether 95 cents out of every education dollar gets to the classroom, or 65 cents out of every education dollar gets to the classroom.This is clearly not something that people who are in favor of the bureaucracy growing would want to be for. It is clearly something that people who are for money being spent in classrooms, on teachers, on education should be for. This is about a teacher who knows every student's name having more to say about how the money is spent. This is about districts that now may not qualify for all 31 of these different grant programs, but is a district that gets to qualify for money, they get to use the money in the way that they understand is best for their district.Even the opponents of this bill concede that the Federal impact they say is minimal. Well, the minimal impact is not what does the job. What does the job is making education work. It is involving families more in the process. It is involving teachers more in the process. It is involving the local building administrator in the process. It is figuring out what can be done for those kids at that school on that day with 95 percent of this money.,2015-03-17 19:09:01.892886,2015-03-17 19:09:01.892886,House,DOLLARS TO THE CLASSROOM ACT,1998-09-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-09-18/html/CREC-1998-09-18-pt1-PgH8037-7.htm,125,43,144,H8037-H8072,B000575,mr. blunt

2120,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for his hard work and the good work he has done on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. This has been a task of assembling the right components that were acceptable to a broad range of interests and reflecting the capacity of States and local communities to make good decisions. I think the Senator has done an outstanding job. I am pleased to have the privilege of being a cosponsor of this bill.Under this legislation, the State of Missouri, my own State, as well as every other State in the Nation, will no longer have to come to Washington on a piecemeal, case-by-case basis to ask for relief from a myriad of Federal education statutes and regulations. Instead, Missouri will have the authority to waive regulations that hinder our schools from providing an excellent education for our students.Now, I know that the occupant of the Chair is a former Governor and had a lot of involvement with individuals in the education effort which is focused at the State level. I remember those days well from my time as Governor. It is most satisfying to try to do something to advance the performance of students. We understand that when students perform well and have great skills, it elevates the potential they enjoy for the rest of their lives.It was always a tremendous matter of concern to me--and I am sure to the occupant of the Chair--how Federal administrative burdens impeded the efforts of States rather than accelerated their capacity to help students perform. I think most Governors and former Governors we talked to would agree that Federal mandates and requirements associated with Federal programs can hinder a State's flexibility and, as a result, they cut into the dollars that could be spent on students. They end up being spent on bureaucracy--not just bureaucracy here in Washington, but a corresponding bureaucracy to deal with the Washington bureaucracy that has to be established and maintained in the States.In response to the question of whether we should impose Federal education standards from Washington, Governor Whitman of New Jersey said, and I think she said it well,What you see now is a huge waste of money on bureaucracy. The more government strings that are on these dollars, the more difficult it becomes to deliver education. If the money that the Federal Government now puts out is too finite and it says you can only spend it for this or for that, that money won't go toward helping students learn, and that's what we want.I agree with the entirety of the statement--``helping students learn, and that's what we want''--and the last line should be the motivation for every one of us not only in the Senate but across America. I simply couldn't agree with Governor Whitman more.States and local schools need more flexibility in how to spend education dollars, to spend them in ways that will help students learn. They are in the best position to make decisions about the education of students. I have to believe that being on site adds value to one's capacity to make an accurate diagnosis or assessment of what is needed.I appreciate the opportunity to speak regarding the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, which will provide States and local schools with the kind of flexibility they need to improve education and to elevate student performance.One of our Nation's highest priorities is to ensure that our children receive the kind of challenging and rigorous education that will prepare them for success. By building a strong educational foundation that focuses on the concept of high academic excellence, we will prepare students to make important career decisions and to become lifelong learners. The habit of education should extend beyond school. As a result, their lives will be enriched.We in Congress should develop and support Federal policies that will promote the best education practices in our States and local schools. We have learned from reports and studies that successful schools and successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement in the education of their children. They are characterized by parental involvement and local control, and they emphasize basic academics and make resources available to the classroom. These are the ingredients needed to elevate educational performance.It is with this in mind that we should stop and ask ourselves whether the current Federal education laws contain the elements that further our goal of giving our kids a world-class education. The unfortunate answer to that question is, our current laws don't do that; the answer is no. A number of our Federal education programs contain a plethora of regulations and restrictions that hinder States and local schools, hinder their ability to tailor and design what is needed in the local circumstance to advance the opportunity for students to learn. Whenever they hinder and obstruct that opportunity to tailor and design the right system, they waste the education dollars.Frequently, education dollars that Washington directs in terms of how to spend them are wasted because the how-to doesn't meet the need of the students and the school district.While the Federal Government has played an important but limited role in providing funding for education, it has also played a conflicting role by attaching so many conditions and strings to Federal dollars that it costs States and local schools a lot of time and resources to comply with all the rules and regulations.We have heard much about the paperwork burdens created by the Federal education rules and regulations. The Federal Department of Education requires States and school districts to complete over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This is a statistic that is mind boggling. That translates into the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time just to do the paperwork for States to get their own money back to educate the students, which the State cares enough about to work hard to make sure that they are trying to elevate the students' performance.We heard that in Florida it takes 374 employees to administer $8 billion in State funds, while it takes 297 State employees to oversee $1 billion in Federal funds--6 times as many per dollar. So that to do the paperwork and create the paper trail and all the paper involvement, to be a recipient of Federal funds, it takes six times as many employees as it does to follow a dollar of State funding in Florida.We know it takes a school nearly 20 weeks, 216 steps, to complete a discretionary grant process within the Department of Education. The Department has boasted that it has streamlined the process, because it used to take 26 weeks and 487 steps from start to finish; now it is only 216 steps in the bureaucratic jungle. With this bureaucratic maze, it is no wonder we lose about 35 cents out of every Federal education dollar before it reaches the classroom.If I were to give my children a dollar and, before I got it from my hand to their hand, I took 35 cents out of the dollar, they would know the difference. We tell ourselves that we are doing great things for education, but before the dollar reaches the student, 35 cents is taken out of the dollar. They know the difference. The difference is felt. And then sometimes we are telling them it has to be spent in a way that doesn't elevate student performance.Current Federal laws, of course, can also be inflexible, requiring the Federal education dollar to be spent only for a narrow purpose, to the exclusion of all others. This type of inflexibility hurts schools that have needs other than the ones prescribed by the Federal Government. A recent example was the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for the early elementary grades. What a noble aspiration. But it wasn't what a number of schools needed. Governor Gray Davis of California recently described how the inflexibility of this initiative is hindering his State's ability to direct Federal funds to areas where they are most needed. Governor Davis said:We need to have the flexibility to apply those resources where we think they could best be used.He went on to say:For example, I was just with Secretary Riley, our U.S. Secretary of Education, for 2 days last week in California. And Secretary Riley was telling me about the $1.2 billion that was appropriated to reduce class size to 18 in the first 3 grades. Now, in California, we are already down to 20 students per class size in K through four. So that money, which is supposed to be earmarked to the area where we have pretty much achieved the goal, would best serve our needs by reducing class size in math and English at the tenth grade level, because we have just started to use a high school graduation exam.Here is a State wanting to elevate the performance of students, with a massive Federal program directed at an area where they have already addressed the problem, but it is ineligible to be used in an area where they need help. We should really understand this. That is why we are proposing in this Ed-Flex program a massive new capacity on the part of States to use money where it is needed, to use money to help get the dollar all the way to the student, and not take 35 cents out of the dollar when it is on its way from the folks in Washington to the classroom where the student studies.Another example is found in title I, which authorizes aid for the education of disadvantaged children. Some of the rigid standards in this program can result in a school losing its ability to provide intensive services to students on a schoolwide basis because it fails by 1 percentage point to have the requisite number of children below a certain income level. Such policies fly in the face of one ingredient for educational success, one vital ingredient: local control.Fortunately, there is a current Federal policy that has helped provide more flexibility and relieve States of regulatory burdens that are associated with otherwise inflexible education dollars. Under the Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, the Department of Education has delegated its authority to 12 participating States to grant individual school districts waivers from certain Federal requirements that hinder States and schools in their efforts to improve their education programs. Under Ed-Flex--this proposal, not just for the 12 States, but for all 50 States--school districts do not have to march up to Washington each time they want to ask for a waiver. Instead, they can get the waiver from their own State.The Ed-Flex program, as it is called, has reduced paperwork burdens. That sounds good, to reduce paperwork, but when you take the expensive paperwork out of the equation, more of the resource reaches the classroom. Sure, it is good to reduce paperwork, but it is even better to deliver the resource to the site of learning, where students learn.For example, in response to a perceived need, Texas schools have been able to direct some of their Federal funds from the title II Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which is targeted primarily for science and mathematics, to reading, English language, arts, and social studies. If you need help in English and the arts and social studies, why not be able to focus the attention there?In Howard County, MD, Ed-Flex authority has allowed schools to provide additional instruction time in reading and math to better meet the needs of their students. Well, you mean a program that serves the needs of the students instead of serving the plan of the bureaucracy? What a good program.These are all States that have been allowed, in the 12-State pilot program, to have this kind of flexibility--it is interesting that they are moving resources to help students. Oregon used its waiver authority to simplify its planning and application process so that its school districts can develop a single plan that consolidates the application for Federal funds. Well, that is great. Instead of spending more money on paperwork, we are making resources available to the classrooms where students study and achieve.In Vermont, they have reported that the greatest advantage of having Ed-Flex is the ability of schools and districts to gain waivers without having to go directly to the Department of Education. The fact that the State can grant waivers with a minimum of redtape encourages schools and districts to ask for waivers they might not otherwise have asked for. You see, the intimidation factor of Federal regulation is one that is hard to assess. But here is the State of Vermont basically saying they were lacking creativity in their schools and people didn't bother to try to ask for the waiver. They went ahead and did what Washington said, in spite of the fact that it may not have been best for students, because they had been intimidated. The process was too complex. The desire to get a waiver may never have been really strong enough to get them past the Federal bureaucracy. But the schools are now doing things, trying things, delivering help to students, meeting needs at the site of learning, rather than meeting the appetite of the bureaucracy.Other Ed-Flex States have used the waiver authority to include all school improvement resources in a single 34-page plan rather than 8 separate plans totaling 200 pages. Can you imagine that? If you can move the paperwork down in the direction of sort of manual operations from 200 pages to 34 pages, you will cut out that kind of paperwork and you are cutting out a wasted resource, and when you stop wasting, you can start delivering.I am sure this next item is of special interest to the occupant of the Chair, who served as the chief executive of Ohio. Reports indicate that Ohio used its Ed-Flex authority to significantly reduce paperwork in the schools. The education agency of the State also reduced its paperwork. This is great news to hear. Ohio is the State that reported at one time that 52 percent of all the paperwork--I think that is right; the Chair might correct me--required of their school districts was related to participation in Federal programs while the Federal dollars were about 5 percent of the State's total education budget. That means we are costing people a lot in terms of paperwork to get a very small amount of the resource. It is time we freed the system from the burden of paperwork so it can get moving forward to the task of helping students.States are finding that flexibility and regulatory relief they have gotten under the Ed-Flex program has caused increased student performance. Texas has found that its schools with Ed-Flex waivers made gains that match--and in many instances exceed--those as a whole in the State. And frequently those schools with the waivers were ones that were especially challenged.Because of the success of the Ed-Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, we need to expand this concept to every State in America. In my home State of Missouri, we don't currently have broad authority, the kind of authority we need to waive the Federal regulations that keep our schools from improving education programs. In the past few years, my State, as well as local districts in Missouri, have had to come to Washington on a number of occasions and ask for waivers of certain Federal education statutes so they could administer their programs in such a way that they can better serve their students. It doesn't make any sense for a State or a school district to keep coming to Washington time after time to beg for permission to help their students. It seems like we could agree that we would allow States to help their students.That is why I support the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, because it gives the States the authority on their own to grant to schools waivers of Federal statutes and regulations for many Federal education programs. States will also be expected to grant waivers of their own regulations which schools believe are barriers to improving education programs. This is a design--a conspicuous and conscious design--to deliver resources to classrooms where students learn and improve their performance.Around the Nation, Governors of both political parties have called for quick passage of this legislation as it will allow educators to design and to deliver federally funded education dollars in ways that meet the needs of students. As a former Governor, I know how important it is for a State and its local school districts to have decisionmaking authority over educational matters. The closer the decisionmaking is to the local level, I feel, the better.States and local schools are in a better position to know what programs work in their community and elicit the necessary enthusiasm and response from their families which are being served.I also know that States want to show that their education reforms will actually improve quality of education. When I was Governor of Missouri, I also served as chairman of the Education Commission of the States--all 50 States, legislators, governors, school board officials--the Education Commission of the States. During that time I emphasized a point. And it was this: We must insist that our reform programs create a current of educational improvement. We must show that reforms actually help our children learn more.Mr. President, I believe that Ed-Flex boosts educational achievement by allowing States to direct resources where they will get to the classroom and help students learn.So today I want to voice my strong support for the Educational Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. Under this legislation, Missouri schools and schools across America no longer have to come to Washington to seek education waivers one at a time. But they will have more flexibility to administer federally funded education programs in ways that boost student achievement, and ultimately have as a result more capable students.States and local schools want more flexibility because they have the best ideas of what will work in their communities. And they want the ability to take that good news to the students of their schools. Important education groups in my State such as the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri School Board Association have said that flexibility and local control are important goals in Federal education policy.The Ed-Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 helps to accomplish these goals. This bill, Ed-Flex, will ultimately help to improve educational opportunities for the children in my State and all over the country by reducing the Federal redtape involved currently with trying to comply with Federal rules and regulations related to educational programs.,2015-03-17 19:09:02.334200,2015-03-17 19:09:02.334200,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT,1999-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-04/html/CREC-1999-03-04-pt1-PgS2255.htm,34,0,145,S2255-S2257,A000356,mr. ashcroft

But there is still much more work to be done.Because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an estimated 8,500 teaching jobs have been saved in my home State of Missouri alone. Without the Recovery Act, thousands of teachers would have lost their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of students would be losing out on individual attention vital to their education. It was the right thing to do to provide States with the resources to keep America's teachers teaching and continue investing in our children's education.This stimulus is putting us on the road to recovery by putting money back in the pockets of middle-class Americans and making critical investments in our future, like education and preparing for today's clean energy jobs.We must continue our aggressive push to put Americans back to work and make investments in ourselves for this new era of global competition.

2129,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, I came here to recognize and commend the great work of Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy on crafting an IDEA bill. They produced a solid, thoughtful, bipartisan bill which protects the educational rights of children with special needs while at the same time making IDEA more workable for parents, teachers, school administrators, and school districts.I think we all agree IDEA was a great idea. It helped open doors for many children with special needs since it was enacted in 1975. Yet there is no question that significant problems exist.As I traveled through Missouri and talked with educators, teachers, administrators, parents, and school board members, I heard all kinds of problems with IDEA. Over the years, these teachers, principals, and administrators in Missouri have told me IDEA has become a morass of rules, of regulations and litigation that truly limit access and in some instances actually hinder learning--not just for children with disabilities but for all children. That is simply not acceptable.Educators are struggling under a crushing procedural and paperwork burden imposed by IDEA, contributing to what is becoming a chronic shortage of quality teachers in special education in Missouri and nationwide. Special education teachers are leaving the profession--not out of frustration with the children whom they are there to serve, but out of frustration with the overwhelming and unnecessary paperwork and the regulatory burdens they face. Without a qualified teacher, a child with a disability cannot receive a free, appropriate public education.Most special educators report they have to spend 20 to 50 percent of their time on paperwork. More time spent on paperwork is less time spent with students or preparing lesson plans for students. It is as simple as that. We cannot continue to let IDEA interfere with the time educators can devote to the children they serve because we all know a misdirected focus on paperwork, on procedures, and on bureaucracy frustrates teachers and fails to give children the education they need.In addition, over the years IDEA has encouraged and fostered adversarial relationships between school districts, staff, and parents. Time, money, and resources exhausted in costly litigation would be far better spent on instruction for children. Taking limited dollars away from children with disabilities and redirecting them to attorneys to fight long and costly battles is simply counterproductive. It does not help the education of our children--all children, special children and other children in the schools.These are a few of the concerns I have heard from Missouri educators over the years. But the thing I like about Missouri educators is they don't simply tell me what the problem is; they show me how to fix it. Maybe that is one of the reasons they call Missouri the ``Show Me'' State.The Missouri School Board Association's Special Education Advocacy Council, working in partnership with the Missouri Council of Administrators of Special Education, developed a list of thoughtful, solid, and detailed recommendations to improve IDEA and inject a little bit of good old-fashioned commonsense reform to IDEA.In fact, the Missouri Special Education Advocacy Council examined the IDEA statute line by line and told me exactly where and how we improve the statute by refocusing special education on educating children with special needs rather than simply complying with a system of complex regulations and mountains of paperwork and red tape.I am pleased many of the recommendations made by MSBA's Special Education Advocacy Council have been incorporated in S. 1248. The numerous paperwork and regulatory reforms in the bill will go a long way to free special educators' time to spend with their students and in preparing effective instruction plans. In addition, this bill contains many provisions to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents and school districts.I thank both Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for including these critical reforms in the Senate bill. This bill will improve and strengthen IDEA and extend the promise of quality education for a new generation of children with special needs.I urge my colleagues to support this bill.There is one other thing I want to address. I want to talk a minute about funding IDEA. We heard a lot of talk yesterday about the broken promises. The authorization for IDEA said the Federal Government is going to provide 40 percent of the cost of IDEA. Over 19 years, funding for IDEA has increased from $251,000 in 1977 to $2.3 billion in 1996.Our side took control of Congress in 1995, and over the course of that time period, the Republican Congress has increased funding for IDEA by 224 percent since 1996. That was done through the appropriations process.If the President's budget is enacted, it will have increased funding for IDEA by 376 percent. The average per-pupil expenditure has increased from 7 percent to almost 20 percent. If you include the President's budget request for this year, IDEA funding since 2001 will have increased $4.7 billion--75 percent in this President's budget.In comparison, in the 1980s IDEA was one of the spending appropriations categories that did not increase. In fact, in many of those years the Federal Government covered less than the States' average per-pupil expenditure for children with disabilities than it had the year before.

2130,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark Supreme Court case that gave rise to Linda Brown's dream of equality in education in this country, a dream deferred that has become for many a broken promise.The 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision marked a turning point in our history and incited a movement to break down barriers of race that had long plagued communities across the nation. It helped pave the road toward integral measures such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Fair Housing Act of 1968 and began the movement for desegregation. Chief Justice Earl Warren felt the ruling was so historic he issued a rare public statement: ``We conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place.'' In declaring segregation unconstitutional, the Supreme Court mandated a focus on equality not only in education, but also in public transportation, accommodations and commerce.The Brown v. Board of Education decision demanded that all Americans be entitled to the fundamental right to equal educational opportunities, regardless of race, and the resources to achieve their dreams. But by the time Martin Luther King, Jr. addressed America from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, nearly ten years later, that promise remained unfulfilled. And half a century later, with the convulsing explosions of the Civil Rights Movement behind us, the future assured to Linda Brown in that historic ruling has been approached, but not yet reached. And we are left to wonder, like Langston Hughes in his poem ``A Dream Deferred,'' whether those promises, if not fulfilled, will one day cease to exist.Fifty years ago, Linda Brown, a third grader in Topeka, Kansas, and her father had the courage to protest the long accepted ``separate but equal'' principle that required her to walk for over an hour every morning because she was not permitted to attend the white-only school just blocks from her house. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court struck down the ``badge of inferiority for African Americans'' that the principle of ``separate but equal'' had come to signify.This week we honor all those who fought for the dream of equality of opportunity: the valiant families who came forward in these five cases; the NAACP legal defense team, including Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood Marshall, Robert L. Carter, Kenneth B. Clark and Judge Constance Motley; and the community which held on to the dream through years of bitter opposition and violent protest in the South. But half a century later, urban and rural schools across America lack the funding to provide equal education opportunities for all students.An Education Trust study released last week reveals alarming statistics about the state of education: Minority students are about three years behind other students by the time they reach eighth grade; 17-year-old African American and Latino students have reading and math skills similar to those of 13-year-old white students; and African American and Latino and American Indian youth are less likely to be enrolled in full college prep coursework.No Child Left Behind, underfunded by $27 billion, could achieve the dream of Brown v. Board of Education if provided with the resources to dismantle unequal opportunities and enhance the quality of education for every community. Fifty years after Brown, we continue to make promises we cannot keep.As we remember today the dream of Linda Brown and the courageous civil rights leaders to whom we owe our progress, let us remember that the most fitting tribute to them is a continued effort to fulfill their vision for our nation. Let us continue the promise of Brown by breaking down the barriers that still persist in our classrooms and giving schools the resources they need to provide a safe and productive learning environment for our children.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this historic anniversary and renewing the effort to achieve the promise of Brown v. Board of Education: equal educational opportunities for all children. Let us not defer the dream any longer.,2015-03-17 19:09:03.726195,2015-03-17 19:09:03.726195,Extensions,COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN v.

2131,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, Missouri State Representative D.J. Davis is retiring at the end of the year. He has served the people of the 122nd district since 1996.A graduate of North Andrew High School in Rosendale, Missouri, Representative Davis graduated with a bachelor of science degree in secondary education from Northwest Missouri State University in 1962 and a master's degree in secondary administration in 1970. Before serving in the Missouri House of Representatives, Representative. Davis worked in the field of education for more than 30 years. He retired as the principal of Odessa High School in Odessa, Missouri.As an educator, Representative Davis was recognized for his contributions to the field. He received the Missouri Association of Secondary School Principals Silver Service Award in 1991 for 25 years as a secondary school principal. Additionally, he received awards from the Lafayette County Farm Bureau, the Mighty MO 4-H Club, the Missouri Association for Career and Technical Education and the AARP.Mr. Speaker, whether as an educator or a legislator, Representative Davis has worked on behalf of others and is truly a role model for young Missourians. He has made important contributions to both fields.

During his long service to education, he has been a leader and role model for thousands of children.James started out teaching fourth, fifth, and sixth grades before serving as Assistant Principal at Bernard and Trautwein Elementary. In 1986, he became Principal of Beasley Elementary School.James' commitment to his work is overshadowed only by his dedication to serving his community. Instead of calling it quits at five o'clock, James devotes his time and energy to helping the community through his volunteer activities. He lends his skills to the Parish Council at St. Margaret Mary School, advising them on various education issues. He coaches baseball and soccer and serves as a Parent Teacher Organization officer.I know that the teachers, parents, and students at Beasley Elementary will greatly miss James. I wish James and his wife Jeanne all the best in retirement, and I urge my colleagues to join me in saluting James Schibig. ,2015-03-17 19:09:03.993386,2015-03-17 19:09:03.993386,Senate,TRIBUTE TO JAMES SCHIBIG,2001-05-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-02/html/CREC-2001-05-02-pt1-PgS4170.htm,58,0,147,S4170,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2133,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from New Mexico yielding and especially for taking the initiative to really focus on what I believe should be a national dialogue, and that is the education of our kids.I am not embarrassed to admit that I am a 5-month-old parent. And, of course, as a new parent, one's attention begins to focus maybe on different priorities. I know in our household we have, and we have begun to think about the education of our daughter Casey Elizabeth.Here in Washington, as my friend knows, too often I think we begin to focus on or define our Nation's educational success by how many dollars that we put toward public education. If that were the yardstick, then I think the Republicans here in the House deserve great credit. Since 1995, public funding education has been increased by 27 percent over those several years.But that is not how I think we should define educational success. To me, it is much simpler than that; that success is defined by how much our children learn. And, of course, I think key in that is trying to get parents to become more involved in the education of their kids.Now, as my colleague knows, as a mother, we cannot pass a law in this body that mandates parents' attendance at PTA meetings. Some wish maybe we could force that mandate on families, but that is not the role of the Government. But I think there are things that we can do. And as my friend has talked about, the bill that we have on the floor on Thursday this week, H.R. 7, I think is a key component. It is not the answer to all of our educational problems; but I think as far as parental control, we do provide some incentives, yes, through the Tax Code.Our idea of this bill is very simple. We think that the Federal tax should be eliminated if they are saving for education. As my colleague was pointing out just a few minutes ago, current law that this President signed into law, this education savings account, says that up to $500 a year can be contributed by a family member into an account.But as you also very ably pointed out that even if, let us say, over the course of the lifetime of your child, from the moment they were born every year until they go to college, the money they would have saved for college is about $15,000 and that is assuming compound interest at about 7\1/2\ percent. So I think first and foremost, we have to sort of take that limit off to really encourage parents to be saving even more for the education of their kids.To me, the perfect bill that the President should sign into law would be, number one, an elimination of the marriage penalty tax; and since most of that is about $1,400 more per couple, then that family with children can plug that money into an expanded education savings account. As you pointed out, the point is saving for higher education is important.And yes, perhaps the controversy in this bill as we are probably going to hear in less measured tones as we debate this bill in the next couple of days is, we think that elementary and secondary education expenses should qualify. If your first grader is having a tough time reading, why not use the proceeds of an education savings account to maybe purchase Hooked on Phonics to help bring your child up to the reading level that he or she should be in a particular grade. If you are having trouble with math, maybe a home computer or a computer program that might help a child learn math better, or maybe a foreign language. It could even be expenses like car pooling or transportation expenses. The beauty of an expanded savings account is, it is not the government saying how money should be spent. It is the parents. I think what a powerful ally that a parent can be working with a teacher in addressing the special needs of that particular child.,2015-03-17 19:09:04.126481,2015-03-17 19:09:04.126481,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,2000-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-28/html/CREC-2000-03-28-pt1-PgH1455-4.htm,36,2,146,H1455-H1461,H000948,mr. hulshof

June, like myself, is retiring at the end of this Congress, and I want to thank her for her many years of service to me and our institution.June came to work for me in 1979. She has spent nearly her entire career here in Congress working on educational issues, specifically ensuring that educational opportunity exists for the most vulnerable in our society. June has worked in both my personal office and on my Education and the Workforce Committee staff, where she presently serves as Education Coordinator. Prior to her Capitol Hill career, June was a teacher in the Baltimore public schools and the head of a department in a junior high school. June has also earned a Ph.D from the University of Maryland, showing evidence of her own personal pursuit of excellence.June has always fought to make sure all Americans have the opportunity to succeed. She has represented me well by helping open the doors of educational and economic opportunity for our most disadvantaged citizens. June has always stood for what was right and never compromised her principles. She has provided me with 21 years of invaluable service that has improved the education of the children of St. Louis and the nation.

2135,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished manager.Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coverdell measure and in support of the Gorton-Frist amendment and in support of the Ashcroft amendment. We have an opportunity as a body to make some very clear statements about education that the people in our States are asking us to make.I firmly believe that education is a national priority but a local responsibility. This leads to a fundamental difference between this side and what might be referred to as a Washington establishment on education.I believe that those who know the names of the students personally are better at making decisions than those who don't know them. Unfortunately, Federal involvement in education over the years has started off with a great idea of providing resources in support for what we believe for our children is the highest priority, and that is getting them a good education, but it has mushroomed into burdensome regulations, judicial intrusion, unfunded mandates and unwanted meddling.The results have been that local school officials who are accountable to parents and communities have increasingly less and less control over what goes on in their classrooms. In some cases, parents really feel that they have lost control of their child's education. They have told me horror stories about how their children are not getting an education because of requirements that the Federal Government has put on the schools.I believe that parents and local school boards are and must be the key to true educational reform, not big Government. We should be empowering parents and teachers and school districts and States to develop challenging academic standards, programs and priorities, not making their jobs of educating children of America more difficult.As my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, said, we already have standards, we already have tests. As a result of those tests, we know where the problems are in education, and we need to do something about it. Yes, nationally we ought to focus on the problem, but we ought not to try to solve with a ``Washington, DC, solution'' the problems we face in every community and every city throughout Missouri and throughout America.I have had a very interesting and informative experience over the last year and a half talking to school board members, talking to teachers, talking to principals and talking to parents across my State of Missouri. It is from these discussions that I come back here with a renewed commitment to keep local control over education.We have school districts in Missouri hiring hordes of consultants and grant writers instead of teachers because they know they have to play ``Mother May I?'' with Washington, DC. We have some schools, the smaller schools, that say they don't even bother to apply for the Federal funds because they don't have the time and the resources to prepare the application.Leaders in school districts have told me of the unforeseen consequences of getting a grant. They get a grant development program and the grant expires and the school district has to determine whether to take local money from existing resources to continue the program or to eliminate it.One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said very, very convincingly today, and I love these words, ``The Federal Government doesn't run schools, and the Federal Government doesn't fund schools.'' I agree with those principles. I just wish that he were correct in the facts.The Federal Government should not be micromanaging school districts. In Missouri, 67 percent of the funds that go to the school districts come from the Federal Government. These are general funds for K through 12. They tell me, depending upon the school district, that anywhere from 40 to 85 percent of the red tape and the hassle and the regulations come from Washington.I don't think that is right. Last year, when we adopted the Gorton amendment to send money directly to the schools, some of my colleagues very eloquently said, ``We don't want to have Federal dollars going directly to school districts because the school districts will waste the money; they might build athletic facilities; or they will waste it in some other way.''Mr. President, I have spent my adult career working with parents and teachers and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I have watched their education decisions. I have spent about the last 11 years in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal bureaucracy administer programs. And when it comes to who wastes money, Mr. President, it is not even close. It is not a contest. The Washington way wastes more money by far. The locally controlled schools are far better at applying those dollars to the needs of the children in their schools.There is no disagreement that in some cases a local school district may need money to build some more schools or it may need money to hire more teachers. For some schools, new textbooks should be the top priority. For others, additional computers might be needed or a school safety program might need to be implemented.Who knows best? Those at the local level, held accountable by those they serve, or the bureaucrats in Washington? A one-size-fits-all approach does not and will not work in education. Let us give our schools, our teachers, and our parents the resources and flexibility they need to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement and accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendments and to support the bill, and I urge that they give a sound, strong endorsement to local control over education.I reserve the remainder of the time on this side and yield the floor. Again, I extend my sincere thanks to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:09:04.381662,2015-03-17 19:09:04.381662,Senate,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS,1998-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-22/html/CREC-1998-04-22-pt1-PgS3410.htm,45,4,144,S3410-S3423,B000611,mr. bond
2136,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Chairman, I rise today to talk about a very important issue, and that is overidentification and misidentification of children with suspected learning behavioral disabilities. If schools misdiagnose a child, it not only affects their report card, but it affects their future. We need to make sure that the right children receive special education.The Tancredo-Graves amendment seeks to address this problem which is driving up the cost of IDEA and putting misdiagnosed kids into special needs programs. The majority of kids with disabilities are medically diagnosed and, therefore, receive special education services. Children with learning and behavioral disorders should be no different.The bottom line is if a child has a medical disability, whether it be physical, mental, learning or behavioral, it should be diagnosed and have a medical opinion from a medical professional in order to receive the same special education services as those children that are medically diagnosed.The Tancredo-Graves amendment would protect parents, and most importantly, it would protect children from being labeled with a disability that they may not have.,2015-03-17 19:09:04.604821,2015-03-17 19:09:04.604821,House,IMPROVING EDUCATION RESULTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 2003,2003-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-30/html/CREC-2003-04-30-pt1-PgH3458.htm,63,224,149,H3458-H3531,G000546,mr. graves

2139,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, studies and reports have shown that PAT children at age 3 are found to be significantly more advanced than comparison children in language, problem solving, and social development. Often, through participation in PAT, learning problems or development delays are identified and treated early.PAT parents are more confident in their parenting abilities and knowledge. The great thing is, PAT hooks parents early on which means that they are more likely to stay involved in their children's schooling.We all know that we can have all the programs in the world and can provide all the funding possible, but one of the main ingredients to a child's success in school is the involvement of the child's parents in the child's education.As I said, earlier this year I received a copy of a report from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report was the ``School Entry Assessment Project''. The summary of findings reinforced my interest, support, and commitment to PAT. The findings of the report are as follows:1. When Parents as Teachers is combined with any other pre- kindergarten experience for high-poverty children, the children score above average on all scales when they enter kindergarten. 2. The highest performing children participate in PAT and preschool or center care. Among children who participate in PAT and attend preschool, both minority and non-minority children score above average. Children in both high-poverty and low-poverty schools who participate in PAT and attend preschool score above average when they enter kindergarten. 3. Among children whose care and education are sole home- based, those whose families participate in PAT score significantly higher. 4. Special needs children who participate in PAT and preschool in addition to an early childhood special education program are rated by teachers as being similar in preparation to the average child. 5. Head Start children who also participate in PAT and another preschool score at average or above when they enter kindergarten.This findings sum it all up. PAT works. PAT works for children raised in household of all income levels. PAT works for children who are home-schooled. PAT works for our special needs children.My amendment makes certain that priority is given to programs such as PAT and other early childhood parent education programs.With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:09:05.037127,2015-03-17 19:09:05.037127,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT,2001-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-16/html/CREC-2001-05-16-pt1-PgS4970-2.htm,67,177,147,S4970-S4999,B000611,mr. bond

They worked for better than a year to fashion legislation that I believe strengthens our country's commitment to higher education.I also want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman Goodling) and all the committee members who made valuable contributions to the higher education reauthorization effort. I am pleased to give my enthusiastic support for this bill.The bill strengthens student aid financing by significantly reducing student loan interest rates, increasing Pell Grants and improving the calculations of benefits for independent and dependent students. The bill adopts a number of measures that enhance support for minority and disadvantaged students by strengthening the TRIO program and other programs supporting historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions and tribally controlled colleges.Mr. Chairman, I am also pleased that the committee adopted President Clinton's High Hopes program. And I commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) for his successful advocacy of this important initiative.Mr. Chairman, the bill also includes a number of provisions aimed at improving services to students on campus such as enhanced campus crime reporting, a new campus-based child care program and streamlining financial aid procedures.I am also pleased that teacher education and recruitment received a boost in this bill by the adoption of a loan forgiveness program for new teachers and strong teaching training partnerships. As we continue to work on this bipartisan bill, I hope that we can continue our efforts to resolve issues regarding loan consolidation interest rates, guarantee agencies, and the National Board for Teacher Certification.Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my hope that we will unanimously reject attempts to undermine this bipartisan bill through the introduction of a divisive anti-affirmative action amendment. The Riggs amendment has received universal condemnation among all those who care deeply about expanding educational opportunities for all Americans. Students, colleges, civil rights groups, editorial boards and women's groups across this country have urged us to reject this giant leap backwards.Last night, Secretary Riley and Attorney General Reno sent an urgent message to Congress expressing their strongest possible opposition to this very dangerous amendment. They would urge the President to veto H.R. 6 if the Riggs amendment is adopted.

2141,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and say thanks to a 31-year veteran educator in our public school system. The superintendent of Sikeston schools, Dr. Robert ``Bob'' Buchanan, has decided to move on to life's next challenge.Bob's retirement closes a remarkable chapter in Sikeston, Missouri's Public R-VI School District. As a teacher, coach, principal, and ultimately superintendent, Bob Buchanan has done it all in his 25 years in Sikeston. Moreover, he's been a positive influence on so many kids and touched many of their families over the past 31 years of dedication to education.Bob's long and winding road in education started in January 1966 when he first was hired as a social studies instructor in Harrisburg, AR. He then moved across the border to his home State to teach social studies in Bernie, MO--his original hometown--and just down the road in Charleston, MO, before planting new and, as we know today, deep roots in Sikeston in 1972.Bob Buchanan is a leader by example. His community service record is exemplary. For instance, Bob is a member of Sikeston's chamber of commerce quality of life committee. He's also on the physicians medical organization board, Missouri Delta medical center board, Sikeston area development council board, and in the mid-eighties, he served as chairman of the board of adjustment.Bob also knows that you must keep learning in life so that you're prepared for the next challenge or hurdle. His personal achievements in his academic pursuits are impressive. After graduating from Bernie High School in 1961, Bob graduated from Arkansas State University with a bachelor of science in education. He earned his master in education administration from Southeast Missouri State University in my hometown of Cape Girardeau in 1971. He graduated with honors 10 years later in 1981 with a specialist in education administration from Southeast Missouri State. Then, in 1987, he earned his doctor of philosophy from the Department of Educational Leadership at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Remember, most of these scholastic achievements came about in his spare time because Bob's full-time job was educating our children and helping to provide them a better, brighter future.Although this will be the last school year for Bob as superintendent of Sikeston schools, I'm sure folks will still find him going to every Bulldog game he and his wife Glenda can attend. Most importantly, I hope that the enthusiastic spirit and drive for excellence that Dr. Buchanan brings to the classrooms under his charge lives on for future generations. Bob Buchanan will be missed, but I truly believe his legacy will live on.,2015-03-17 19:09:05.304317,2015-03-17 19:09:05.304317,Extensions,DR.

2142,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.Mr. Speaker, this motion would instruct the conferees to oppose the Senate amendment offered by Senator Lott that reneges on last year's agreement to fund the Clinton-Clay class size reduction plan.Last year we made a $1.2 billion down payment on a plan to help communities hire 100,000 new, well- qualified teachers over the next 7 years. All across this country, parents and students who are facing overcrowded classrooms are counting on Congress' commitment to reduce class sizes.The Lott amendment reneges on this commitment, and cynically pits one group of parents against another for money that Congress has already designated to be spent for class size reduction.All major education groups oppose this insidious attack on the class size reduction plan. The National Parents and Teachers Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the Chief States School Officers and the National Education Association, even Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania, according to press accounts, opposes the Lott amendment because it jeopardizes passage of the Ed-Flex bill.Finally, Mr. Speaker, I believe President Clinton would veto a bill that undermines funding for class size reduction. These new teachers are needed in the early grades, to reduce class size to no more than 18 children. Achieving the goal of 100,000 new teachers will ensure that every child receives personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning, and is prepared to read by the end of the third grade.Department of Education data shows that students in smaller classes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana and Tennessee outperformed their counterparts in larger classes. A study of Tennessee's Project Star found that students in smaller classes in Grades K through 3 earned much higher scores on basic skills tests. Based on this solid record of achievement, the Clinton-Clay class size reduction initiative should be granted a long-term authorization.Mr. Speaker, this motion further instructs the conferees to insist that additional funding be appropriated for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. Rather than forcing one vital program to compete for funds against another, we should instead pursue a greater overall investment in public education. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this motion and, by doing so, give both the class size reduction initiative and IDEA the opportunity to be funded at an appropriate level.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:05.449421,2015-03-17 19:09:05.449421,House,APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 800, EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-23/html/CREC-1999-03-23-pt1-PgH1549.htm,46,8,145,H1549-H1556,C000488,mr. clay
2143,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I am grateful to him and to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) for bringing this bill to the floor. I am also grateful to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for the great work he has done on this committee for so many years, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to serve from our State with him and appreciate his commitment to this debate and his commitment to better education. I think that is what this debate is about. I think this bill, the base bill, provides that. Certainly the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) just mentioned appropriately the importance of quality teachers in the early grades. But I think quality teachers are important throughout the process.What this legislation does is allow ways to enhance the quality of teachers. It really decides where that decision is going to be made, whether that decision is going to be made in Washington, whether the decision as to what a local school district needs is made here on the floor of the Congress and here in the Halls of the bureaucracy in Washington or whether it is made in the school district, whether it is made in the principal's office in conjunction with the teacher and the school board and parents. I think they can best make those decisions. This bill is another step in that direction. Certainly reducing class size is an option here. But so is better education and special education. More funding for special education teachers, more mentoring, more teacher quality, all of those things have the potential to have great impact in different situations in different districts. We do not know here.The gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) mentioned earlier that in Delaware they are already down to 17 students as the maximum in a class in elementary. But there are certainly things I am confident in Delaware that they need, that they have not done all they need to do. Simply because they have made the steps already to reduce class size does not mean we should penalize people in that State from being able to do other things that enhance quality of education. I believe this bill does that. I am grateful that it is on the floor today. I intend to vote for it and encourage my colleagues not to be for the substitute.,2015-03-17 19:09:05.649563,2015-03-17 19:09:05.649563,House,TEACHER EMPOWERMENT ACT,1999-07-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-20/html/CREC-1999-07-20-pt1-PgH5856-2.htm,103,102,145,H5856-H5919,B000575,mr. blunt
2144,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Maureen Clancy-May, and honor her for her years of service to the people of the St. Louis area.Dr. Clancy-May has achieved many milestones during her 33 years in education. She received her Bachelor's in Teaching Exceptional Children from Southeast Missouri State University, her Masters of Education from the University of Missouri-St. Louis, and her Ph.D. from Saint Louis University in Educational Administration. Dr. Clancy-May then applied her knowledge as a teacher, a Director of Student Services, a Principal, and as an Assistant Superintendent for schools across the St. Louis area. She has also shared her knowledge and experience with other educators as an adjunct professor in the Education Leadership Department at Saint Louis University.Since July 1, 2004, Dr. Clancy-May has worked as the Superintendent of Schools for the Bayless School District. There, she led the Bayless School District to achieve full accreditation and Missouri's Accreditation with Distinction. Under her guidance, Bayless Elementary School and Bayless Junior High earned both the Missouri and the National School of Character awards. Her determination to improve her school district resulted in numerous awards for the district, as well as a $1.5 million math and science grant.In addition to her work in education, Dr. Clancy-May supports her community in many ways. She is an active member of the Rotary Club of St. Louis County and the Lemay Chamber of Commerce, and has served four years on the Board of the Affton Community Chamber of Commerce. She is a member of numerous education organizations, serving as a representative on the Missouri Association of School Administrators' Executive Committee and as the president of the Cooperating School Districts of the Greater St. Louis Area's Board. Dr. Clancy-May has also been recognized for her many accomplishments, including: being awarded with the FOCUS St. Louis What's Right with the Region Award; Hardee's Hometown Hero Award; and the Southeast Missouri State University Alumni Merit Award.Dr. Clancy-May has dedicated much of her life to serving the St. Louis community. I congratulate Dr. Maureen Clancy-May for her devotion to one of the nation's most important professions: educating our children and preparing them for a responsible and productive adulthood.,2015-03-17 19:09:05.782658,2015-03-17 19:09:05.782658,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DR.

2145,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,I thank the manager.Mr. President, there have been numerous times that I have come to the Senate floor to say--and I come, once again, to repeat--that education is a national priority, but it is an obligation and responsibility of those at the State and local level. The education of our children has traditionally been--and ought to be in the future--carried out and implemented at the local level.I remember a couple of years ago when we were talking about Federal control that one of my colleagues, who is now no longer with us, was in a debate with a representative in the Department of Education. The Department of Education person said: I care just as much about your children and their needs and their operations in school and their success as you do, to which he replied: Well, that's great. Do you know their names? No. Do you know what their scores are? No. Do you know what their challenges are? No. Do you know where their schools are? No.The simple fact is that none of us here in Washington, no matter how much we are concerned about education in general and children in general, can know what the problems are and what the challenges are and how best to meet those challenges for students in each local school district throughout this Nation.I think we would all say that each child is different. Each school district is different. Each school is different. I think for that and other good reasons the Federal role in education has been a limited one, and I believe it should be. The underlying bill before us--S. 1--recognizes the nature and the scope of this role. The legislation creates a leadership role for the Federal Government in encouraging States to adopt commonsense systems based upon standards, measurements, and accountability. The underlying bill as reported out of our committee did not attempt to micromanage the local schools and classrooms.S. 1 also would give us the opportunity to redefine how we measure success. For too long, many of my colleagues here have supported throwing more and more money at education. And the Washington-based education establishment generally has determined our success in education programs based on the dollars spent--not on the academic achievements, not on the progress, and not on what our children are learning in school to be better prepared for their role in this increasingly complex and competitive society.If more money were the answer, we wouldn't be debating this bill because we wouldn't have the problem. We have poured more and more Federal money into education, and the academic achievement of our students has been level or in some cases it has fallen behind.In pouring more money into public education, we have gone to great lengths to detail precisely how those teachers--the men and women who know the names of the child in their classroom, and know what his or her problems are, more and more they are being told what to do by Washington.According to the Education Commission of the States:In the 1999-2000 budget, the federal government spent almost $44 billion on elementary and secondary education programs. This funding was spread across 35 different education programs in 15 different federal departments.We did a little research a couple years ago and found out there are over 760 education programs. It was that proliferation of good ideas from Washington that led me at the time to propose what we call the Direct Check For Education, to combine some of those biggest programs, cut the redtape, send it back to the school districts, and tell the school districts these are all things we think you ought to consider but do not require them to dot every i and cross every t, jump through the hoops, and fill out forms and fill out reports and play ``Mother May I'' with the Federal Government.All of these programs that exist today were started with good intentions, and they have gotten more money. Look at the money. Shown on this chart are the appropriations for ESEA programs in billions of dollars. Starting in 1990, it looks as if, oh, around $7 billion was spent, and now it has gone up to, oh, I would say close to $380 billion.This shows what has happened in the average national scale math scores for 9-year-olds. That is measured on the chart with the green line. It is a flat line. If that were a line on a key chart in a hospital measuring the heartbeat of the patient, it would say the patient is dead. All the money has produced no appreciable benefits. That is the math scores.Maybe we can look at another chart to see if we got any better results. How have we done in reading? This chart has the appropriations for ESEA programs in billions of dollars. It is the same type of chart as the last one. It shows the national 4th grade reading scores: a flat line, no life in the patient. We are not getting any better. We are spending more money to do no better.I am afraid we are about to hijack S. 1 and turn it into a replay of the same kind of Federal micromanagement and Federal direction of education that has managed to use a whole lot of money without getting any results.These Federal programs--the Education Commission of the States says 35; I say over 760--have gotten us burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. The folks at the local level--whether they be parents or teachers or school board members or administrators--say they have less and less control. Jobs of our teachers and administrators are harder than they should be. We have eroded the opportunity for creativity and motivation.I don't know how many of you have taken the opportunity to do what I have done in Missouri. Over the last 3 years, I have traveled throughout the State--in the metropolitan areas, the suburban areas, the rural areas--and I have met with representatives of teachers, of school board members, of administrators. I have asked: What is the problem here? And too many of them have come back to say: We are spending our time as glorified grantsmen, trying to get more money from the Federal Government, trying to jump through the hoops, trying to do what the Federal Government wants us to do. We don't have the time to prepare our lessons and to prepare our students for the education they need for a lifetime.This is a serious problem. This is what the teachers, the administrators, the school board members are telling us throughout my State. It comes through loud and clear, and it is on a bipartisan basis. From the most conservative Republicans to the most liberal Democrats, the people in Missouri, who are involved at the local school level, tell us there is far too much time, effort, and energy wasted on complying with Federal dictates, Federal mandates.Some of our schools say that, although the Federal Government only provides an average of about 5 percent--I guess in Missouri it is a little less than the national average of the dollars going to education--it, in effect, controls about 50 percent of what is done because these Federal mandates and these Federal dictates--all these good ideas that went into these programs--tell the local schools how they ought to handle the programs they would otherwise be doing to educate their kids. And most of them say, well over 50 percent of the redtape and the headache and the requirements and the hassle they go through comes from the Federal Government.How can we afford to keep spending Federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing it for years if it is not achieving any success? I do not think we can. I do not think we should stand for it. I have talked to too many parents and teachers, school board members, community and business leaders who say: Our children deserve better. This country deserves better.Over the past several years, I have opposed the creation of specific new programs and their dictates on the style of their education, even these amendments that have been offered in good faith. These amendments were good ideas, if we had taken our good ideas and ran for membership on a school board. I am sure many of my colleagues could make great contributions if they were on the school board in Mexico, MO, or the R-6 school district or the St. Louis city school board or the Jefferson City school board, but we are not.The problem is, there are different needs and different challenges in Missouri, in Washington, in Arizona, in Maine, or in Florida. When we pass a law, when we pass a dictate or a requirement, we do not know how that is going to impact the kids who are the ones who have to be taught. We may understand education in general, but there are educational needs that are specific and direct in each school district as the individual student involved.I cannot believe, if my colleagues went back home, spent some time, saddled up the horses, went out and just rode the circuit, that you wouldn't hear the same things. I know, first hand. Our State has some of the best teachers, the best principals, superintendents, and school board members in the country. They are outstanding people. They are really concerned.You think we are concerned about education. Well, we were concerned about education last week and will be this week, but we have to be concerned about the budget, we have to be concerned about tax policy, and we are going to be concerned about energy policy.These dedicated men and women are spending their lifetime dedicated to one thing; that is, teaching our children. What do the people who are actually involved in education have to say?The superintendent of Springfield, MO, public schools said:. . . the amount of paperwork that the federal government causes local school districts to engage in is often overwhelming. The extra effort and time often reduces productive classroom time and energy that could better be spent working directly with children.Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV school said:Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had in mind.From the Neosho, MO, R-5 school district:The individuals who are working most closely with the students are indeed the ones who can best decide how this money can be spent for the benefit of students' education.The superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County said:As head of a school district specializing in special education, I fully understand how my district's financial needs differ from other school district's needs. In order to best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those funds to the best use.The president of the board of education of the Blue Springs, MO, school district said:Without local control, the focus is taken away from the needs specific to the children in each school system.But I think maybe the superintendent of the Taneyville, MO, R-II school district sums it up well:I feel that State and Federal government has tied our school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school does this; pull it another way and the school does that. School systems and communities are as different from one another as individual people are different. What works for one will not work for another.I offer those because that is the kind of information all of us need as we move forward on any kind of education bill, certainly one as important as the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. My colleagues haven't been in a position to listen to those people and ask them questions directly, but I suggest to them, if they go home and ask questions, they will hear the same, with similar eloquence and similar heartfelt concern, in their States.To me the issue is simple: We must give our States and localities the flexibility to utilize the limited amount of Federal resources as they see fit and hold them accountable in the form of academic achievement. We must recognize and reward States and localities that succeed in improving academic achievement. There also should be consequences for States and localities that fail.We have a choice between having Washington, DC, control our schools and the local level. Who is most likely to waste money? There is no contest there. Unfortunately, we have demonstrated in Washington collectively that no matter how good our ideas, how well intentioned our efforts are to provide direction and counseling and hope for schools, we may not be doing the right job; we may be causing them more problem.A little girl hustling to school--she was late for school--said a little prayer that she would get to school on time. She went about another half block and got going too fast and fell down on her face. She offered up another little prayer: I would like you to help me to get to school, but don't push so hard. I fell down.Sometimes we are pushing a little too hard. Sometimes what we try to do to help the people who are trying to deliver education try to uplift and empower our children pushes them down on their face. I think it is time that we consolidate those programs, that we take all these great revenues and give parents a say. Let school boards determine the policy, let administrators know how to run their school, and let teachers who know the names and the problems and the opportunities and the potential of each child make those educational decisions.S. 1, the underlying bill, consolidates a myriad of Federal programs into a set of programs designed to allow States and local school districts to make decisions on their own, to determine their priorities, recognizing that education reform will take place in the classroom, not because of all of the wonderful, great ideas we have in Washington, DC. The underlying concept of S. 1 is the right way to go.Amendments on class size are absolutely unnecessary. Class size reduction is an option in S. 1's larger, more flexible program for improving the quality of classroom teaching. It should be an option, not a mandate.Let me ask this question: Has it been shown that a fifth grade class must have only so many children in it to be successful? I have talked to a lot of administrators who say the most important thing for teaching that fifth grade class and each child in it is to make sure the quality of the teacher is good. If we can't come up with two quality teachers, all we do, in splitting up the class, is say to those children who go with a less qualified teacher that they don't get as good an education.What if the school district has already devoted its money to reducing class size, used its local funds? What they need is better pay to keep those teachers there.On classroom funding, are we going to say: You can only use this money to hire more teachers? What if the principal said: I have some great teachers, but they are going to go into the private sector if I don't give them a pay increase? How does that make sense for us to say to every school district in the Nation: Thou shalt hire more teachers? It doesn't make sense to me.Local school districts are best equipped to determine what they need. Many have already reduced class size where they thought necessary. They might have done that at the expense of some other things: Teacher pay, technology, class books. Maybe they need professional development for the teachers they have. How do we know? I will guarantee you, we don't know. We can't know for every school district in the Nation. That is why we ought not be mandating that Federal dollars be spent for a purpose that may or may not be the top priority need of that district.Mandating specific resources for class size reduction really takes money off the table for other schools that have already addressed that specific issue. As I said earlier, they may have decided that professional development for their teachers to improve the quality of teaching is more important to obtain academic success for the students and schools.We always deal with limited budgets. There is not going to be an unlimited source of money going into anything we need. The question is how best we spend the money we have. All of us agree that a good, quality education is our top national priority. We can't say we are going to have all the specific programs and we are going to meet every need of every school district because State and local funds still cover at least 90 percent--in most States more--of education funding. We are not going to replace that. We shouldn't because we didn't run for this office to be a national school board.The President and the Secretary of Education are men deeply committed to education, but they are not good superintendents of schools or principals or even teachers, in this instance, because they have to deal with all the schools and they can't know all the kids' names.The American public is and should be interested in the debate in Washington because they overwhelmingly believe that good education for our children is a top priority. But they also know what really matters is what goes on in the schools and the classrooms around the country. As much as we like to argue among ourselves, what is said in this Chamber or even in the other body is not going to drive the education of a student or make sure that student is better educated. That depends upon a teacher and the school in which that child studies.Individuals on one side of this debate believe that the Olympians on the hill, those of us in Washington with fine titles, those of us with national responsibilities in the Congress or those in the Education Department, a group of very concerned individuals, know what is best for the folks down in the valley.I happen to be on the side who believe that the great ideas, the accomplishments, the successes that are going to make our children better educated for the future, that are going to help them meet the challenges of this wonderful but challenging century are going to be made by the folks in the valley, the men and women who staff our schools, who are the teachers, administrators, superintendents, principals who run the school boards, and who are the parents who, above all, are the ones with the greatest stake in the education of their children. I hope this body does not hijack S. 1 and make it into another system of categorical grants: Jump through this hoop and you will get some dollars. But then you will have to fill out reports and check in with Washington to see how you used them, and then you will have to file more reports, or you can jump through this hoop if you make a successful application. And if you jump through the right hoops and somebody in Washington agrees that it is OK, then you have to follow up with more reports and redtape and forms and tell them what you did. I don't think that is the way we ought to be going on education.I urge my colleagues, as we look at these amendments before us, to ask these basic questions: Is this amendment or provision going to enable somebody who is teaching children in a school in my State to do a better job? Is it going to be across the board? Is it going to enable every teacher in every school district? Or is it only going to affect a few school districts, where our priority happens to be that school's priority?Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to rethink how we are going in terms of setting up too many hoops for schools to jump through. We want to see better education, but Federal hoops are not the way to get there.I thank the Chair and yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:09:05.915752,2015-03-17 19:09:05.915752,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT,2001-05-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-14/html/CREC-2001-05-14-pt1-PgS4858-2.htm,65,31,147,S4858-S4880,B000611,mr. bond
2146,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, as a member of the conference committee, we spent nearly 6 months crafting this bill. I am pleased to rise in support of this landmark legislation which leaves no child behind.As many of my colleagues have already mentioned, this bill provides the most comprehensive education reform since 1965. I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the leader on our side, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, and the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. Their tireless work to bring this bill to the Senate has placed comprehensive education reform within reach of all students across the country.Too many children in America are segregated by low expectations, illiteracy, and self-doubt. In a constantly changing world that demands increasingly complex skills from its workforce, children are being left behind. Over the years, we have empowered the Federal Government and faceless bureaucrats while burying our educators and schools in regulation, redtape, mandates, and endless paperwork. As a result, we have disenfranchised educators and slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation at the local level.At last count, the Federal Government had 760 different education programs operating within 39 different agencies, boards, and commissions. Each was launched as a step toward reform, but each new program comes with added regulation and paperwork.By one estimate, compliance consumes 50 million hours each year, the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employees just to process the forms. Ask the teacher who has to deal with 760 programs, or the administrator who has to handle it, just how much this detailed reform and direction from Washington has helped them focus on their children. In my State they will say ``not one bit.''Today, nearly 70 percent of low-income fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level. Our high school seniors trail students of most industrialized nations on international math tests. Nearly a third of our college freshmen must take a remedial course before they are able to begin college level courses. This is why President Bush has chosen education reform as a cornerstone of his administration.This conference report reflects an agenda that President Bush outlined during his first days in office. It emphasizes flexibility, local control, accountability, literacy, and parental involvement. I am honored to have had a hand in shaping that policy. Parental involvement, early childhood, and parents as teachers are issues I have worked with a long time. I am pleased the principles of my direct check for education were included in the legislation. Over the years, I have worked with Missouri educators to develop the direct check approach to education reform, which consolidates Federal education programs, cuts Federal strings and paperwork, and sends the money directly to local school districts.Like my direct check proposal, this conference report recognizes that educational reform and progress will take place in the classrooms in America, not in Washington, DC. This report consolidates a myriad of existing Federal programs and allows States and local school districts to make decisions on their own, to determine their priorities. By reducing the mandates, as well as the costly and time-consuming paperwork that local school districts must endure to obtain Federal grants and funding, parents and teachers are empowered to take back control of educating our Nation's children.To me, the issue is simple. We must empower our States and local school districts with flexibility to utilize the limited amount of Federal resources as they best see fit to educate our children. This conference report does just that. Local schools will immediately be given the flexibility they need, where they are most needed, because a school in Joplin, MO, may have different needs than one in Hannibal, Kansas City, St. Louis, or Boonville, MO.Some schools need new teachers. Others may need new textbooks or computers, or wish to begin an after-school program.We simply cannot continue to ask teachers and local schools to meet higher expectations without empowering them with the freedom and flexibility to do the job. This legislation strikes a delicate balance. It keeps the Federal Government out of the day-to-day operations of local schools; gives States and school districts more authority and freedom; and requires performance in return.Education, while a national priority, remains a local responsibility. I believe that those who know the names of the students are better at making decisions than bureaucrats at the Department of Education. Parents, teachers, local school boards are the key to true education reform, not big government, Washington-based educational bureaucracy. In addition to giving local schools more control, I am pleased this conference report recognizes parental involvement and increases resources to our very successful Parents as Teachers Program which we hope to provide to every State in the Nation as well as foreign countries. It strengthens accountability, it provides the necessary funds to attract and retain quality teachers, and develops literacy programs to guarantee all students will be able to read by the third grade.With its emphasis on the child rather than the bureaucracy, this legislation offers an opportunity to make real progress in our schools.The great Missourian Mark Twain said: Out of public schools grows the greatness of a nation.One-sixth of the American population is enrolled in public schools. The content and quality of their education will determine the character of our country.I thank the managers of this bill for their courtesy to me as well as for their great work over the 6 months in bringing this conference report to the floor.,2015-03-17 19:09:06.182943,2015-03-17 19:09:06.182943,Senate,NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT,2001-12-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-12-18/html/CREC-2001-12-18-pt1-PgS13365-8.htm,176,68,147,S13365-S13422,B000611,mr. bond
2147,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, here we are again on another continuing resolution some 11, 12, or 13 days into the fiscal year; and we have not begun to finish our work. I am very disappointed that we come to the floor again to debate another continuing resolution simply to keep the government going. We should have had all of the appropriation bills done 12 days ago.This Republican Congress has been so busy throwing money at things, helping candidates, and our time and our energy have been so taken up by the contrived 90-10 scheme put out by the other side, that we have been unable to do our most basic work. My biggest fear is that in all of this, education, which is the most important challenge and issue facing our country, is being shortchanged. We should not be taking another full week in which we drift aimlessly and squander, as Republicans would have us do, key opportunities on education.So we are going to vote for this resolution, but we are putting the Republican leadership on notice. Until we have an opportunity to deal with education, this is the end of the line on comfortable stop-gap measures that keep the government open week by week. Democrats believe that education is priority number one, two and three.I know that many of my colleagues believe that we are talking about the bare minimum on education; much more important an agenda than we have had on any other issue. We need to give every child the time and attention they need from adults and the life opportunities they deserve. The three items that Democrats believe are the keys to education are the following: tax cuts for school construction, hiring new teachers and reducing class size, and funding key programs like after-school and Pell Grants.This is the bare minimum of what we need to do. And, unfortunately, while Republicans have been on their spending spree, coming up with false budgets to reduce the debt, education has been shoved to the side by this Congress with a set of priorities that are skewed, to say the least. We want a reasonable, bipartisan tax credit for school construction, and we want funding for emergency repairs. But Republicans are starving that priority because, while they talk about their commitment to education, they do very little to back up that commitment with the proper resources and the proper commitment to those resources.We want in Labor-HHS funding that is dedicated to hiring new qualified teachers and reducing class size. But our friends on the other side have created loopholes in the bill so big that the money could be spent for anything.Finally, as part of this first step this year, we support funding for after-school programs so that our children can get the time and attention they need to become productive, functional law-abiding citizens. Listen to this. We have over 2 million people in jail in this country. They do not pay taxes, they do not vote, they do not raise their families, they do not give to charity. They are not functional citizens. They cost us about $40,000 per person per year to hold them.At the same time, we have 2 million jobs in this country that we cannot fill. We are about to pass an H-1B law that would let more foreign immigrants come into the country to fill these high-tech jobs, and all of us support the legislation because we need to fill the jobs.The answer to those two stark contradictory facts is that we are not doing a good enough job with educating and raising our children so we prevent them from going to jail, so we get them to take these jobs and give them the education and the mental ability that they need to do it. We have to do better and we cannot wait until next year to do better. The opportunity is in front of us now, by giving our public schools and our families the resources and the incentives that they need to lift up every child.So let us stop squandering our opportunities and let us work together in a bipartisan fashion in these next few days on the most important priority for the American people. Let us get our work done, but let us do it in a bipartisan way. Let us stop spending our time on naming post offices and passing resolutions that have little import or meaning. Let us stop spending our time buying another week of time so that we can do work that we should have done 3 months ago. Let us get to work in a bipartisan way and serve the needs of the education of our children in this bill.Democrats will no longer support continuing resolutions to keep the government running for weeks on end. We will support a bipartisan education bill that finally helps the children of this country.,2015-03-17 19:09:06.316031,2015-03-17 19:09:06.316031,House,FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-10-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-12/html/CREC-2000-10-12-pt1-PgH9821-3.htm,127,7,146,H9821-H9826,G000132,mr. gephardt
2148,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Why am I opposed to national testing? Mr. President, we must remember that any movement toward national control of education savages principles that we as Americans hold dear: parental authority and control, teachers who are free to teach core subject matter and school boards that are responsive to their communities, not held captive by distant bureaucrats.President Clinton's proposal for national testing of our children is an example of such an attempt at a federal power grab. The President wants to move power out of the hands of parents and school boards and into the hands of Washington bureaucrats.America resists that for a number of important reasons, and these are the reasons to oppose federalized national tests.Parental involvement is the most important factor in a child's educational success, and national tests would undermine the ability of parents to play a meaningful role in the educational decisions of their children.During my time as Governor of Missouri, and through my work with the Education Commission of the States, learned that the single most operative condition in student educational achievement is the involvement of parents. Study after study has proven the significance of parental involvement in their child's education.We should not disengage parents with a federalized national testing system. Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in educational success.Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in educational success. As a former Governor who made education a top policy priority, I learned first-hand that local control is needed to create educational programs that respond to the needs of local communities and that stimulate success.National tests will lead to a national curriculum. There is wide consensus among teachers, administrators, and education experts that ``what gets tested is what gets taught.''So, if you determine a test, you determine the curriculum.A national curriculum is detrimental because it eliminates the participation of parents and local schools--the key elements of success. It would do so inevitably. As a result, they key elements of success--parents, schoolteachers, and local decision-making--would be missing in our educational systems throughout the country.Lynne Cheney, former Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, reminds us that previous attempts at federal standards have been disastrous.She points to the politically correct federal history standards which were unanimously rejected in the Senate.Cheney also points to the English/language arts standards, which were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having invested more than $1 million.The final exam on the Clinton plan for federally controlled testing will come on the Labor/OHS/Education appropriations bill. This Congress--and more importantly, the American people--will be watching very carefully to see how the Administration performs on this issue that affects the future of our children. I will do everything in my power to protect the ability of parents, teachers, and local schools to be involved in the education of their children by participating in the development of school curriculum, standards, and testing.So I commend this bill to the President. This is an important bill. It would advance substantially the interests of our students. I thank the sponsors for their outstanding work.I look forward to sending to the President an appropriations bill which would curtail the potential of any money being wasted at the Federal level by imposing inappropriate federalized tests upon local school districts. These tests would curtail the ability of local officials to make the kinds of decisions that are necessary for us to have the kind of school quality that we need in order to survive in the next century.With that in mind, I thank the sponsor of this legislation and commend him for the outstanding work he has done by stepping forward for America's schoolchildren, and I look forward to the opportunity of working together again to make sure that as we protect the options of parents and local officials to educate their children, we best serve this great land and future generations.I thank the Chair.Gentlemen: We are grateful to the two of you for taking the lead on requiring that testing of students remain at the state and local level. The administration's proposal to control student testing at the federal level necessarily would result in government control of the curriculum. Stopping this central government control of student testing is a very important part of our Republican plan to return our schools to the control of the parents and teachers at the local level. We have worked with you and voted with you to pass a federal testing prohibition bill in the House and to add an amendment to H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools. Obviously, since this bill is under the threat of a veto by the administration and a filibuster by Senate Democrats, it does not serve our interests to pursue the ban on federal testing in this bill. Therefore, in order to ensure that Congress will pass and send to the President a ban on federal testing, you have our commitment to support inclusion of your testing prohibition language (H.R. 2846/Amendment 2300 to H.R. 2646) in the base test of the FY 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. This language will be maintained through floor action and the conference committee process. You have our commitment that this bill will not leave the Congress without a testing provision that you find to be satisfactory. If for some reason the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill does not make it to the President's desk, then we will support efforts to include this provision in any Continuing Resolution(s), or other ``must pass'' legislation in both bodies. We appreciate your leadership over the past months on this most important issue and look forward to continuing to work closely with you. Sincerely, Trent Lott.

2149,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the issue of education for a moment and say that in my view, and I think in all Democrats' views, and I hope in many Republicans' views, education is the most important issue in front of our country. I was recently talking to some people from Silicon Valley, and they told me that they are right now unable to hire the people that they need. One executive told me he has had an ad in the paper all over the country to find people who are computer literate and can work in their plants, and he has not gotten an answer for the ad.He is now going to high schools because he needs college graduates. He is literally going to high schools and trying to find well-qualified high school students to try to draft them into his company before they can go to college. It is kind of like with basketball players that are drafted into the pros before they can go to college.I have labor unions in St. Louis that are going into the high schools and recruiting young people to come to apprenticeship programs, something that has not happened in our country, certainly in St. Louis, in probably 40 years, maybe longer. We have a 4.9 percent unemployment rate nationally. In some States we have a 2-percent unemployment rate right now tonight in June 1997.The great shortage in the country is not tax breaks for people who have done very well and are doing well. The great shortage in the country is mentally capable human beings who can take the productive jobs in our companies and create more economic growth and productivity so that our economy does even better in the future. And so the reason the President feels so strongly about these education tax cuts is they go to the heart of what is most needed in our country. And to go back to our people that we have talked about tonight, we, the kids in the middle class, kids trying to get in the middle class need tax breaks in order to go to college and to go to community college so they can get the mental capabilities, so they can be productive citizens and take these jobs that our corporations so desperately are looking for talent to fill.When the President said that he would not sign a tax bill, that does not have $35 billion of education tax cuts, he said it because of that fact. Our bill has $37 billion of tax cuts for education. The Republican bill has $22 billion of tax cuts for education. It is not going to be signed by this President because it should not be signed.Again, the No. 1 need in the country is education, education, education is what we need. And we need our tax cuts to go to people so they can get education.When I was a young person, my dad was a milk truck driver in St. Louis. We were of those lower middle income families. My mom was a secretary. Every month they would take their money and put it in a savings account so my brother and I could go to college, the first ones in our family that had been able to go to college. When we finally got into college, we had to borrow money from the church, Third Baptist Church in St. Louis.I will never forget, my mother and I went down and saw the pastor of the church and we asked for a loan. They had a little scholarship fund, and they gave us a loan so that I could pay my tuition at the university. We did not have tax cuts then. And we did not have student loans, and we did not have Pell grants then. It was a long time ago. I am getting up there. But the only way we could do it is if we go to the church and borrow the money. And tuition at Northwestern University, where I went, was $1,500 a year.What does a family today who is earning $25,000 and $20,000 and $30,000 and $17,000 do to get their child even to community college or to State college, much less a private university that might cost 5 or 10 or 20 or $30,000 a year?When we are talking about this conversation that we are having, I say to the gentlewoman from Houston, with the American people tonight, and I hope we will have over the next 48 hours, this is what is at stake. It is whether or not the kids of this country who come from middle income and lower middle income and poor working American homes will have the ability to go borrow the money and get the money together to go to college so they can be productive citizens. That is what is at stake.There are not enough churches out there to do what happened to me. I hope there are some and I hope they can give loans to kids like I got a loan, but I am sure that there are not enough out there to get this done.This is a big deal. It is a big deal for the future of the American economy and the American people. I hope and pray that we can get this point across to the American people in these next 48 hours, and they will stay tuned in, as the gentlewoman from Houston has said, and that we will get their attention and they will respond. They will pick up the phone and they will write or they will send e-mail or they will send a letter or they will go to the office of their Congressperson, whether they are Republican or Democrat and say, we want a tax bill that helps average families and helps education and really helps the future of this country.I thank the gentleman.,2015-03-17 19:09:06.726321,2015-03-17 19:09:06.726321,House,DEMOCRATIC TAX CUT PROPOSAL,1997-06-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-24/html/CREC-1997-06-24-pt1-PgH4314.htm,90,19,143,H4314-H4320,G000132,mr. gephardt
2150,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prohibit the Federal Government from developing and/or imposing new national individualized tests on students across the country.During his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton announced his intentions to establish national tests for students in fourth grade reading and eighth grade mathematics. Without waiting for congressional authority, the Department of Education surged ahead and began development of uniform national tests, with plans to administer them starting in 1999. In August, the Department announced the award of a $13 million contract for its national testing initiative, and plans to spend an estimated $50.6 million under the contract from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2001, including $12.3 million for fiscal year 1998.In response, Representative Bill Goodling, chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, offered an amendment in the House which prohibits the expenditure of fiscal year 1998 funds for a new national testing program. While the Senate failed to consider fully and vote on the Goodling approach during its debate of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the House embraced the Goodling amendment, approving it by a resounding vote of 295 to 125.The House vote sends a clear and strong signal that Congress should prohibit Federal funds for national testing in education. In fact, the alliance of members from both sides of the political spectrum demonstrates the universal concern that the administration's proposal is besieged by problems. Here are just a few of the many reasons why national tests should be opposed:First, education experts such as Dr. Donald J. Senese, former Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement during the Reagan administration, warn that national testing will lead to a national curriculum.Second, Lynne Cheney, former chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, reminds us that Federal efforts to set standards and tests have been disastrous. She points to the politically correct Federal history standards and the English-language arts standards, which were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having spent more than $1 million in taxpayer funds.Third, the proposed math test is steeped in the new, unproven whole math or fuzzy math philosophy, which encourages students to rely on calculators, discourages basic math skills, and has resulted in declines in math performance. For example, the median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 DODDS students one year after the Defense Department introduced whole math dropped 9 points for third graders, 12 for fourth graders, 11 for fifth graders, 10 for sixth graders, 10 for seventh graders, and 4 for eighth graders.Finally, Federal testing takes away local control and parental involvement. The Federal Government should not impose its will on school boards, parents, and teachers about the education of their children. Rather, education should be controlled by school boards in local communities, where parents have the greatest opportunity to be involved in the education of their child, by participating in the development of school curriculum and testing. After all, research confirms that parental involvement is the single most important element in educating our children.Mr. President, the big losers from national tests will be students, parents, teachers, and local school boards. Once Federal exams are in place, teachers and schools will teach the test. In other words, they will change their classes to fit the Federal tests, in order to get higher scores. Textbooks and instructional materials will follow suit, even in areas that attempt to avoid national tests. As a result, Washington bureaucrats who design the tests will shape local curriculum decisions. National control of curriculum is absolutely unacceptable to me. Once the Federal Government is using tests to shape curriculum, parental control through local school boards will be doomed.Who should control local education? I believe our schools should remain under the control of parents, teachers, and school boards, in cooperation with the States. The flawed whole math approach which brought major losses in computation test scores demonstrates the central threat in national control: When the bureaucrats make a mistake, everybody pays, from coast to coast.Parents are looking to Congress to protect their right and their ability to shape the education of their children. A national testing system would deprive parents of this vital opportunity. As Members of Congress, we can show our support for education by saying ``no'' to national testing and ``yes'' to parental control of their children's learning.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:09:06.862419,2015-03-17 19:09:06.862419,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1997-09-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-24/html/CREC-1997-09-24-pt1-PgS9887.htm,129,393,143,S9887-S9897,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2151,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the Democratic Leadership Substitute and in opposition to the Republican Budget, H. Con. Res. 393, which fails to meet the fiscal and societal challenges Americans face today. While the Republican budget focuses on a tax cut for only a few, slashes important funding for health care, veterans, education and environmental programs, and does little to revive the economy, the Democratic plan is a fiscally responsible solution to balance the budget, reign in the deficit, fund priorities, and promote job creation and economic growth.The Democratic Leadership Substitute achieves a balanced federal budget within eight years and invests in meaningful job creation, education, veterans benefits, environmental protection, infrastructure and economic development.Since 2001, the economy has lost more than 3 million private sector jobs. In the Kansas City Metropolitan Area in the past three years, 21,300 jobs have been lost. The Republican proposal we are considering today continues the Administration's same failed economic policies, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has concluded will have, at best, a small impact on the economy over the next five years. Alternatively, the Democratic substitute promotes job creation by restoring funding to small business loan programs, job training and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program. Additionally, it extends temporary federal unemployment benefits for workers looking for jobs and extended tax cuts, such as the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief.The Republican budget does not adequately fund our nation's top priority: homeland security. Of particular concern is its failure to fully fund our first responders including police, firefighters, and emergency medical service technicians. Federal funds for first responders is a top concern in my district and across the country, and the Democratic substitute ensures these needs by providing $5 billion in additional funding over the next five years. As a member of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, I support adequate funding for state and local governments to prevent and prepare for any type of terrorist threat.The Democratic budget also restores funding to important veterans programs that the Republican resolution cuts. It provides the full funding level, $32.3 billion, requested for 2005 by the Committee on Veterans Affairs. Additionally, it includes $6.6 billion more than the Republican budget over the next five years for critical health needs.The Republican budget resolution shortchanges authorized education programs by approximately $9 billion just as many costly federal mandates, such as annual testing and highly qualified teacher requirements, will take effect. It is unacceptable to impose federal mandates on the states without the funding necessary to fulfill them. As a formal teacher, I understand how important education is to the future of our children. The Republican budget also proposes the smallest overall increase for education programs in nine years. Additionally, it falls further behind on fully funding special education by proposing only a 0.5 percent increase in funding. Finally, it freezes Pell Grant funding, making college unaffordable for millions of low income students. Alternatively, the Democratic substitute provides $9.8 billion more for education and training programs over the next five years. It also restores $3.7 billion for Pell grants and additional funding to make college loans more affordable.The federal budget resolution must fulfill the priorities of the American people. It must be fiscally responsible in ensuring our security, providing adequate funding for domestic programs, putting Americans back to work and balancing the budget. With passage of the Democratic Leadership Substitute, we can work together to put the priorities of the American people first.Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget resolution fails to meet the fiscal challenges Americans face today and slashes programs that are their lifeline. I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic substitute as a more realistic budgetary solution that funds programs essential to those who seek the American dream.,2015-03-17 19:09:06.993519,2015-03-17 19:09:06.993519,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005,2004-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-25/html/CREC-2004-03-25-pt1-PgH1495-2.htm,39,232,150,H1495-H1565,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2152,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today--at least a few moments are justified--in offering some words to help the Nation celebrate the Brown v. Board of Education decision that occurred 50 years ago. It is a good thing we remember and honor that decision. That case was the culmination of a strategy by the NAACP and others that attacked racial segregation at its heart and, by the way, also a decision that redeemed the Supreme Court's record in cases of this kind because we should not forget the Court had earlier placed its imprimatur on slavery in 1856 in the Dred Scott decision and had subsequently placed its imprimatur on the Jim Crow decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. It was, indeed, time in 1954 for the Supreme Court to stand up for the Constitution and live up to the promises of the Declaration of Independence, specifically the promise that all of us are created equal, at least in this sense: that we are equal in our right to enjoy the inalienable rights that Almighty God gives us simply by virtue of the fact that we are people and have human dignity.The history of the United States is, in one sense, a history of a progressive realization of that promise that in fact had been made in theory in the Declaration and also an understanding by the American people that unless that promise is realized and enjoyed by everybody, it is secure for nobody. Brown v. Board of Education was a milestone in that realization.I do want to make the point that the Supreme Court's decision in Brown was not an isolated act of courage by nine Justices, although it was certainly a courageous decision. It was, as I said before, the culmination of a strategy by the NAACP, but also years of advocacy by that group and other groups around the country and thousands of Americans on their own who refused to accept the assumptions underlying racial segregation and, indeed, refused to let the American people go on year after year quietly and in an unthinking way accepting those assumptions.That activity by thousands and thousands of people in protests, in op-ed pieces, in books they wrote, in appearances on mass media, and just the way they conducted their day-to-day lives changed public opinion, by no means entirely in 1954 but enough so that the Brown v. Board of Education decision became possible, in a way that it would not have been possible--clearly was not possible in 1934 or even 1944.The same Supreme Court, staffed by the same nine Justices, would not and did not issue a decision such as Brown v. Board of Education 20 years earlier or 10 years earlier because those people had not yet done enough of their work to move enough of the American people toward the right conclusion that that decision became possible.In that sense, I suggest that people such as Jackie Robinson and others around the country probably did more to desegregate the schools than the Supreme Court did in Brown v. Board of Education, and certainly people such as Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King did more to ensure the implementation in practice of the Brown v. Board of Education than the Federal courts did.I want to dedicate this day on which we justly celebrate the decision to the thousands of people, some who are recorded in history and some who have remained anonymous, who made that decision possible and helped correct a tremendous injustice and redeem America's honor before the bar of history.The Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, changed laws, and that is hard, as we know in the Senate.Those other folks, in standing up for the rights of their fellow citizens, changed hearts, and that is even more difficult.,2015-03-17 19:09:07.126613,2015-03-17 19:09:07.126613,Senate,BROWN V.

2153,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I have been listening with a great deal of interest as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed their views on education. I particularly commend my neighbor and colleague from Kansas and my good friend from Idaho for their very perceptive comments about education.As I listen to the debate back and forth, it is clear we have two very different approaches to education being championed. On the one side, we have trust of local schools; on the other side, we have mistrust.On one side, we advocate local control; on the other side, they advocate Federal control.On our side, we say that parents, schools, teachers, and school boards know best. On the other side, they say Washington knows best.For me it is not a tough choice. This is not rocket science: trust, local control, parents, schools know best. There is no question in my mind.I come to the Senate floor today to say--and I have said it before and I will say it again--I spent my adult career working with parents, teachers, and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I have watched their education decisions. I spent the last 13 years in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal bureaucracy administer programs.When it comes to wasting money, it is not even close. It is not a contest. It is a good thing that local schools do not operate as does the Federal Government because local schools could not afford to. Luckily, schools are far better at applying resources to the needs of children in their schools. Unfortunately, the Federal bureaucracy has been good at creating waste, misdirected priorities, red tape, and unnecessary hassles and regulations.As it is the case in other areas as well, our congressional zest to provide assistance has become part of the problem--our good intentions. And they are good intentions. Nobody questions the intentions. When the Congress went about creating 765 programs, every single one of them was a good idea. Unfortunately, it was at the wrong place. It was a good idea in Washington, not a good idea at the local school level.Our good intentions have become burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, mounds of paperwork, and unwanted meddling. We have created a system where parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom.Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials, we have empowered the Federal Government and the bureaucrats. We have been slowly eroding the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have put a system in place where the Olympians on the hill pretend to know what is best for the peasants in the valley.We need to be bold enough to stand up and admit that these good intentions have gone astray. Our good intentions are failing our public schools and, most importantly, they are failing our children. Let's recognize what we do not know in Washington has become obvious. Washington does not always know best, especially when it comes to micromanaging the education of children in local schools throughout this country.What is wrong with giving control of education to local schools and to the States? What happened to everyone saying that education is a national priority but a local responsibility? I firmly believe that is true. If that were true, and the other side trusted those at the local level, this debate would not be as controversial as it is.What is wrong with letting classroom teachers, principals, and school boards fashion plans to improve learning and achievement in their own schools?Back in my home State of Missouri, no one thinks the answer to improving public education lies within the Halls of Congress or in the granite buildings in downtown Washington's Department of Education.Almost everyone I have talked to will say: Stay out of the way and give the local schools the opportunity.Missourians know, and I know, that the real solutions--the laboratories--are the local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not have to play the ``Mother, May I'' game with Washington, DC.My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep talking about class size, afterschool programs, and numerous other programs. These will be new programs, with new mandates, and new responsibilities for schools directly controlled and regulated by Washington, smothered with reports and regulations and redtape. Is this the direction we want to go? I do not think so. This will only exacerbate the ``Mother, May I'' game.As we debate ESEA today, I hope we will keep certain things in perspective. One of those things is how much money the Federal Government actually provides to the local school district and what amount of Federal involvement is appropriate with the amount of funding provided.I have heard over and over again that the Federal Government provides less than 10 percent of a local school district's budget. Yet the Federal Government accounts for over 50 percent of the local school district's paperwork burden. How can any of us justify this proportion of Federal meddling and paperwork burden for less than 10 percent of the district's funding? In my State of Missouri, on average, Federal funding accounts for only 6 percent of the local school district's budget.My great State of Missouri has some wonderful teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members--some of the best in the country. I cannot believe my colleagues are not hearing the same thing from their constituents that I am hearing from mine. If you are not, I suggest you are not listening. Go back and ask them. They will tell you. However, just in case you have not heard, let me share some of the things I have been told.The Superintendent of Springfield Public Schools in Missouri said:The amount of paperwork that the federal government causes local school districts to engage in is often overwhelming. That extra effort and time often reduces productive classroom time and energy that could better be spent working directly with children.Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV School in Missouri said:Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had in mind.From Neosho R-5, in Missouri:The individuals working most closely with the students are indeed the ones who can best decide how this money can be spent for the benefit of students' education.From the Superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County, MO:As head of a school district specializing in special education, I fully understand how my district's financial needs differ from other school districts' needs. In order to best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those funds to the best use.From the Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School District in Missouri:Without local control, the focus is taken away from the needs specific to the children in each school system.I think the Superintendent of the Taneyville R-II School District in Missouri sums it up well:I feel that the State and Federal government has tied our school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school does this; pull it another way and the school does that. School systems and communities are as different from one another as individual people are different. What works for one will not work for another.These are the types of comments I have heard over the past couple years. These comments led to the development of my Direct Check for Education proposal that is S. 52.As introduced, S. 52 took six Department of Education programs, primarily competitive grant programs, and combined them and determined that the funding would go out based on average daily attendance in school districts. It would give school districts added flexibility.I intend to offer an amendment that would allow us to try this as a demonstration program.I know it is hard sometimes to get Governors to support this concept. But I stand here as a recovering Governor. I know that Governors and States have the responsibility for welfare programs, State transportation programs; but the responsibility for directly delivering student education rests in the hands of those at the local level.Let's give them the opportunity to demonstrate they can deliver. States can still establish standards and requirements. They still have the ability to control their local school districts. What I am saying, with Direct Check, is to keep their hands out of the bureaucratic maze that the Federal Government imposes on them. I hope my colleagues will take a look at that proposal when I offer it.Another area I am looking at very carefully is having an amendment on Impact Aid. Impact Aid is one of the oldest Federal education programs, dating from the 1950s, and is meant to compensate local school districts for the ``substantial and continuing financial burdens'' resulting from Federal activities. These ``activities'' include Federal ownership of land, such as military installations or Indian reservation lands, as well as local school enrollment of children whose parents work on Federal property. It is a Federal responsibility.In my State, we have two outstanding military bases: Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base. I would argue it is a quality-of-life issue for our military and one we must address. I look forward to working on it with my colleagues. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma will be working on it.I also offer my support, in advance, for an amendment I have been working on for some time with Senators Stevens and Jeffords, along with a number of our other colleagues, that focuses on early childhood education and development.While most of the debate this week will be about elementary and secondary education--the years of what we might call ``formal schooling''--the education and mental development of a child, however, begins long before that child enters kindergarten. In fact, the education and development of a child begins practically at birth. From the experiences we have had in Missouri with parents and teachers, we know that those first 3 years are vitally important. Giving the parents the right tools to help that child get started can make a tremendously important difference in the educational achievement of that child throughout that child's educational experience.The amendment the Senators from Vermont and Alaska will offer recognizes these basic facts; that the education and mental development and entire development of a child begins early in life. Through this amendment, we hope to support families with the youngest children to find the early childhood educational programs that can help those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children need.The amendment recognizes that if we want to do everything possible for our Nation's children and their overall education, we need to focus on the earliest years, as well as the years of formal schooling. We can do this--and this amendment proposes to do this--by supporting and expanding the successful early childhood programs and initiatives that are working right now at the local level. I invite anybody to come to Missouri to see how well these programs work.I am pleased to say the amendment is based on the basic ideas and principles set forth in legislation that I was pleased to introduce several years ago with my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.Mr. President, it is my opinion that if we want to improve our public education system to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement, we must take the stranglehold of the Federal Government off the local school districts and the States and give the resources directly to those local school districts and States so they can do their job.I look forward to supporting an amendment by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, which deals with some of the very serious problems that the current IDEA imposes. Talk to any school official, any schoolteacher, any school personnel in Missouri, and they will tell you they are scared because the requirements of IDEA put other students, teachers, and school personnel at risk from dangerously violent students who sometimes carry guns and are sheltered by the Federal regulations that come with the individual education program. We should not have a Federal Government program that puts people associated with schools at risk. We need to change the laws to protect and nurture those with IEPs but not to expose those with whom they deal to violence and perhaps even to guns.In closing, we must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, and school boards because education decisions can best be made by educators, board members, parents, teachers, and local school officials who know the names and the needs of the children in their schools. I hope we will be spending our time debating education, not every issue under the Sun that may come up as an effort to derail this vitally important reform of our education system.Our children deserve the reform this bill delivers. This ESEA bill deals with one of the most important national priorities, and that is education. It deals with it by moving the control and the responsibility out of Washington and back into the real world where the best decisions can be made. I look forward to working with my colleagues.I thank the floor manager, the chairman of the committee, for allowing me the extra time. I look forward to continuing the debate and working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve successful ESEA reform, with perhaps some of the bells and whistles added that I have mentioned.

2154,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to honor the new Lincoln University President, Dr. David B. Henson. On April 4, 1998, Dr. Henson will gather with friends, family, colleagues, faculty, and students to be inaugurated as the seventeenth President of Lincoln University which opened its doors on September 17, 1866, in Jefferson City, Missouri as the Lincoln Institute.Dr. Henson has a twenty-five year history of service to higher education. The list of educational institutions he has served is a prestigious one. At Howard University College of Medicine, Dr. Henson served as the Acting Chairperson in the Department of Biochemistry, the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, and an Associate Professor of Biochemistry. At Yale College, he was the Dean of Student Affairs and the Associate Dean. Dr. Henson's work in the fields of science is commendable. He was a Lecturer in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and a Fellow in Timothy Dwight College at Yale University, a Professor of Chemistry at Alabama A&amp;M, and a Provost and Professor of Chemistry at the Broward Campus of Florida Atlantic University. Furthermore, at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Dr. Henson held the position of Associate Vice Chancellor of Academic Services and Student Support Services. Dr. Henson also served as Vice President of Student Services at Purdue University.President Henson is actively involved in state and local community services. He is an honorary member of Purdue Iron Key Society; a member of the Executive 21 Continuous Quality Improvement Steering Committee; a steward at St. John's AME Church in Huntsville; on the National Committee on International Science and Education; on the Education Committee, U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center; and on the Board of Huntsville Boy's and Girl's Clubs of America.Dr. Henson contributes his services to Missouri organizations as well. He currently is the Treasurer of the Council on Public Higher Education of Missouri; on the Board of Directors with the Jefferson Chamber of Commerce; on the Board of Governors at Capital Region Medical Canter; a member of the Steering Committee for the River Rendezvous; an active member of the Rotary Club of Jefferson City; and a member of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Central Missouri Celebration Planning Committee.To his credit, Dr. Henson has received the African Americans Who Make a Difference Award, the Howard University College of Medicine Student Council's Award for Excellence in Teaching, the George Washington Carver Research Foundation Student Award, and an American Council on Education Fellowship.For this lifetime of service to education and commitment to community involvement, I rise today to recognize and salute Dr. David B. Henson as he becomes the seventeenth President of Lincoln University. I think I speak for all Missourians when I say that we are grateful that he has chosen a Missouri university to continue his service to higher education.,2015-03-17 19:09:07.493874,2015-03-17 19:09:07.493874,Senate,HONORING DR.

HENSON, THE SEVENTEENTH PRESIDENT OF LINCOLN UNIVERSITY,1998-03-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-30/html/CREC-1998-03-30-pt1-PgS2763-3.htm,38,0,144,S2763-S2764,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2155,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, if the National Endowment for the Arts is terminated and a State block grant is enacted, local communities will suffer tremendous losses, educationally, culturally and economically. Under the block grant, less than $50 million would be directed to the States for school-based art education programs. Currently, there are approximately 51 million students enrolled in primary and secondary schools. Thus, under the block grant each child would receive less than $1 for arts education activities. Dispensing funds in such piddling amounts is tantamount to throwing that money away.During its 31-year history, the NEA has fostered the placement of thousands of artists-in-residence in our public schools and has allowed for the creation of literacy programs and children's festivals. In partnership with the Department of Education, the NEA assists over 100 national arts and education organizations to implement arts education in the curriculum. The NEA has also assisted universities in providing training for teachers and faculty, including national research on the effects of arts education on cognitive learning. The block grant would eliminate funding to universities, as well as lifelong learning programs that serve our Nation's adults, senior citizens, and disabled citizens.In addition to improved quality of life and education, the NEA has made a very positive contribution to our Nation's economy. Through grants to orchestras, theaters, music ensembles, and other cultural festivals, the arts industry has supported nearly a million jobs across the Nation. In turn, these jobs have resulted in billions of dollars in revenue to the Federal Government. Local economies have seen the benefits of the arts through increased hotel stays and increased sales in local restaurants and shops.Supporters of the block grant of Federal arts funding argue that it allows more equitable funding to all congressional districts. This is simply untrue. Under the Ehlers funding formula, funds to State arts agencies would be cut below the fiscal year 1997 level, which was already reduce 40 percent under the fiscal year 1996 budget cut. It is unlikely that these limited State funds will actually reach local programs, particularly in the Nation's poorest and most isolated counties. NEA programs, such as Chamber Music Rural Residences--that have brought chamber music and jazz ensembles to rural areas, including Tifton, GA, Jesup, IA, and Blytheville, AR--would be eliminated. A block grant would likely neglect those art and culture groups that have been historically underserved, groups such as the native American woodcarvers and the black American dance troupes.The NEA has brought art to people in small towns and rural areas throughout the United States. The NEA has helped to educate and enlighten the young and the old. The NEA has enriched urban and rural communities across this country, financially as well as culturally.The Ehlers amendment makes no effort to promote effective development of, and access to, the arts. The Ehlers amendment does not endeavor to make effective use of scarce Federal resources. Rather, to please a fringe group that regard art as synonymous with sin, the Ehlers amendment would scatter those funds to the winds in amounts too small to make a difference. I urge rejection to the Ehlers approach.,2015-03-17 19:09:07.627969,2015-03-17 19:09:07.627969,House,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-07-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-07-15/html/CREC-1997-07-15-pt1-PgH5266.htm,100,5,143,H5266-H5272,C000488,mr. clay
2156,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to extreme Republican anti-labor riders in this legislation.I had thought the radical House Republicans had learned their lesson last year, when the legislative riders that they added to appropriations bills led to two government shutdowns. Here they go again, with two special interest provisions designed to weaken an agency that protects both working Americans and, ironically, many employees.To start with, this bill already imposes a draconian cut in the budget of the National Labor Relations Board--a fifteen percent cut from the current level, and a twenty percent cut from the President's request. Cuts of these magnitude will only result in increasingly growing backlogs--backlogs that are in the interest of neither employees nor employers. But the special interests served by this bill don't care.The first rider would prohibit the issuance of a final single location bargaining unit rule by the NLRB. But if Republicans were true to their principles, they would be supporting, not opposing, the issuance of a final rule.Indeed, such a rule, by minimizing the need for case-by-case adjudication, would reduce expensive litigation and resultant delay. This would promote certainty, for the benefit for both labor and management. In addition, a rule would promote the more efficient use of Board resources, a crucial consideration in light of the drastic cuts in the Board's budget proposed in this bill. By opposing such a rule, the Republican are showing their hypocrisy.The second rider would effectively force the NLRB to raise its business volume threshold for exercising jurisdiction over labor disputes. This is a major policy change that should not be adopted in haste on an appropriations bill.Ironically, this change would not necessarily reduce the NLRB's workload, since jurisdiction would become an issue in many more cases.Indeed, this rider shows how blind the sponsors are to the role and function of the Labor Board. The NLRB is a referee that maintains the rules of the game for both labor and management. It protects both employees and employers. The supporters of this amendment want to take away the NLRB's jurisdiction over smaller employers and restore the law of the jungle.Is this really what the supporters of this rider want to see--the law of the jungle? Do the supporters of this rider really want to decrease protections for small employers? That's what this rider would do. Perhaps that's why both labor and management experts oppose this rider.These riders are just another example of the extreme anti-labor animus of the House Republican leadership. They don't care about the facts, they don't care about the law, they don't care about the procedure, they just know they hate labor.Let's strike these extreme riders from this bill. Let's help prevent another government shutdown.Ms. ESHOO, Mr. Chairman, the shortsightedness of this bill should be obvious to us all. Inadequate funding for education compromises our children's future and the future of our nation.Listen carefully to what's not being funded:Compensatory Education--$475 million less.Safe &amp; Drug Free Schools--$99 million less.Special Education--$306 million less.Bilingual Education--$94 million less.Goals 2000--eliminated.Mr. Chairman, one cannot cut these programs without serious ramifications. Funding for education is an investment that we can and must make a priority.I return to my district every weekend and one of the issues I consistently hear from my constituents about is the importance of education. Education is the very foundation upon which our nation is built and it is what will determine the very future of our citizenry and our country.I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to oppose this shortsighted bill.,2015-03-17 19:09:07.851122,2015-03-17 19:09:07.851122,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997,1996-07-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-11/html/CREC-1996-07-11-pt1-PgH7327-3.htm,102,391,142,H7327-H7374,C000488,mr. clay
2157,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an original cosponsor with Senator Bob Kerrey of the ``Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998.'' This bill seeks to address an unintended inequity in federal support for graduate medical education. If not addressed, this inequity will jeopardize the future of the pediatric health care work force as well as the pediatric biomedical research enterprise for our nation's children.Specifically, this bill will provide capped, time-limited, interim commensurate federal funding for the nearly 60 independent children's teaching hospitals, including the children's hospitals in Kansas City and St. Louis, which are so important to the training of the nation's physicians who serve children. They are equally important to the conduct of research to benefit children's health and health care.Let me illustrate the magnitude of the inequity in federal investment in graduate medical attention (GME). In 1977, the federal Medicare program reimbursed teaching hospitals, on average, more than $76,000 for each resident trained. In contrast, Medicare reimbursed independent children's teaching hospitals--children's hospitals that do not share a Medicare provider number with a larger medical institution--less than $400 per resident, because children's hospitals care for children, not the elderly, and therefore do not serve Medicare patients, except for a small number of children with end stage renal disease.Until recently, this inequity was not a problem as long as all payers of health care were willing to reimburse teaching hospitals enough for their patient care to cover the extra costs of GME. As the health care market has become increasingly competitive, it has become harder and harder for all teaching hospitals to generate patient care revenues to help cover their GME costs. But only independent children's teaching hospitals face these competitive pressures without the significant federal GME support, which the rest of the teaching hospital community relies upon.This is more than a problem for the financial well-being of the education programs of a small number of children's hospitals--less than one percent of the nation's hospitals. It is a problem for our entire pediatric workforce and pediatric research enterprise, because these institutions play such a disproportionately large role in academic medicine for children. On average, their education programs are equal in size to the GME programs of all teaching hospitals, but they train twice as many residents per bed as do other teaching hospitals.As a consequence, independent children's teaching hospitals train about 5 percent of all physicians, 25 percent of all pediatricians, and the majority of many pediatric subspecialists who care for children with the most complex conditions, such as children with cancer, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, and more.Recommendations to address the inequity in federal GME support for children's teaching hospitals are supported by the National Association of Children's Hospitals as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs. Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote to President Clinton, to express support for the establishment of interim federal support for the GME program of freestanding, independent children's hospitals. The AAP said, ``(w)e regard the education programs of independent children's hospitals as important to our pediatric workforce and therefore to the future health of all children, because they educate an important proportion of the nation's pediatricians.''Last year, many members of the Senate, including myself, recommended that any comprehensive reform of graduate medical education financing should include commensurate federal GME support for children's teaching hospitals. Instead of enacting GME reform, Congress directed the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission to prepare recommendations for the future of GME financing, including for children's teaching hospitals.Since it will be at least another year before Congress receives those recommendations and potentially several years before Congress is able to act on them, the ``Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act'' will provide interim funding for just four years. It will be commensurate to federal GME support for all teaching hospitals. Specifically, the bill provides, in a capped fund, $100 million in FY 1999 and $285 million in each of the three succeeding fiscal years, for eligible institutions. It will be financed by general revenues, not Medicare HI Trust Funds.I know what a critical role children's hospitals play in the ability of families and communities to care for all children, including children with the most complex conditions and children on families with the most limited economic means. Through their education and research programs, they are also devoted to serving future generations of children, too. Certainly, the children of Missouri as well as Kansas and Southern Illinois, depend vitally on the services and research of independent children's teaching hospitals such as Children's Mercy in Kansas City, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, and the care givers they educate.Children's hospitals are places of daily miracles. Healing that we would never have thought possible a few years ago for children who are burn victims, or trauma victims, or even cancer victims now occurs daily at these hospitals. And while I am sure divine intervention plays a role in this healing, it is also due to the very hard work of skilled doctors, nurses, and dedicated staff that is second to none. We must therefore ensure that these facilities have the resources to continue their noble mission of saving children from the clutches of death and disease.I know trustees, and medical and executive leaders of these institutions. All are committed to controlling the cost of children's health to the best of their ability. But their future ability to sustain their education and research programs will also depend on commensurate federal GME support for them. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the enactment of the ``Children's Hospital Education and Research Act.'',2015-03-17 19:09:07.972209,2015-03-17 19:09:07.972209,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1998-05-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-07/html/CREC-1998-05-07-pt1-PgS4528-4.htm,56,13,144,S4528-S4538,B000611,mr. bond
2158,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come back to the floor to talk about Ed-Flex and the importance of that measure for the good education of our kids, and that is what we ought to be talking about.We heard a lot of posturing. Everybody thinks the ideas that come out of Washington are great. Frankly, listening to some of the ideas, I think those are good ideas. If we were a great big United States school board, if we were making the decisions, if we had the responsibility and the authority of making decisions for educating our kids, these might be ideas we would adopt. In any event, they are good ideas to be talking about.There is a real disconnect, and that is what the Ed-Flex measure begins to address. I sincerely hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will let us have a vote on this very, very important bill. We need to move on. There are a lot more things we need to do in education beyond this.I am going to have a very radical proposal to get the Federal Government strings off local education all the way. But I think Ed-Flex is a good bipartisan start, and it builds on a successful example that has been tried in 12 States. It is working. It is working because it gives the flexibility to local school districts to decide how they wish to use the money.The people in the local schools--the school board members, the teachers, the administrators, the parents--know the names of the kids. They know Joe and Sally and Harry and Willie and Thelma and the kids who are being educated in that school district. They know what their challenges are. Some of the good ideas we have in Washington may not work in a particular school district. It may not be the right recipe. Who better to make the decision than the people who know the children, who know their potential, who know their problems?I have found in meetings with educators and parents in every section of this State--in the metropolitan areas, in the urban schools, in the suburban schools, in the rural schools, in the big school districts and the small school districts--that there is one theme that has become a recurring and a growing crescendo. It is: The Federal camel's nose is under the education tent, and it is not doing good things. It is taking time away from the task of educating the kids. When a teacher has to spend hours writing a grant or a principal has to spend time to figure out if they are doing things the way the bureaucrats in Washington want them, he or she is not worrying about what is good for educating Sally or Tommy or Ralph or Cheryl or the kids who are actually getting educated.I am very fortunate, my son is finishing up high school. We watched during his education; we wanted to know what was going on in the classroom, how was he working with his teacher. We as parents knew that. The people who run the local schools know that, but those coming up with great ideas in Washington have no idea of the names of the kids or what their problems are.I thought maybe it would help my colleagues if I shared a few of the stories we are getting from schools in our State. These are smaller schools. It does not matter what the size of the school is, the child who is in that school is just as important whether she or he is in a major metropolitan school district or in a small rural district.Here is a letter from the superintendent of the Bismarck R-V School District. In part it says:. . . In our small school of 700 students, we receive less than $15,000 in the combination of Title II, Title IV and Title VI funds. The restrictions on these funds make them very difficult to deal with for such a small amount of dollars. Some years we consider not using them, simply because the time and effort are not worth the small amount we receive. Removal of some or all of the restrictions would allow us to use the funding to better meet the needs of our school instead of spending the funds in the very restrictive designated areas of Federal funding.Signed, Donald E. Francis, Superintendent, Bismarck R-V Schools.North Mercer District R-3 Public Schools:. . . As the system now works we are overwhelmed by federal and state forms and regulations. We also sacrifice many dollars to support federal and state bureaucracies that compound the forms, rules and regulations. We encountered one program this school year with in excess of 150 pages of instructions. We would like to bring dollar, services and equipment directly to children for their educational benefit.And one more. The Webb City School District R-7:. . . Those of us who have spent a career in education have repeatedly experienced the jubilation of anticipation that arose from promises made by the Federal Government toward education. Unfortunately, however, excitement was then always tempered by the reality of the red tape that accompanied the promise. As the result, frustration was generally the only product forthcoming.Signed, Ronald Lankford, Superintendent of Schools, Webb City School District R-7.Mr. President, that is just a very small sample of the kind of response we are getting from our schools. I challenge any one of you here, any one of our colleagues, to go home and ask the educators who have the job--it is a wonderful opportunity, it is the most important job that we have in this country--of educating our students: Are the 763 different Federal education programs we have right now improving education? I get an overwhelming no. We have to worry about the Washington bureaucracy rather than the needs of the kids in our classrooms.This reality has been recognized. The Nation's Governors--Democrat, Republican, and Independent--50 to 0, said, ``We want to expand Ed-Flex; we want the opportunity in all of the schools in this country to get rid of and cut away some of the bureaucracy and some of the redtape and put that money directly back to education.''There is bipartisan support for this bill. The bill has been supported by the President, by the Secretary of Education, both of whom were former Governors. I am a former Governor. I served with both of them, and we know the importance of education. But the decisions on how we spend the last dollar of Federal aid are not best made here, they are best made at the local school district level.I really hope we can move forward and get this money directly to the schools, giving them the flexibility to use those funds where they are most needed. I urge our colleagues to allow us to do so and pass this bill and go on to the many other important issues involving education that we will be facing later this year.Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:09:08.275429,2015-03-17 19:09:08.275429,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT,1999-03-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-09/html/CREC-1999-03-09-pt1-PgS2448.htm,37,10,145,S2448-S2453,B000611,mr. bond
2159,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume; and I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) for her support for this very, very important bill and thank her for her keen interest in professional military education.I rise today to support H.R. 1490, which would award a masters of science degree to the officers who complete the Joint Advanced Warfighting School at the Joint Forces Staff College. As the gentlewoman from Virginia noted, this bill will give the Department of Defense the authority to award graduates of the Joint Advanced Warfighting School their masters-level degrees. I also urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill.It is important that Congress pass the bill and the President sign it so that we can present those men and women with the accolades that they have earned when the first class of that program graduates this coming Thursday at 9 o'clock in the morning. Madam Speaker, as my colleagues know, I have spent a great deal of my career promoting the need for a rigorous program of joint professional education. We have two missions as I see it: to fight the war that we are fighting today and to prepare for the next. It was the professional military education system that sustained the warfighting competency during the lean years between the First World War and Second World War. Men like General Troy Middleton, who went on to command an Army corps during the Battle of the Bulge, spent years and years in the school system studying the art and science of war. Warfare is becoming more complex at lower and lower levels, and our professional military education system must continue to evolve to develop the thinking warriors the future will require.The Joint Advanced Warfighting School, or JAWS as it is called, at the Joint Forces Staff College is a wonderful example of how joint professional military education has grown to meet the new and unique challenges military professionals face. This first class of JAWS has given its graduates the tools to be able to create campaign-quality concepts, employ all elements of national power, and succeed as joint force operational and strategic level planners as well and commanders. These graduates will populate the Joint Staff and Combatant commands with officers expert in the joint planning processes and capable of critical analysis in the application of all aspects of national power across the full range of military operations.The student of the JAWS program have spent the past year immersed in a rigorous course of study. They have completed a curriculum focused on ``high end'' operational art consisting of courses such as Foundations in Theory of War, Strategic Foundations, and Operational Art and Campaigning, all of which blend theory foundations and historical evidence to provide them with a developmental framework. They have honed their decision-making, problem-solving, and planning skills using seminar exercises, war games, as well as simulations.Additionally, the JAWS course included several field research trips. The students participated in a comprehensive historical staff ride to Gettysburg, for example. They also traveled here to Washington and spent a week with senior military and governmental policymakers as well as practitioners.Madam Speaker, I am sure my colleagues will agree that joint professional military education is so very important. Sir William Francis Butler put it very well when he said, years and years ago, ``The Nation that will insist on drawing a broad line of demarcation between the fighting man and the thinking man is liable to find its fighting done by fools and its thinking done by cowards.''That is why I believe, Madam Speaker, that Congress should vote to support H.R. 1490 so we may recognize the students of the Joint Advanced Warfighting School with a degree they have properly earned.Madam Speaker, having no further speakers, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:08.526609,2015-03-17 19:09:08.526609,House,AUTHORIZING NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY TO AWARD DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE IN JOINT CAMPAIGN PLANNING AND STRATEGY,2005-06-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-06-07/html/CREC-2005-06-07-pt1-PgH4147-3.htm,74,7,151,H4147-H4148,S000465,mr. skelton
2160,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the achievements of Dr. Wayne Giles, Chancellor Emeritus of the Metropolitan Community Colleges (MCC) in the Greater Kansas City area. Dr. Giles retired as Chancellor on June 30, 2005 after 22 years of distinguished service to MCC and our community. He served as Vice-Chancellor for Educational Services for the first ten years and the past twelve as Chancellor. He has been a tireless advocate for urban education and has implemented programs that have brought national recognition to the Community College system. For this reason and many more, I rise today to honor and celebrate his achievements.Wayne Giles' tenure with the Metropolitan Community Colleges has been fruitful for the bi-state area, the State of Missouri, and our entire Nation. Dr. Giles has overseen the establishment of two new campuses during his tenure, bringing the total to five community colleges in a system that serves approximately 43,000 students each year. The Longview campus was the first community college in the United States to be recognized as a College of the Year by Time Magazine and the Princeton Review. The Business and Technology College is the first community college in the country to earn ISO 9002 certification, which places it within a select group of companies and organizations worldwide that have achieved this quality standard.Dr. Giles has brought many innovative enhancements to MCC, most recently with the development of writing intensive and diversity courses as part of the general education learning requirements. To best serve MCC's increasingly diverse population, he initiated a faculty internship program, which will be featured at this year's American Association of Community Colleges national conference. This program has significantly increased the number of MCC faculty of color in the last two years.Wayne Giles has served on numerous committees, including: Member of the Presidents Advisory Council, NCATC from 2000 to present--a national network of resources that advocates and promotes the use of technology that enhances economic and workforce development programs and services; Member from 1993 to present, and President in 1994 of RC-2000--a national organization of presidents and chancellors of urban community colleges; Member of the Missouri Training and Employment Council from 2001 to present; Member from 2001 to present of the Coordinating Board for Higher Education Resource Group for Postsecondary Technical Education; and as a Member of the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education Advisory Committee from 1990 to present, serving as Chair in 1998.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Wayne Giles, not only for his unwavering effort to educate youth and adults in the Greater Kansas City area, but also for his courage in bringing about diversity in education and providing a vehicle for workforce training to our citizens. I urge my colleagues to please join me, in congratulating Wayne on his retirement as Chancellor of the Metropolitan Community Colleges, and in celebrating his invaluable contributions and sacrifices to provide educational and employment opportunities to constituents of the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri and throughout our region.,2015-03-17 19:09:08.759774,2015-03-17 19:09:08.759774,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF DR.

2161,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise on this rule today to let the American people know of the subterfuge that is going on in these waning days of the Congress.If this rule passes, we will have a bill which amends the budget law to raise the spending limits that now enforce our discretionary budget to reflect the leadership's wanderlust for spending over the past 2 months. This is the day of reckoning for Republicans to wake up and admit the budget resolution they set forth earlier this year was based on a false premise.But in typical fashion, the leadership has decided to determine unilaterally the fiscal priorities of this Congress without a bipartisan agreement on education funding. No money for new teachers, no money for school repairs or expansion, no money for after-school.I ask Members to support the Democratic effort to defeat the previous question so we can appropriately decide the scope of our education investment and then set the new spending levels accordingly.I deeply regret that we have reached this point in the larger budget process. This is no way to run a budget process, a Congress, or a country. This body does not meet. We do not negotiate. We do not discuss. Republican leaders take off 5 days at a time; and as a result, our basic work is undone because we are not here doing our work. The result is one of the biggest budget disasters that anybody can remember.My colleagues on the other side have been so busy throwing money at projects just to get out of town that we have already spent $11.4 billion over the President's request, $11.4 billion over what the President asked for, and they still have not spent a dime to hire a new teacher or build a new school.They have not spent a dime on quality teaching or after-school programs because they have refused to make education the priority of this Congress.We now pass a new CR every day because we are so far into the fiscal year and so far behind in our work. We should be focused on legislation to lift up every public school. This should be the true focus and passion of this Congress.Instead, just yesterday Republican leaders rejected the bipartisan Johnson-Rangel bill supported by 228 Members, Democrats and Republicans, to help districts with school construction, and they came up with their own plan that is a day late and a dollar short. Their plan creates incentives that delay school construction, and half the benefit does not even go to school districts but to bond holders. Private investors. Not children, not principals, not teachers, but bond holders.We are calling on the leadership to pass the bipartisan school construction measure to help modernize our schools. This bill reduces the burden on local taxpayers struggling to finance new construction for their communities. We urge Republican leaders to set aside their opposition and provide enough funding for teachers, emergency school repairs, after-school programs and teacher training, and to put all these measures into the education bill so the President can sign a bill that improves our schools this year.Let us not block progress on education. Let us impose order on this irresponsible budget process. Let us do the work of the American people on education. Stop the delays, stop the foot dragging, stop the electioneering and accomplish something meaningful for our children. We can still salvage something important from this budget process. Let us get it done, and let us get it done this week.,2015-03-17 19:09:08.881859,2015-03-17 19:09:08.881859,House,WAIVING POINTS OF ORDER AGAINST CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4811, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-10-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-25/html/CREC-2000-10-25-pt1-PgH10817-3.htm,135,21,146,H10817-H10841,G000132,mr. gephardt
2162,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the Hope and Opportunity Act of 1997 proposed by President Clinton. The bill creates a Hope scholarship tax credit of up to $1,500 per student for tuition and fees in the student's first year, and another $1,500 in the second year if the student earns at least a B average. The credit will help 4.2 million students next year and will save families $18.6 billion over 5 years. The HOPE scholarship is designed to make the first 2 years of college as universal as a high school degree.The act includes a tax deduction up to $10,000--$5,000 maximum in 1997 and 1998--for tuition and fees paid for undergraduate and graduate education, or job training or retraining. The deduction would be ``above the line'' so it is available even if the taxpayer does not itemize. Some 8 million Americans would benefit from this deduction next year, and it will save families $17.5 billion over 5 years.The act increases the maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000, which would be the largest increase in Pell grants in 20 years. Also, some 218,000 older students would become newly eligible for Pell grants by increasing the Pell grant living allowance.I commend President Clinton for including a Pell grant increase in the bill; however, I think it is critical to demonstrate an even greater commitment to helping low-income families obtain educational opportunities. I propose that Pell grants spending be made mandatory for the next 5 years, with a commitment to restore the maximum Pell grant to its full value by 2002 and will introduce my own bill to do that shortly.The President's bill cuts student fees in half for 4 million low- and middle-income students, saving them $2.6 billion over 5 years. It also reduces the in-school interest rate for 2 million students, saving them an additional $1 billion.The bill extends section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code through December 31, 2000, and reinstates the application of that section to graduate students. The provision, scheduled to expire this year, excludes employer paid educational assistance from an employee's gross income and wages. The bill also creates a tax credit for employer provided educational assistance, and provides income exclusion for student loan forgiveness.The act proposes a number of measures that will level the playing field between the Direct Lending and Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL] programs so they can fairly compete and operate efficiently. It recalls $2.5 billion of Federal moneys currently held in reserve by student loan guaranty agencies by clarifying that the Department of Education is the ultimate insurer of all FFEL guarantees. The bill also standardizes repayment plans for the Department of Education loan programs, and increases the percentage lenders and guaranty agencies must bear for student loan defaults.Unlike proposals made by Republicans who want to give tax breaks to the wealthy, the Hope and Opportunity Act of 1997 gives tax relief to middle-class families struggling to pay for college. It is critical to ensure that middle- and low-income students not face insurmountable barriers to higher education. I believe we should move the President's higher education plan to the top of our legislative agenda.,2015-03-17 19:09:09.138042,2015-03-17 19:09:09.138042,Extensions,THE HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1997,1997-04-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-08/html/CREC-1997-04-08-pt1-PgE599-3.htm,40,0,143,E599-E600,C000488,mr. clay
2163,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,"Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in 
honoring the work of Dr. Doris Jones Wilson, a music legend and icon in 
the St. Louis, MO community. For over 65 years, she has worked as an 
instructor, arranger and performer of music from every genre. Dr. 
Wilson's retirement marks just one more wonderful milestone in a life 
of service. It is my pleasure and privilege to ask the Senate to pause 
for a moment to honor Dr. Wilson today.Dr. Wilson is a beloved member of the St. Louis community. She first 
earned a bachelor of music education degree from Lincoln University in 
Jefferson City, MO. She continued her education at Washington 
University in Saint Louis earning a master of arts in teaching and 
later a doctor of education in music education. Following her studies, 
Dr. Wilson went on to become a professor of music and director of the 
Concert Chorale of Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis. Dr. 
Wilson recently retired from her position as minister of music for the 
West Side Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis.Dr. Wilson has received numerous awards and commendations over the 
course of her career that recognize the exceptional impact her work as 
a musician, teacher and choral director has had on the music community. 
I was so humbled to learn that this previous September, the Kennedy 
Center featured a special performance of one of her most popular 
arrangements, ``Even Me.'' This is only one in a long list of honors.In 2004, Hampton University awarded her the Living Legend Award of 
Ministers and Choir Directors. She received the Missouri Arts Award 
from the Missouri Arts Council in 1998 and the Excellence in Teaching 
Award from Emerson Electric in 1997. In 1994, Dr. Wilson was honored 
with the Stellar Performer Award from the St. Louis American newspaper 
for outstanding leadership in music education. That same year the 
Bahamas Department of Tourism wrote Dr. Wilson a letter of commendation 
for Concert Choral Performance. In 1981, Dr. Wilson was awarded the 
Gold Medal for Concert Choral at the International Music Festival.As a Representative of the great State of Missouri and a resident of 
St. Louis, I am proud and humbled by the life and career of Dr. Wilson. 
I have no doubt that she has touched the lives of many students with 
her wonderful gift and spirit. The education and wisdom that she has 
passed on as a music educator will live on in the work her students do 
and the people they become. I truly believe that the impact her work 
has had on the St. Louis community is immeasurable.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and 
honoring Dr. Doris Jones Wilson on her retirement. ",2015-03-17 19:09:09.382216,2015-03-17 19:09:09.382216,Senate,TRIBUTE TO DR. DORIS JONES WILSON,2011-11-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-11-01/html/CREC-2011-11-01-pt1-PgS7003.htm,165,0,157,S7003,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2164,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Madam President, on Thursday morning, the Senate took cloture votes in relation to motions to proceed to S. 953 and S. 1003, which represent a Democratic and Republican proposal, respectively, to address the interest rate offered on subsidized Federal Stafford loans, a form of Federal student loan available to many who are pursuing a postsecondary education. I was unable to be present for these votes, due to a prescheduled commitment; before the timing of these votes was envisioned, my attendance was confirmed at a women's conference. Because my presence would not have changed the outcome of either vote, I honored my previous commitment. Had I been present I would have voted in support of S. 953 and opposed S. 1003.In my State, over 150,000 students will borrow subsidized Stafford loans next school year. These are need-based loans given to kids who have studied hard and families who have made financial sacrifices and plan to borrow what they need to cover the rising costs of higher education. Rather than reward their efforts, the government plans to add to their burden unless action is taken. On July 1, the interest rate on new subsidized Stafford student loans is scheduled to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent.We are facing a crisis. Already, officials at the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have all warned that student borrowing threatens to dampen consumption, depress the economy, limit credit creation, and pose a threat to our Nation's financial stability. Students and graduates in my State are already heavily in student loan debt. Two out of every three Missouri students will leave college with student loan debt. If we fail to take action, students with subsidized Stafford loans will have to pay over $1,000 more than they would under current interest rates on their loans. At a time when a higher education is vital to expanded opportunity for so many young people and with a 21st century economy that increasingly demands workers with the skills learned as part of a college education, we cannot be making it even more difficult for young people to financially achieve a college education. We need to act.There are several proposals to address this impending crisis. I am a proud cosponsor of two bills that would provide needed relief and give Congress the opportunity to address a long-term solution to exploding student loan debt when it reauthorizes the Higher Education Act.The first, S. 953, the Student Loan Affordability Act, introduced by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, would lock in the current 3.4% rate for subsidized Stafford loans for 2 years while Congress works on a long-term solution to slow the rapid accumulation of student loan debt. This bill would be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes enjoyed by companies that move American jobs offshore, big oil companies, and the wealthiest Americans.I am also a cosponsor of Senator Warren's Bank on Students Loan Fairness Act which would give students the same deal we give to the big banks by allowing those who are eligible for subsidized Stafford loans to borrow at the same rate offered to banks through the Federal Reserve discount window. This is commonsense, and it is fair.Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe the solution to this current uncertainty is even more uncertainty. Their solution, S. 1003, would produce variable, uncapped interest rates that would hit low-income students the hardest.Today's votes leave us in the same situation we were in: we need to act to prevent student loan interest rate increases that would additionally burden our students. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve meaningful legislation that preserves the availability of student loans and the economic opportunities they afford as an option for future generations of Americans. ,2015-03-17 19:09:09.617377,2015-03-17 19:09:09.617377,Senate,VOTE EXPLANATION,2013-06-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-07/html/CREC-2013-06-07-pt1-PgS4019-3.htm,80,0,159,S4019-S4020,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2165,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate will take votes in relation to the Manchin amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1911, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act. I was unable to be present for this vote, due to a pre-scheduled commitment in my home State for which my attendance was confirmed before the timing of these votes was set. Because my presence would not have changed the outcome of either vote, I honored my previous commitment. Had I been present I would have voted in support of Senator Manchin's amendment.We are facing a crisis. On July 1, interest rates on new subsidized Stafford student loans doubled, from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. Already, officials at the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have all warned that student borrowing threatens to dampen consumption, depress the economy, limit credit creation, and pose a threat to our Nation's financial stability. Students and graduates in my State are already heavily in student loan debt. Two out of every three Missouri students will leave college with student loan debt. At a time when a higher education is vital to expanded opportunity for so many young people and with a 21st Century economy that increasingly demands workers with the skills earned as part of a college education, we cannot make it even more difficult for young people to financially achieve a college education. We need to act.While not perfect, the Manchin amendment is the product of bipartisan compromise, forged and supported by Members from both sides of the aisle. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation because it will provide relief to our Nation's students by lowering interest rates for America's student loan borrowers. This relief will not only apply to subsidized Stafford loans; it will apply to loans to undergraduates, graduate students, and the parents of students seeking to pay for their education. Importantly, this legislation also includes interest rate caps; without this feature, I would not have been able to support this bill.I would have also supported the second-degree amendment put forth by Senators Reed and Warren because it is consistent with my commitment to keeping rates low. The Reed-Warren amendment would provide certainty to students and families by ensuring that interest rates will go no higher than they would under the fixed rates in current law without adding to our deficit. I believe this is a responsible measure that deserves bipartisan support.To be clear, addressing the issue of student loan interest rates is only one piece of the puzzle of ensuring that higher education is affordable and attainable to those who seek it. We must also examine the issues of the rising costs of college attendance and the rapid growth of the proprietary college sector, where the share of Federal student aid payments and loan defaults is disproportionately and alarmingly high.I will continue to work with my colleagues on all of these issues. Congress has an important role in helping American students attain the higher education opportunities they seek, to ensure that our Nation remain a global leader in the 21st century economy. ,2015-03-17 19:09:09.949618,2015-03-17 19:09:09.949618,Senate,SMARTER SOLUTIONS FOR STUDENTS ACT,2013-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-07-24/html/CREC-2013-07-24-pt1-PgS5863.htm,107,81,159,S5863-S5894,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2166,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize St. Vincent Catholic High School in Perryville, MO, which was recently named to the list of the best 50 Catholic secondary schools in America. The list is compiled by the Catholic High School Honor Roll, an independent project of the Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Acton Institute, a research and education organization. Around one-half of all U.S. Catholic high schools go through the application process for the Honor Roll list, a group of approximately 1,300 schools. These schools are recognized based on their academic excellence, civic education and Catholic identity. Schools provide extensive data on standardized testing and other academic measures, and administrators answer surveys on academics, Catholic teaching and social studies.St. Vincent High School is a part of the history of Perryville. The parish was first established in the 19th century. The Daughters of Charity began the school in 1907. Over more than a century the school has maintained its commitment to educating their students in a faith based way that helps them spiritually and to prepare for the future. The students, faculty, and families involved in St. Vincent High School provide a wonderful example to schools all across Southeast Missouri and the nation. This recognition encourages their hard work and continued excellence in Catholic education.This is an outstanding achievement in which the St. Vincent High School and all of the surrounding community should take pride. One of the best Catholic schools in the nation is St. Vincent High School. Congratulations again to the St. Vincent High School community. We are all very proud of you!,2015-03-17 19:09:10.093716,2015-03-17 19:09:10.093716,Extensions,HONORING ST.

2167,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Missourians, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mill Creek Elementary School in Columbia, MO.Mill Creek Elementary is celebrating 20 years of dedication to educating its students. When Mill Creek opened in 1989, it served 486 students. Now, the school is home to 90 faculty and staff members and 760 students.Mill Creek Elementary has educated and advanced thousands of students over the years. The faculty and staff have helped students to develop the knowledge and skills that will serve them throughout their lives so they may contribute to their communities one day.At Mill Creek, students pledge to be respectful of themselves and others, responsible for their own learning and behavior, and resourceful problem-solvers. These standards are known as the 3 R's: respect, responsibility, and resourcefulness. Mill Creek hopes to instill these standards within its students so they will use them not just at school but also in their homes and their communities.Public education is strengthened when schools have the support of the local community. KMIZ-17, Rolling Hills Veterinary, Columbia Insurance Group and Boulevard Bank have all stepped forward to be involved at Mill Creek through the Partners in Education program. These businesses provide time and support to students through mentoring, hands-on lessons and even a school weather station.Strong parental involvement also leads to school success. Mill Creek benefits tremendously from the countless PTA and volunteer hours donated by family members and community leaders each year.Mill Creek Elementary has been committed for over 20 years to providing a high quality education to its students and preparing them to be leaders in their community. Parents, students, teachers and staff can all be proud of their accomplishments.Congratulations to the Cougars! ,2015-03-17 19:09:10.249833,2015-03-17 19:09:10.249833,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2009-12-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-12-03/html/CREC-2009-12-03-pt1-PgS12319-2.htm,178,0,155,S12319,B000611,mr. bond

She attended Milliken College and the University of Missouri, Columbia, where she graduated in 1954 with a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Education and where she was a member of the Pi Beta Phi Sorority. She established scholarships at the School of Education in honor of her mother.Marilyn taught second grade at LaDue Elementary School in St. Louis. She was a member of the Grace Bibb Society in support of the MU School of Education and a member of the Friends of the MU Library and MU Kansas City Alumni Club.

2169,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Northwest Missouri State University. Established in the year 1905, Northwest Missouri State University has just marked 100 years of outstanding service in higher education.Beginning as a two-year Normal School for teacher education, Northwest Missouri State University now is a nationally and internationally recognized university offering bachelor and master degree programs. Beginning in 1984, Northwest Missouri State University established a culture of quality and has won the Missouri Quality Award three times.An innovative leader, the first electronic campus at a public university in the United States was founded at Northwest Missouri State University in 1987. Northwest Missouri State University is a national leader in alternative fuels, having put in place a wood pellet system that has produced the University's own heating and cooling for more than 20 years, and providing a significant savings to the University and the State of Missouri.Among public colleges and universities, Northwest Missouri State University maintains one of the highest graduation rates at more than 60 percent. Students at Northwest Missouri State University consistently rank the university at the top of student satisfaction measurements.

2170,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and exceptionally distinguished career in the field of education will soon come to an end. Dr. Bobby Patton will be retiring from his position as President of Central Missouri State University on June 30 after six years of service to the University.Dr. Patton received a BA in Speech, Theatre, and English at Texas Christian University, a Masters in Speech and Drama at the University of Kansas, and a Doctorate in Speech Communication at the University of Kansas.Dr. Patton has had an exceptional career in education for many years. In 1967, Dr. Patton began his educational career at the University of Kansas as the Associate Chair and Acting Chair of the Department of Speech and Drama. In 1972, Dr. Patton continued his career at the University of Kansas as the Chair of the Department of Speech and Drama. In 1980, Dr. Patton was Chair of the Division of Communication and Theatre at the University of Kansas. After his twenty year career with the University of Kansas, Dr. Patton continued his educational career with California State University as the Dean of the School of Arts and Letters. Following his career at California State University, Dr. Patton served as the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Professor of Communication Studies at Wichita State University. In 1999, Dr. Patton continued his educational career as the 13th president of Central Missouri State University.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Patton has served the field of education for over thirty-eight years.

2171,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge Members to vote for the Slaughter-Dicks, amendment which will be offered later today.The arts are an integral part of our Nation's heritage and the arts represent the treasures of our Nation. They help children learn. Through arts education, millions of our children enter a world where they discover music, drama, dance, as well as the visual arts.And the arts are not only important for cultural enrichment in the education of our children. From coast to coast, the arts are economic engines in our Nation's communities. The arts contribute $134 billion a year to our economy, according to a recent study. And in my hometown of St. Louis, the arts contribute almost $500 million to the local economy and are a source of employment for thousands of people.If this amendment passes, funding for the arts and humanities would be increased by just $15 million. That is a modest increase, but the benefits are huge. I think it is time, once and for all, to end the assault on funding the arts that we have seen over the past years.I hope today we can cast a bipartisan decisive vote. I hope we will send a strong signal. I hope we will demonstrate that the Congress is committed to enriching our culture and strengthening our education in our economy.Jack Kennedy said in 1962 that one of the ``fascinating challenges of these days'' is ``to further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all the processes and fulfillment of art.''Vote ``yes'' on this important amendment.

2172,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Northeast Missouri State University in Kirksville, MO, and to inform my colleagues of the university's exciting new name, Truman State University. The university's commitment to excellence has been recognized nationally, and with its mission as Missouri's liberal arts and sciences university, it is only fitting that its name honor the State's most famous native son, Harry S Truman.Like President Truman, the university had humble beginnings when it was founded by Joseph Baldwin in 1867, as Missouri's first Normal School. In 1870, the Normal School graduating class numbered 15 students. In 1996, approximately 1,200 students will graudate from Northeast Missouri State University. Since its founding the university has educated more than 45,000 graduates who can be found in every State and throughout the world pursuing careers in education, sciences, public service, business, law, and the arts.In addition to this explosive growth the university has expanded into new fields of study sicne those first graduates. In recognition of the university's strong emphasis on the liberal arts and sciences, it was designated Missouri's official liberal arts and sciences university by the Missouri State Legislature in 1986. Northeast has also distinguished itself as a leader in student achievement and has been repeatedly recognized as a national leader in excellent, cost-effective, education.On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University will officially become Truman State University. It is with this change in mind that I offer my warmest congratulations on more than a century of outstanding education and the hope that Truman State will enjoy continued success as Missouri's liberal arts and science university.,2015-03-17 19:09:10.973348,2015-03-17 19:09:10.973348,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO NORTHEAST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY,1996-06-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-06-25/html/CREC-1996-06-25-pt1-PgE1159.htm,95,0,142,E1159,V000112,mr. volkmer
2173,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Catholic Schools Week 2010.From January 31 to February 6, 2010, nearly 2.2 million students who attend the nation's 7,248 elementary, middle and secondary Catholic schools will celebrate Catholic Schools Week.More than 48,000 students attend Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of St. Louis, which includes 10 counties and the City of St. Louis. Over 21,000 additional Catholic students are served through 122 parish schools of religion.I applaud the efforts of faculty and parents who provide our nation's children with an excellent education focused on faith and values.The 2010 theme, ``Catholic Schools--Dividends for Life: Faith, Knowledge, Discipline, Morals'' reminds parents of the dividends that a Catholic school education offers. Students are prepared in faith, knowledge, morals and discipline which last a lifetime. There is no better way to invest in a child's future--and the future of our nation.Recently, 10 Catholic schools in my congressional district joined together and raised more than $200,000 for the Key Player Initiative, which provides permanent, supportive housing to the homeless in the St. Louis region. Dan Buck, the head of St. Patrick Center, which provides services for the homeless and indigent in the St. Louis area, said the efforts of these students amazed and humbled him. He went on to say ``We learn to never underestimate the power of children and the support of our community.'' At the same event, George Henry, the superintendent of Catholic education for the Archdiocese of St. Louis said, ``our students put into practice what they are taught about treating others as Jesus would. Through the Key Player Initiative, they learned that the homeless and poor are right here in St. Louis and did their part to make this city a better place for all of us to live.'' This initiative is just one of many examples of the efforts catholic schools in my district have become involved in, and there are similar stories from many other districts throughout the country.Catholic Schools Week is a testament to the outstanding work by the Archdioceses across the country.The Archdiocese of St. Louis has a longstanding tradition of leadership. I thank the Archdiocese for their commitment to enriching the lives of children by providing an education based on family, values, and faith.For that reason, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1008, honoring the contributions of Catholic schools and I am pleased to honor them in their continuing endeavors.Vote ``yes'' on H.

2174,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring the work of Reverend Sam Mann, a leader in the Kansas City community. Reverend Mann's retirement is yet one more wonderful milestone in a life of service.Sam was raised in Eufala, AL, and made Kansas City his home as a young man. Over the years, he has been a tireless civil rights advocate in Kansas City and the Nation. He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and participated in numerous activities to raise awareness of race and justice issues.Since 1971, Sam has been the pastor of St. Mark's United Methodist Church in downtown Kansas City. He has been the executive director of United Inner City Services, a multiservice community-based agency, since 1967.I have always known Reverend Mann as ``rubber band.'' This derives from the time I was walking with him through a roomful of young children who were attending a program he had designed that predated his establishment of the St. Mark center. From the beginning, Sam was always looking out for children. As we were walking through the room, the children were pulling on his coattail saying, ``Reverend Mann, Reverend Mann'' but it sounded like ``rubber band, rubber band.'' From that day forward, he has always been ``rubber band'' to me.Sam believes in the importance of education and has been a strong advocate for early childhood education. Under his leadership, St. Mark Child and Family Development Center was established. This center started in a church basement and now is located in a beautiful state-of-the-art facility. In addition, the center serves as a neighborhood anchor, providing a safe, warm and attractive site for a variety of community services. St. Mark annually serves approximately 225 very low and low-income families through its early childhood education program, before- and after-school program and summer camp. These children and their families have been forever impacted by Sam's work and dedication.Sam was the founder of the Presbyterian Urban Ministers Network, was a cosponsor of Kansas City's Urban Peace & Justice Summit, and served on the Board of the Black Archives of Mid-America. For 25 years, he has served as chair of Kansas City's local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.While we hope that retirement affords Sam some much deserved relaxation and time on the golf course, we also look forward to his continued involvement in education projects and social justice issues important to the lives of Kansas Citians.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Reverend Sam Mann on his retirement. ,2015-03-17 19:09:11.293568,2015-03-17 19:09:11.293568,Senate,TRIBUTE TO REVEREND SAM MANN,2010-09-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-20/html/CREC-2010-09-20-pt1-PgS7203-2.htm,126,0,156,S7203,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

2177,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Margaret Williams, The Missouri Teacher of the Year 2008-2009 Recipient. The Missouri Teacher of the Year is a prestigious honors program that focuses public attention on excellence in teaching. Williams, a 37 year educator has earned the respect and admiration of students, parents, and colleagues alike. She inspires students of all backgrounds and abilities to learn. For the aforementioned reasons, I enthusiastically honor Mrs. Williams today before Congress.Louis, Missouri. She was inspired by her psychology teacher Mr. Brown to pursue a career in education. Mrs. Williams went on to graduate from the University of Missouri--St. Louis.Mrs. Williams is the social studies department chair for University City High School in University City, Missouri where she has been teaching for the last 18 years. Williams who also teaches history, government, and an African-American experience course was one of six finalists to compete in this year's competition.The Missouri Teacher of the Year program is conducted annually by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, in conjunction with the National Teacher of the Year program. Major funding for Missouri's program is provided by The Boeing Company, St. Louis, Missouri.Before joining University City, Williams began her illustrious career in education as principal and administrator from 1986 to 1990 at West Side Christian Academy in St. Louis. After which she taught at the Visual and Performing Arts High School and Beaumont from 1971 to 1986.Williams is the first in the University City School District to be named Missouri Teacher of the year and was honored with a special drum line presentation, and video made by the district as part of her nomination package.Madam Speaker, Mrs. Williams has my absolute highest recommendation to be honored today.

2179,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I think that the whole energy issue is quite convoluted because we are never able to address the issues that we want the American public to benefit from because there are always little tricks.For example, LIHEAP was placed in the energy bill last year, which is money for low-income individuals to get assistance in their heating costs, and so that is placed in there. So that, if you vote against it, it means that you are against poor people, and of course I voted against it because at some point I came to the conclusion that I had to be faithful to who I am. I am not voting for any of those things anymore, where they do what we call the ``got you'' legislation, and I am not voting for that anymore because the American public ends up suffering every time we do that.But the question that I think is going to be raised here is will Congress make the decision to allow legislation to surface that would require that they give up gas guzzlers when they use government money to do the lease. Now, this is not private vehicles, but what the public may not know is many Members of Congress legitimately will lease automobiles. They can only lease them for 2 years because we are only here for 2 years, and then we must go up for reelection. So we are saying that when the lease expires, if you really believe in energy efficiency, then let us make sure that the public can see us as ones who are embracing what we are preaching. It is a horrible, horrible thing to advocate in a commercial that people should drink Coca-Cola and then people visit your home and you have Pepsi.So I think one of the things Congress must do, it is a moral thing I believe to stand up and say we are going to drive energy efficient cars. It gives us the right then to begin to talk to the public about some legitimate sacrifices that all of us are going to have to make.Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about energy supplies and the cost of a tank of gas and how difficult it has been for Americans to deal with those increases, and another equally important issue is how people are going to continue to be able to educate their children from their youngest age all the way through higher education.One of the things I think it is important for us to highlight tonight is the devastating budget cuts that this Republican budget puts forward in terms of the public education needs that we have.Literally, the Republican House budget resolution would make the biggest cut, and I think I am right, correct me if I am wrong, the biggest cuts to the Department of Education in 23 years. I guess the only thing that would be worse would be when they proposed to completely eliminate the Department of Education, but they are not doing that. They simply have the biggest cut in 23 years.The budget resolution cuts next year's Department of Education budget by $2.2 billion, with a B, below this year's funding level. It matches the President's budget cuts in his budget proposal dollar for dollar. Rather than increase education funding, both of the budgets, the Republican leadership's budget and the President's, grossly underfund education, social services and training programs. They cut those programs $4.6 billion below the amount needed to maintain current services. They eliminate completely 42 different education programs, not ones that people would think are not necessary anymore, but things like vocational education, safe and drug free school State grants, a college readiness program for low income students and both parts of the Federal Perkins loan program. It is just really unbelievable. You talked about priorities. This is where the Republicans priorities are compared to where we are as Democrats.,2015-03-17 19:09:12.094145,2015-03-17 19:09:12.094145,House,THE CONTINUED MISDIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY,2006-05-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-05-10/html/CREC-2006-05-10-pt1-PgH2488-2.htm,56,22,152,H2488-H2495,C001061,mr. cleaver

He attended Central Missouri State University and graduated from Lincoln University in 1956, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Secondary School Education. He earned his masters in Secondary School Administration from the University of Missouri-Columbia. He was united in marriage to Nancy Brettschneider on November 24, 1955. They were blessed with four wonderful children, three sons and one daughter.Mr. Rackers began his career teaching at Helias High School in the fall of 1956. He was the head basketball and track coach and assistant football coach. He was the Athletic Director from 1966 until 1967, when he became Assistant Principal. In 1971 Jim became the first lay principal at a Catholic secondary school in Missouri. Jim was principal until 1992, when he became Helias' first Chief Administrator. In 1997 he became the first Director of Development for Helias High School and Executive Director of the Helias Foundations. On May 1, 1998, the newly constructed Field House was named the James L. Rackers Field House in honor of his years of dedication and loyalty to Helias High School.Along with his successful career, Mr. Rackers was an active member of St. Peter Catholic Church and was also a member of numerous professional and community organizations. Mr. Rackers was a member in the National Association of Secondary School Principals, Missouri Association of Secondary School Principals, North Central Association, National Catholic Education Association, Committee on Accredited Schools Non-Public, and the Missouri Council for American Private Education. He received numerous awards; including the 1991 Communicator of the Year Award from the Public Relations Society of America, 1997 Immaculate Conception Outstanding Alumni Award, 1997 Certificate of Appreciation for outstanding services to students in Support of Vocational Education at Nichols Career Center, and 25 year Silver Service Award of the Missouri Association of Secondary School Principals.Mr. Speaker, James Lee Rackers was a valuable leader in all aspects of his life.

Commencement is a joyous time filled with celebrations and happiness, but also sadness and trepidation as students begin their adult lives and careers in new cities, often leaving friends behind.East Central College's upcoming graduation will be no different. There will, however, be one major difference from previous graduations--it will mark the last time that Dr. Karen Herzog presides over her students in her official capacity as the college's President.As such, I rise today to honor Dr. Karen Herzog for her distinguished academic career and commitment to higher education. Dr. Herzog grew up in Carthage, Missouri and studied at Ozark Christian College in nearby Joplin where she earned a B.A. in literature. She subsequently earned a master's degree in American literature from Kansas State University and later a Ph.D. in higher education policy from the University of Kansas.Dr. Herzog started her academic career at the Metropolitan Community College District system located in the greater Kansas City area where she taught English. After fifteen years, Dr. Herzog moved into an administrative role at the college. She rose through the ranks and eventually assumed the position of Associate Vice Chancellor of Education. In 1999, East Central College offered Dr. Herzog the Presidency, which she accepted.For the past six years, Dr. Herzog has made an indelible mark on the students of East Central College and residents of Franklin County. She has chaired the Franklin County Economic Development Council and been a member of the Franklin County Family and Children Mental Health Board, the Washington 353 Redevelopment Corporation and the Union Rotary Club. While at East Central, Dr. Herzog established a centralized Learning Center for students, earned full ten-year accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and attained record enrollment levels. Dr. Herzog has clearly had a positive impact on the community, on East Central College, and most importantly, on the students that have received a quality education as a result of her efforts.It has been a pleasure working with Dr. Herzog and I wish her continued success in her future endeavors.

2184,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise against the Republican budget because it cuts women's education acts and programs.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Democratic budget substitute and in opposition to the Republican plan which fails to address the needs and fiscal challenges America faces today. Instead of creating jobs, it creates record deficits. It shortchanges education, healthcare, veterans and does little to aid the sagging economy. Further, it makes drastic cuts to programs that provide educational and business opportunities to women across the country.This budget eliminates Women's Educational Equity Act Programs, which fund activities promoting educational equity for girls and women. Over 10 percent of young women drop out of high school, yet the President's budget eliminates funding for dropout prevention programs. As a former teacher, I understand the importance of education in providing young men and women with the background they need to lead successful lives. This budget cuts many vital programs such as Head Start and Even Start and freezes funding for Pell Grants.More than 3.8 million women are looking for work, yet the Administration cuts $79 million in funding for the Small Business Administration, which helps women and minority owned small businesses grow. There are more than 7 million small businesses owned by women. The need for SBA assistance continues to be vital to my community.This budget freezes funding for The Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which provides child care assistance for low income families and early education services to disadvantaged children and is essential to working women nationwide.Further, violence against women prevention programs and SBA Women's Business Centers are underfunded, and no increase is requested by the Administration for the National Women's Business Council, which conducts invaluable research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations.Mr. Chairman, this budget fails to meet the fiscal challenges America faces today and slashes programs that are the lifeline to working families, especially women heads of households. I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic substitute as a much more realistic budgetary solution that restores funding to vital programs and achieves balance in the budget and assistance to those who seek the American dream.,2015-03-17 19:09:12.871697,2015-03-17 19:09:12.871697,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005,2004-03-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-24/html/CREC-2004-03-24-pt1-PgH1443-3.htm,38,15,150,H1443-H1451,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

2187,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, it is back-to-school time. Indeed, as I look at the clock above the Speaker's chair, in about 2 hours when we call for votes, this Chamber will fill with our colleagues; and there will be some of the same giddiness as kids going back to school. And the inevitable question we ask one another is what did you do on your summer break?Certainly I think as we prepare for some very solemn events later this week as well as next week and certainly recognizing the impact of a year ago, I think a lot of attention has caused us to really forget some of the important education initiatives that have passed and become law. Specifically, this Congress began last year with a renewed commitment to education. ``Leave no child behind'' has become a familiar mantra. In fact that landmark legislation of leaving no child behind is now the law of the land and really starts with the mindset that a child, any child, can learn.As President Bush stated, indeed as Governor of the State of Texas, ``The Federal Government must be humble enough to stay out of the day-to-day operation of local schools, wise enough to give State and local school districts more authority and freedom, and strong enough to require results. We must make our schools worthy of all of our children. Whatever their background, their cause is our cause. It must not be lost.''Thereupon we came together in a very bipartisan way and passed that landmark legislation. But Congress did not stop there. Last summer in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, there were some significant tax incentives to improve the affordability of education, not just higher education but kindergarten through elementary school, through secondary, essentially schoolchildren of all ages that would be able to take advantage of through their parents or other mentors or family members, opportunities of savings vehicles and incentives through the Tax Code.Yet, Mr. Speaker, as you know and as this body knows, a year ago when we enacted the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, because of some very technical, arcane procedural rules in the other body, there was a sunset provision placed upon those tax incentives relating to education. What this bill today, H.R. 5203, attempts to do is to make permanent those positive savings vehicles, those tax incentives that would help all parents across the country really focus on their children's education.Certainly, as we debated this a year ago, the idea is a simple one. No child should be discriminated against because of the choice of where he or she goes to school. Public schools, private schools, religious schools, home schools, any child should have the advantage of these tax incentives through parents or other mentors as far as educational expenses.We cannot in Congress, of course, set tuition rates. We cannot set student fees. In my hometown of Columbia, Missouri, as college students are coming back, they are lamenting the fact that they are facing an 8 percent tuition hike this year. There is nothing that not only this legislative body but other State legislatures can do as far as the rising cost of tuition. However, we have acted as far as making college education and other educational expenses more affordable, education more accessible. It is time to make those provisions in the Tax Code permanent, those tax relief measures. This body has acted making the entire Economic Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001 permanent. We have also acted as a body to make those pension opportunities permanent, the marriage penalty repeal permanent as well as the death tax repeal. We believe it is time for Congress to make a renewed commitment to make permanent the education tax incentives. Accordingly, I ask that H.R. 5203 be adopted.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:13.271975,2015-03-17 19:09:13.271975,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE PERMANENCE ACT OF 2002,2002-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-04/html/CREC-2002-09-04-pt1-PgH6022.htm,110,3,148,H6022-H6028,H000948,mr. hulshof
2188,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise briefly to welcome and congratulate my colleague, Senator Carnahan, the newly elected Senator from Missouri, on her first remarks on the floor. I apologize for not being able to be here when she made the comments. I was in a Health Committee meeting asking questions about Missouri education programs of the Secretary of Education.I understand Senator Carnahan was talking about education on the floor, and I know education and children's issues are going to be areas where we will work together. Yesterday, Senator Carnahan joined as a cosponsor on a couple measures that are very important, ensuring 100-percent deductibility on health insurance for the self-employed, which is very important to farmers and small business people in my State, and also providing relief from the draconian cuts enforced by HCFA on home health care agencies, which cost us half the home health care agencies in Missouri.We have many areas in which we are looking forward to working together. I tell my colleagues that Senator Carnahan has been a long-time friend. She and her family were close associates in Jefferson City. Senator Carnahan was best known in Missouri as a very strong helpmate of our late Governor, treasurer, and servant, Mel Carnahan. I got to know her very well when they shared the same public housing in which we had lived, the Governor's mansion in Missouri. She was a very strong champion of the preservation of that mansion and a most gracious hostess for all the people of Missouri who came there.After the terrible tragedy which befell her family in our State last year, she was strong and gracious and was widely respected and admired by all Missourians. I know colleagues on this side of the aisle who have not had an opportunity to get to know her and work with her will look forward to doing so. I congratulate her and wish her well after making her first speech on the Senate floor. I know there will be many other issues which affect our mutual constituents on which we will be working together.I thank the Chair and my colleagues for indulging me as I extend a very warm welcome to Senator Carnahan.,2015-03-17 19:09:13.408078,2015-03-17 19:09:13.408078,Senate,SENATOR CARNAHAN'S MAIDEN SPEECH,2001-02-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-02-15/html/CREC-2001-02-15-pt1-PgS1442.htm,22,0,147,S1442,B000611,mr. bond
2189,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Continuing Resolution, the fourth resolution in as many weeks to keep the government open. I call on Republicans to stop the delays, stop the obfuscation, and keep Congress in session so we can finish our work. We must do the people's agenda, and we must do it now.We are now three weeks beyond the start of the fiscal year, and the light at the end of the tunnel is still not shining brightly. We do not meet. We take off days at a time. We spend our time on the floor naming courthouses, voting on suspension bills.And the American people are not seeing any results.Education is America's number one priority. But this Congress has failed to meet the challenge. Republicans have refused to dedicate funding to reduce class size and for school construction. They are unwilling to fund critical priorities so communities can hire more teachers, improve teacher quality, and provide more after-school programs. Instead, they support block grants with no accountability that a single teacher will be hired or a single classroom fixed. They also let the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expire for the first time in 35 years because of their extremism.The time has come to stop the delays, stop the foot-dragging, and act on the education priorities of the American people. We should not neglect the people's agenda for personal politics. This Congress should stay in session and finish our spending work. We should take a first step to make every public school a great public school.Democrats want funding dedicated to emergency school repairs; the bipartisan Johnson-Rangel tax credit to help schools districts on school construction bonds; funding to hire 100,000 highly-qualified teachers to reduce class size, and for teacher training and recruitment and after-school programs that are an essential part of any school reform.We are in an Information Age. Every child needs to know how to read and write. Parents are working more and they are commuting more, and they have less time for children. And our public schools are not equipped to fill the breach. What we are asking for is a sensible, first step toward filling the holes in our education system. And I believe there is still time to work together, in a bipartisan way, to meet this challenge.Let's stop neglecting our work, stop passing these stopgap measures, and do what any sensible legislative body would do: finish our spending bills, fund the priorities of our people, and get away from the special interests.,2015-03-17 19:09:13.640266,2015-03-17 19:09:13.640266,House,FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgH10402-3.htm,132,37,146,H10402-H10411,G000132,mr. gephardt
2190,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed that we find ourselves debating this bill today. With all the problems facing our schools, overcrowded classrooms, crumbling buildings, teacher shortages, it boggles the mind to see that the first bill passed out of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities this year is one as petty as this one.It is designed as a political ploy to embarrass Secretary of Education Riley and President Clinton. There is no reason to act on this bill today. The fiscal year 1998 Labor HHS Education Appropriations bill is very clear. It prohibits the use of 1998 fiscal year funds to field test, administer, distribute or implement any national test. The appropriations bill also requires three separate studies by the National Academy of Sciences, which are due later this year.This proposal fails to address a number of issues of critical concern to parents, students, teachers and schools. And I ask some questions, some very basic questions that this Congress ought to be asking, that our Chairman referred to in his opening remark:Will a national test accommodate students who have limited English proficiency or disabilities? Could the test be used for high stakes purposes such as tracking, funding reductions, grade retention and graduation thresholds? How will civil rights protections be ensured in the development, use, and administration of the test? How do we weed out bias and discrimination in the content of a national test? And most importantly, will those students who fail the test be provided significant new resources to ensure that they will have real educational opportunities?These are legitimate concerns and legitimate questions that this Congress ought to answer. But if this bill passes, the sponsor of this bill will preclude the Congress from ever acting in these areas.Mr. Chairman, we should act to resolve these and other serious questions about national testing in a measured, deliberate way during this year's reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress, and the National Assessment of Governing Boards.Mr. Chairman, with so few days in this legislative session, it is critical that the House act wisely and constructively on urgent education priorities. We should be passing legislation to repair our Nation's crumbling schools and overcrowded schools. We should be initiating legislation calling for reduced class sizes and stronger after-school programs. This bill does nothing to address these critical needs. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat.,2015-03-17 19:09:13.782368,2015-03-17 19:09:13.782368,House,PROHIBITION ON FEDERALLY SPONSORED NATIONAL TESTING,1998-02-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-05/html/CREC-1998-02-05-pt1-PgH339-2.htm,7,42,144,H339-H355,C000488,mr. clay

In fact, when you walk into the school, the doormat there says ``Don't do drugs.''This constant educational process that helps young people realize that with every choice there comes a responsibility, it sounds like this is also working in your home district.,2015-03-17 19:09:13.905431,2015-03-17 19:09:13.905431,House,OUR RIGHT TO SAFETY AND FREEDOM FROM FEAR,1997-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-23/html/CREC-1997-04-23-pt1-PgH1781.htm,49,5,143,H1781-H1786,H000948,mr. hulshof

But in the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Millender-McDonald], we have gained a colleague who has already used her talents as a State lawmaker to become a national leader.A former school teacher, Ms. Millender-McDonald has been an innovator on education policy, pushing for creative reforms in California's inner-city schools, such as better English instruction, tougher standards and model school-to-work programs. That may be why she was appointed to the National Commission on Teaching in America's Future and the Education Committee of the States, where she serves as a powerful voice for California.She has also worked to start workshops all across the country to encourage broad education reform.But education is just one of the issues on which she has made her mark. From her seat in one of California's most diverse assembly districts, she fought for transportation improvements that are creating hundreds of new jobs, for child care, for grandparents raising their grandchildren, for the growth of high-tech business in California, for basic rights for the homeless, and for reform of California's workmen's compensation laws.When she became chair of California assembly's insurance committee, she was the first woman and the first minority to do so.When she became chair of the revenue and taxation committee, she was also the first woman to do that. She has blazed a trail of innovation and accomplishment on every issue that she has faced.My colleagues, not only have we gained a tireless and effective new champion for the 37th District of California, a woman with almost unlimited interests and abilities, we have also gained a sage and experienced legislator, and in keeping with her first career I believe she can teach us a great deal.Join me now, my colleagues, in welcoming our newest colleague, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Millender-McDonald].,2015-03-17 19:09:14.038519,2015-03-17 19:09:14.038519,House,A WELCOME TO THE HONORABLE JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE,1996-04-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-16/html/CREC-1996-04-16-pt1-PgH3394-4.htm,48,2,142,H3394-H3395,G000132,mr. gephardt

2194,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, with some reluctance, I rise to oppose the D.C. appropriations bill and to urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit that will prevent the use of Federal funds for private school vouchers.Here we are again, on the floor of the House debating an appropriations bill that should have been passed 4 months ago. But the Republican majority continues to mismanage the people's business, seeking to bootstrap their radical ideas to regular spending bills. And this D.C. appropriations bill is the latest egregious example of their scheme of legislative blackmail.I commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Mr. Gunderson, for his good faith attempt to help the District of Columbia improve its public schools. The citizens of this city and their elected officials have embraced many of his ideas. But, they have categorically rejected the idea that public dollars should be siphoned off to finance private school education. And, yet this conference report ignores the expressed will of D.C. citizens because radical elements in the Republican Party insist that its their way or the highway. Those same elements have made clear their intent to destroy public education, and they are wiling to trample on the democratic rights of over one-half million U.S. citizens in order to gain a foothold in their war against public education. While this Capitol Building is the seat of national Government, it is not the ``big house'' and the District of Columbia is not Jerry Falwell's plantation.Isn't it ironic that the very people who complain about Federal intrusion into the affairs of local school districts, and other aspects of modern life for that matter, are fighting to impose a federally funded, federally mandated private school voucher plan on the District of Columbia? Rest assured, if they try to force that idea on my constituents they will be in for the fight of their political lives.Mr. Speaker, by substantial margins the American people rate improvement of public education as their No. 1 priority. I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to highjack Federal tax dollars that instead should address that priority.,2015-03-17 19:09:14.293701,2015-03-17 19:09:14.293701,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2546, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996,1996-01-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-01-31/html/CREC-1996-01-31-pt1-PgH1064.htm,13,99,142,H1064-H1077,C000488,mr. clay
2195,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.Mr. Chairman, this bill authorizes States to arbitrarily and capriciously waive provisions of important Federal education programs under the guise of granting flexibility to local school systems. I support flexibility in the administration of Federal education programs, but only if it is coupled with strong accountability provisions and preserves the emphasis on serving the poorest children.This bill fails on both accounts. First, it provides no accountability for ensuring reliable reporting and increased student achievement. Second, it allows States to significantly diminish the mission of Title I, which is to serve the poorest schools and the poorest children before the more advantaged.Mr. Chairman, it is legislative folly to let States waive elementary and secondary programs before beginning authorizing and drafting the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.There is no urgency for this bill. Current law authorizes and Secretary Riley has waived hundreds of Federal education laws to grant flexibility to States and school districts. The Secretary testified that he believes this measure should be considered with the overall ESEA authorization, and the GAO reported that there is insufficient information to assess the Ed-Flex pilot that allowed waivers in 12 States.Mr. Chairman, data from the National Assessment of Education Progress showed that 9-year-olds in the poorest schools improved their reading scores by 8 points, or almost one grade level between 1992 and 1998. It also pointed out that 10 out of 13 urban districts showed dramatic increases in math and reading for elementary students in the highest poverty schools. These results are directly attributable to Title I assistance. Measurable success in these areas should serve to broaden our commitment to increasing investment in public schools, to continue our targeting to the poorest children, and to insist on greater accountability for results.Presently, the Title I statute allows schools with at least 50 percent of their children from low-income families to operate a schoolwide program. These programs allow schools with high concentrations of poverty to combine Federal funding to reach certain funding goals. This provision has been a vital reform in Title I schools because it allows schools to coordinate efforts among Federal programs targeted at the most needy children. That will not happen without such authority.Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) will offer an amendment to prohibit schools with less than 35 percent poverty from operating a schoolwide program. The Republican majority and Democrats who support this bill claim that H.R. 800 will not reduce funding for poor children. However, an initial report from the Department of Education found that waivers reduced funds for poor children by 18 percent in 1995 to 1996. And if this trend is extended nationwide, it would have a devastating effect on most disadvantaged schoolchildren.The Republican majority claims that this legislation provides the proper balance between accountability and flexibility. I disagree. The accountability provisions in this legislation must be strengthened if the majority's claim is to be more than political rhetoric.Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) will offer an amendment to improve the accountability provisions in this legislation. The amendment would require States to have their content and performance standards and aligned assessments required under the Title I statute in place. In addition, this amendment would reinforce the sound education principle that assessment should measure change in student performance from year-to-year and separate out data based on categories of at-risk children.Lastly, Mr. Chairman, the amendment would require States to hold LEAs accountable for educational objectives and goals as required by the act and to close the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their peers.Mr. Chairman, this bill will provide most States with new, sweeping authority to waive Federal law. Given that the Federal Government will invest an additional $50 billion in education funding over the next several years, these accountability provisions are more than appropriate. They are compulsory.I believe that H.R. 800 in its present form lacks sufficient accountability and targeting and will jeopardize the long-standing mission of Title I to assist in the education of our disadvantaged children. While the majority has sought to capitalize on the simplicity of the call for more flexibility, we do not believe that should be at the expense of educating needy children.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:14.415788,2015-03-17 19:09:14.415788,House,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-10/html/CREC-1999-03-10-pt1-PgH1089-2.htm,38,3,145,H1089-H1115,C000488,mr. clay

2197,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Congressman, I really respect you for that vote because what I think a lot of people listening this evening might not understand is Congressman Hoekstra took the very first House bill of a Republican administration, it was their pet bill, and you had the guts to stand up, as a Republican, to the Republican administration, and say, no, because I believe education is a local control kind of issue.Now I have to relay an amusing story because I voted ``no'' on it too, and some staffer made a mistake and invited me to the bill signing ceremony. So I actually sat in the bill signing ceremony for No Child Left Behind after having voted ``no'' the same way you did.And I think that is precisely what the public wants. They want to take this place apart. Education can be done fine at a State level, and in my opinion, as a former State representative, I would say it ought to be done at the local level. But certainly we don't need a bunch of Washington bureaucrats telling us how to educate our kids.

2201,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, today I am introducing the Deposit Restricted Qualified Tuition Programs Act of 2009. My bill establishes an avenue for those wanting to save for the college education of a child, grandchild or other related individual, to do so in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured deposit. At the present time, savers can only access the 529 college savings program through a securities based plan and my bill would not change this avenue.However, following the recent crash of the stock market, many savers saw their accounts drop in value by fifty percent or more and as such are reluctant to place any more monies in a securities based plan. Furthermore, many small savers can find investing in securities based products both complex and intimidating. A FDIC insured deposit option would provide guaranteed principal return and a guaranteed return on the deposit, all from a commercial bank that the saver likely has a relationship with. This proposed legislation will help families across the United States save in a safe, sound and simple manner for their children and grandchildren's college education.Again Madam Speaker, this bill does not make any changes to the current 529 college savings program nor the current delivery system of the program through a securities based plan. It simply adds another 529 college savings program delivery option through an FDIC insured deposit.,2015-03-17 19:09:15.385478,2015-03-17 19:09:15.385478,Extensions,DEPOSIT RESTRICTED QUALIFIED TUITION PROGRAMS ACT OF 2009,2009-09-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-17/html/CREC-2009-09-17-pt1-PgE2305-3.htm,132,0,155,E2305,C001061,mr. cleaver
2202,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I appreciate the gentleman from Utah getting perhaps philosophically to the heart of this debate. Really, the question is are we going to go down the path. And if you take a look, there was a nation that we knew very well back just a few years ago, and the nation had this basic operating philosophy: the government will provide you with an education. The government will provide you with a job. The government will provide you with a house. The government will provide you with health care. And we see our own country. And that nation was called the Soviet Union which is now in the dust bin of history.Now we see our Nation providing housing, providing food, providing education, and now we are talking about health care. Now, this is a little different speed, though, because before when someone was hungry, the proposal was give them a food stamp, which I am not sure was very efficient, but it wasn't to federalize every grocery store and every farm in America.This proposal that we are talking about is different. This is saying that we are going to step right in and the government is going to take over one-fifth of the U.S. economy, and that is a pretty tall step to take.,2015-03-17 19:09:15.538592,2015-03-17 19:09:15.538592,House,HEALTH CARE,2009-09-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-16/html/CREC-2009-09-16-pt1-PgH9638-16.htm,131,59,155,H9638-H9646,A000358,mr. akin
2203,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, when people get into the details of health care, I think they sometimes miss seeing the very big picture.

It also means an end to the costly war in Iraq, and the repeal of President Bush's irresponsible tax breaks for those who don't need or want them.

Mr. Warren had a blacksmith shop which served as an informal gathering place for the local farmers. Mr. Warren's shop was named the county seat of the newly created County of Johnson. The township was named Warren's Burg, in honor of the blacksmith.Warrensburg citizens have many reasons to be proud of their city. One of these reasons is the city's excellent school system. With an enrollment of 3,200 students, the district is accredited with Distinction in Performance by the Missouri State Board of Education. Also, the city is home to Central Missouri State University, which has provided fine post secondary education for more than 130 years.Warrensburg also is home to many prominent businesses and organizations.

These endowment programs are vital to supporting the creation, preservation and presentation of the arts and humanities in America. In my district, NEA and NEH grants have brought partnership projects such as the Coterie Theater and the Friends of Alvin Ailey's AileyCamp that help provide collaborative artist and youth activities which have enriched the local economy and educational experiences of our children.Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. Test results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores than other students.There is no jurisdiction for funding for the NEA at a level that is 30 percent below the 1994 level. Adopting the amendment before us would increase funding by $10 million for the NEA and $3.5 million for the NEH. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which would keep up with inflation.

2211,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Chamber about the critical need to attract qualified teachers to the education profession.Over the next decade, a large percentage of teachers will retire, depriving our schools and our children of the knowledge and leadership gained through years of experience. This problem affects both urban and rural schools, but especially high-needs schools with large numbers of children below the poverty level.Teachers are saddled with the responsibility of educating our children in their classroom studies, teaching morals and values, and making them productive members of society. Our teachers are instrumental in influencing our children's development, and yet there is little acknowledgment or reward for this responsibility they carry.As the husband of a kindergarten teacher and the father of three, I understand that a teacher who remains in the classroom and has a passion for teaching is a great benefit to our children. We need to find ways to attract young professionals to teaching careers by offering incentives to keep them in the teaching profession and develop them into talented educators. H.R. 438 encourages those going into the teaching profession to stay in a career they are passionate about while affording them the financial ability to do so.Teachers are the foundation of our children's education and development, and, therefore, it is necessary to invest in the well-being of their careers. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 438.,2015-03-17 19:09:17.449951,2015-03-17 19:09:17.449951,House,TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ACT OF 2003,2003-07-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-07-09/html/CREC-2003-07-09-pt1-PgH6383-4.htm,100,29,149,H6383-H6393,G000546,mr. graves
2212,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today in support of House Resolution 335, honoring the commitment of our Nation's Catholic Schools to excellence. Catholic schools continue to enrich the lives of our children by providing excellent education as well as spiritual enrichment.The numbers speak for themselves. Catholic schools boast a 95 percent graduation rate, with 83 percent of students continuing on to higher education. But the Catholic school experience fosters more than just scholastic excellence. Catholic schools provide spiritual guidance to students, instilling in them fundamental values that are crucial to the overall development of these students. Catholic schoolchildren gain an appreciation of the importance of family values, community service, and faith in their lives. This, in turn, shapes Catholic school students into leaders of tomorrow.I am proud of the Catholic schools in my district that continue to establish such high standards--Saint John LaLande in Blue Springs, Bishop Hogan Memorial in Chillicothe, Saint Andrew the Apostle in Gladstone, Saint Patrick and Saint Therese in Kansas City; Saint James in Liberty, Saint Gregory Barbarigo in Maryville, Saint Charles Borromeo in Oakview, Bishop LeBlond High School, Co-Cathedral, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Saint Francis Xavier, Saint James and Saint Patrick in Saint Joseph.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the contributions of our Catholic schools and look forward to their continued achievement.,2015-03-17 19:09:17.697148,2015-03-17 19:09:17.697148,Extensions,HONORING CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2002-02-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-02-04/html/CREC-2002-02-04-pt1-PgE63.htm,6,0,148,E63,G000546,mr. graves
2213,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention that a few weeks from now will be National Association of Insurance Women week.Professional insurance women constitute over 50 percent of those employed in our Nation's insurance industry. For that reason, the National Association of Insurance Women and its 400 local affiliates are dedicated to the development of leaders for the insurance industry.NAIW and its affiliates promote personal and professional development through education, networking and leadership opportunities to all women in the insurance business. Both national and local organizations continually strive to raise the standards of ethics, consumer education and customer service throughout the insurance industry.NAIW local affiliates are engaged in charitable causes to strengthen and enhance hundreds of communities throughout the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Professional insurance women have earned recognition for their many accomplishments in the economically vital insurance industry.It is important that we celebrate and honor the women who are performing such important and diverse roles throughout the risk and insurance industry. ,2015-03-17 19:09:17.916276,2015-03-17 19:09:17.916276,Senate,NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE WOMEN WEEK,2001-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-03/html/CREC-2001-05-03-pt1-PgS4241-4.htm,59,0,147,S4241,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2214,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to vote and speak against this conference report and ask Members on both sides of the aisles to do the same thing. This is not a good budget for America.We did not get to vote the other night because we did not have two pages, but now that we have seen all of the pages, the problem was not the lack of the right pages. The problem with this budget is that it does not have the right numbers. It does not fulfill the priorities of the American people. It is a budget that is deficient in terms of fiscal responsibility and in terms of the right priorities that I think people have.In many ways, this budget is a definition of what we want the country to be in the next 10 years. So it is a momentous decision that we are making.I believe this is a day that we give up on fiscal responsibility. I thoroughly believe that if this budget is followed, that in the days ahead we will return to deficits.First of all, there is no cushion. The cushion that looks like is here is not here, and when the tax cuts go up, as they inevitably will, when other tax cuts that are not contemplated in this budget are actually passed, the deficits will start. We will invade Social Security and Medicare, which we said we did not want to do.We have had innumerable votes here on lockboxes, but I predict that if this budget is passed we will be into Social Security and Medicare.This is the day that we return to high deficits and high interest rates. Why in the world would we want to do that? For 20 years in this country all we ever talked about was deficits and what deficits meant to our ability to fund anything that people wanted to fund; what it did to high interest rates; what it did to high inflation. Now, with this budget, I believe we are back into deficits and back into invading Social Security and Medicare.This is the day that we give huge tax cuts to the wealthiest special interests in the country, and we cannot seem to figure out how to get a decent tax cut to the middle-income Americans who really need it. Again, half of the tax cuts contemplated here go to the top wage earners in our country, and there is not enough for the hardworking families that really need tax relief.This is a budget that turns its back on education. This is probably the most remarkable trade-off in this budget. The President sent a budget that asked for $21 billion over 10 years above inflation for education programs. The budget that the Democrats here on the House had asked for was $150 billion over 10 years above inflation for education. In the Senate, in a bipartisan way, they added $300 billion above inflation for education, for after-school and pre-school; give us more teachers, repair the school buildings, all the things that Americans are asking for across the country to improve public education. Yet, this budget takes out every cent of the increases that the President asked for or we asked for or the Senate asked for. We are at a flatline budget for education if this budget is voted for.How in the world do we explain to anyone what we have done on education? We are right back to where we started, after a long trip of public relations saying to people we want to help education, and now we are not doing that.Then I think if this budget is passed, there will not be a Medicare prescription drug program. In fact, I do not think there will be a prescription drug program of any reasonable kind that will affect the people in this country. When I go home now on weekends, people come up to me and say, ``Hey, where is the prescription drug program?'' Everybody had ads in the campaign, Republicans and Democrats alike. We all said we wanted a prescription drug program. I defy anyone to find that program in this budget.Why do I say that? I say that because I think the budget tries to get to $300 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug program. The problem with that is it spends the Medicare surplus. It is really taking the money out of the Medicare surplus to give it to prescription drugs. I do not think we are going to do that. I do not think we are going to have a prescription drug program if this budget is our budget.I did not even get to low-income energy assistance, COPS on the beat, conservation and renewable programs for energy. If one goes out in America today, all anybody can talk about is $3 gasoline and not having enough electricity. If one goes out on the West Coast, they are having brownouts and blackouts.People are focused on energy and there is nothing in this budget to deal with the energy issue, which is on the lips of every American today. Let me sum up by saying just one thing. This budget is a farce and it is a fraud. At the end, America deserves better than that. We can do better than that. I would pray we could send this budget back to the committee. Let us have a real bipartisan process where ideas from both sides are incorporated into a final product. Let us give America a budget that is worthy of this great country.,2015-03-17 19:09:18.149449,2015-03-17 19:09:18.149449,House,ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE,2001-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-09/html/CREC-2001-05-09-pt1-PgH2031.htm,63,44,147,H2031-H2049,G000132,mr. gephardt
2215,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, it is with much pride that I rise today to congratulate one of Missouri's educators. With emphasis placed on the need to reform our public schools and ensure that our children receive quality instruction, it pleases me to know that Graden Elementary School is on the right path. I ask that you join me in congratulating Principal Michael J. Otto, recently named a recipient of the 2001 National Distinguished Principals award.The U.S. Department of Education, along with the National Association of Elementary School Principals, began this program in 1984 to honor those principals that exemplify the vital leadership necessary to guide our school communities. Education Secretary Paige commented that, ``Principals today--more than ever before--are critical leaders in the effort to improve America's public schools. I applaud these outstanding principals for their dedication, achievements, tirelessness, and leadership. I look forward io working with principals across the nation . . . to improve the performance of all students so that no child is left behind.'' I could not agree more with Secretary Paige's comments. I find it admirable that the recipients were nominated by their peers, further demonstrating the effects of their commitment to educational excellence.I am honored to represent a man who has given so much of himself to provide our schoolchildren not only with excellent instruction, but also inspiration. Again, I congratulate Principal Michael J. Otto and commend him for his diligent work on behalf of our schoolchildren.,2015-03-17 19:09:18.407632,2015-03-17 19:09:18.407632,Extensions,CONGRATULATING PRINCIPAL MICHAEL J.

2216,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Safe and Successful Schools Act of 2000. It will help modernize our public schools by providing grants and loans for up to 8,300 renovation projects in high-need school districts. It will continue the highly successful class size reduction program by helping communities hire an additional 20,000 highly qualified teachers. It will boost investments in quality after-school and summer school programs advocated by the President. It will help us close the digital divide that currently leaves too many poor children and their teachers behind. It will bolster safe and drug free school programs, and strengthen programs to reduce hate crimes by children.ESEA is our nation's flagship education partnership with local communities. It provides vital assistance to the most vulnerable, educationally challenged children in America. Until this Congress, the ESEA had enjoyed a rich and enduring history of bipartisanship.Unfortunately, Senate and House Republicans have been highly partisan and divisive. At the beginning of the ESEA process, we urged Republicans to work in a bipartisan way. Instead, they proceeded in a highly partisan manner and created havoc throughout the reauthorization process. In the House, they carved up the ESEA into seven disjointed pieces--hoping to bolster their devastating public image and terrible performance on education.Today, the ESEA process is in shambles. Straight A's, the Republican education block grant bill, has a veto threat pending and has no chance of becoming law. Their Teacher Empowerment bill has a veto threat pending because of its gratuitous attack and block granting of the Clinton Class Size Reduction Act. Conservative Republican Members are blocking floor action on two other ESEA bills, Even Start and Impact Aid. And the one major bipartisan bill, H.R. 2, has been sharply and publicly attacked by reactionary Republican Members of the Education and Workforce Committee.Republicans repeatedly refused to work with Democrats to craft the pending ESEA bill, H.R. 4141, and voted in mass to defeat 52 of 54 amendments offered by Democratic Members. The bill passed out of committee is a legislative disaster. Every major education group opposes the bill. The President will probably veto it.Because the Republicans have decided to play politics with America's school children, they have placed in jeopardy passage of this comprehensive Federal aid program to education. If the Republicans leave town this year without enacting the ESEA, it would be the first time that the program has permanently lapsed in its 35-year history.I urge the Republican leadership to stop playing politics with our nation's school children, and pass ESEA legislation that can bring urgent relief and assistance to our public schools this year. Helping Communities Repair and Modernize Unsafe SchoolhousesCommunities across the country are struggling to address critical needs to build new schools and renovate existing one. One-third of all public schools--about 25,000 schools-- need extensive repair or replacement. A recent survey documented over $250 billion dollars of unmet school modernization funding need. The Safe and Successful Schools Act of 2000 authorizes $1.3 billion annually to help communities make emergency school renovations such as repairing roofs, fixing dangerous electrical wiring and plumbing, bringing schools into compliance with fire safety codes, undertaking asbestos removal or abatement, and removing lead-based paint. The Act will support up to 8,300 renovation projects in high-poverty, high-need school districts that have little or no capacity to fund urgent repairs over the next five years.Expanding Access to Education Technology/Closing the Digital DivideTechnology in the schools can substantially improve student learning, classroom management, the professional development of teachers, and assessment of student progress. Most importantly, strong school technology programs report significant impact on gains in student achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics. Technology has its greatest impact with low-income and rural students as well as with expanding opportunities for girls. Unfortunately, the ``digital divide'' still separates the technology haves and the technology have-nots--leaving our most disadvantaged children without vital knowledge and tools to compete with their more advantaged peers. The Safe and Successful Schools Act of 2000 increases the Federal commitment to technology and closing the digital divide. The Act provides $500 million for the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund program, to help the most disadvantaged school districts to provide educators with sustained, high quality training to integrate technology in their classrooms and provide students with the latest access to advantaged technology resources. The Act creates a $50 million Go Girls program to help encourage the ongoing interest in girls in science, mathematics and technology, and prepare girls to pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees and careers in science, mathematics, or technology. The bill will provide new support for restructuring teacher education programs so that new teachers are proficient in the use of educational technologies and can integrate technology throughout their instructional practices. Lastly, it also creates new initiatives to develop and expand cutting edge technologies to improve teaching and learning, and to establish community technology centers in the neediest communities.,2015-03-17 19:09:18.637794,2015-03-17 19:09:18.637794,Extensions,THE SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS ACT OF 2000,2000-05-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-02/html/CREC-2000-05-02-pt1-PgE613.htm,52,0,146,E613-E614,C000488,mr. clay

I think it is a shame that in his last year here in Congress we could not have made it easier for him, but I think he has worked real hard to fund important programs to improve the education, health, and well-being of all Americans.I commend him very much for the hard work that he has done to double NIH over the 5 years, increase funding for graduate medical education for children's hospitals, and in strengthening our Nation's community health centers.From one who represents a very poor area, a very rural area, the fact that he has been able to increase our community health centers by $81.3 million is a huge boost to those people who are underserved in my area, who do not have access to affordable health care, and every dollar that we spend on community health centers will help the insured have much more health care than they presently have.I also want to just mention quickly the $200 million increase for impact aid funding. These help reimburse our localities for revenues lost. I can tell the Members, with so much public land in my district, this is going to be a very big boost.I would ask my colleagues to support this bill.,2015-03-17 19:09:18.896974,2015-03-17 19:09:18.896974,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-06-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-08/html/CREC-2000-06-08-pt1-PgH4055-2.htm,70,36,146,H4055-H4077,E000172,mrs. emerson

One amendment calls for a $5 billion investment to help local communities repair crumbling and overcrowded schools. The other would provide critical assistance to communities that are committed to locally driven public school renewal. Unfortunately, the majority of the Committee on Rules blocked consideration of these education measures by refusing to waive points of order against the amendments.To me it is incomprehensible that we continue to ignore the needs of millions of schoolchildren desperately in need of our help. It is also incomprehensible to me that with all of the problems that we are facing and our school systems are facing that this silly piece of legislation would be the first one to come out of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities in this session of Congress. It has nothing to do, it has no relevancy whatsoever with resolving or addressing the problems that our children are facing in the school system, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we may address the Nation's real educational priorities.,2015-03-17 19:09:19.131147,2015-03-17 19:09:19.131147,House,PROHIBITION ON FEDERALLY SPONSORED NATIONAL TESTING,1998-02-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-05/html/CREC-1998-02-05-pt1-PgH339-2.htm,7,8,144,H339-H355,C000488,mr. clay

2220,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the conference report, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the Rangel motion to recommit. I believe with all my heart that this issue, education and child rearing, is the most important issue that faces us as a people. We have never needed more in our history to have well-educated, mentally capable young people.In my home State of Missouri, the only issue that really dominated the State legislature was how we could go from 30,000 to 60,000 prison cells over the next 5 years, a symbol of failure of our child rearing and our education system in this country.I am tough on law and order and so are my constituents. But I say to my constituents, you cannot afford what we are doing. We cannot afford to hold a million and a half people in prison, to carry them, to keep them because they are unsafe to have in our society. We also know that if we raise children correctly, they will not get into trouble. They will not be dysfunctional citizens. But we also know our society has changed dramatically. People are not at home to raise children as they once were. That is a fact of life. We are not going to change that. And so we have to put the investment into education so that children are raised correctly.What this bill misses entirely is that there is a whole revolution going on out in public schools to fix the schools to meet the need. In my district, I have a school in the inner city that is getting great results. The kids get great grades. I went there and I asked them how they are doing it. They said, we have parents as first teachers in the public school to teach parents how to be better parents and how to raise children. They have preschool in the public school. They have after-school in the public school, so children are engaged even at age zero, age 6 months, age 1 year, age 3 years in constructive, professionally run activities so they can be productive citizens when they come out of the education process.Does this bill support that effort that is going on in Shepherd School in my district? I daresay not. What this bill offers is $7 a year to the families that are sending those kids to Shepherd School. No, what Shepherd School needs is not this bill. This is a silly bill. It is a frivolous bill. It is not serious about public education. Seven dollars a year to families in my district fighting to get their kids a good education is frivolous.The Rangel substitute would offer real help to the people at Shepherd School. What do they need? They need bigger classrooms. They need a competent building. They need computers in the classrooms. They need help, real help. Listen to Paul Vallas, CEO of the Chicago Public Schools. This is somebody that is on the line every day. Mayor Daley in Chicago said, ``Give me the schools, give me the responsibility, and we will fix them,'' and he is fixing them. He put his best person on this job. Here is what Paul Vallas says. He says this bill, the Coverdell bill, is really designed to give more affluent people compensation for decisions they already made to go private. That is all it is. This does not help public education. It does not help the people that are out there in the crucible of the fight to fix public education. It helps just a few people who have already chosen to send their kids to private schools. What a shame this is. What a missed opportunity this is.I urge Members to vote for the Rangel substitute, which gives real, tangible help to the real revolution that is going on out there in the real world to fix the public schools so all of our kids are productive citizens, and vote against a frivolous, unserious, ridiculous piece of legislation that does nothing but help the privileged few.,2015-03-17 19:09:19.594476,2015-03-17 19:09:19.594476,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2646, EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1998,1998-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-18/html/CREC-1998-06-18-pt1-PgH4727-5.htm,80,45,144,H4727-H4739,G000132,mr. gephardt

2224,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.Madam Speaker, I am supporting the bill before us today because, on balance, it provides some students an additional option to consolidate their loans. While this serious problem with loan consolidation cannot be minimized, I am pleased to hear that the Department of Education is making good progress in eliminating the backlog of loan consolidation applications. I believe Secretary Riley has a strong commitment to eliminate this backlog and to prevent future problems.Madam Speaker, I remain confident about the quality of service direct lending provides in originating student loans, and there continues to be substantial support in the use of direct lending in the education community. It is indisputable that by providing competition, direct lending has brought great improvement to the whole student loan program.Finally, Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this bill includes an amendment I offered, along with the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], that will ensure that students who receive HOPE scholarship credits will not have their Pell grants or other student aid reduced. Without this amendment, some 69,000 students would lose an estimated $125 million annually.Madam Speaker, I recommend that the Members of this House support this bill.,2015-03-17 19:09:20.589183,2015-03-17 19:09:20.589183,House,EMERGENCY STUDENT LOAN CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 1997,1997-10-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-10-21/html/CREC-1997-10-21-pt1-PgH8845-3.htm,142,97,143,H8845-H8850,C000488,mr. clay

I am proud to note that this bill was favorably reported by the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities with unanimous, bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, this bill corrects a problem with respect to section 326 of title III of the Higher Education Act. That section was added to the act in 1986 as a way to provide support for historically black graduate and professional institutions of higher education which perform vitally important services for our Nation.As Mr. Norwood stated, the five schools initially included in section 326 educate more than half of all black doctors, dentists, and pharmacists, as well as 75 percent of all black veterinarians each year. That is a major return on the small investment provided by the Federal Government.H.R. 3055 allows those five institutions to continue to do what they do so well. It will allow them to remain eligible to receive section 326 support at no additional cost to the Federal Government.I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.

2227,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you, Mr. President.As I mentioned earlier, education is the key to breaking the intergenerational cycle of welfare dependency. This amendment would allow States to require that parents on welfare be responsible for ensuring that their minor children are in school.It would be this simple. If you are on welfare, your children should be in school. If we care about breaking the vicious intergenerational cycle of welfare we should care about making sure that individuals who are on welfare accept the responsibility of sending their children to school. We must look to the long-term in reforming welfare. We must look at what we can do to save the future of our children. Every child in America can attend school. Every child can earn a high school diploma. It costs nothing but commitment. Too often education is ignored and trashed because it is devalued by our welfare culture. Teen dropout rates soar. They skip classes. We should not pay parents to encourage lifestyles of dependency on and off welfare and in and out of minimum-wage jobs. States should be able to give children on welfare a fighting chance.Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:09:21.327701,2015-03-17 19:09:21.327701,Senate,RECESS,1996-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-23/html/CREC-1996-07-23-pt1-PgS8501.htm,109,63,142,S8501-S8532,A000356,mr. ashcroft

2229,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of International Women's Day. For more than 100 years, this important day has recognized the critical roles and contributions women play worldwide. International Women's Day reminds us of how far we've come and of how far we still need to go in order to achieve gender equality worldwide.Women continue to face serious challenges across our globe, particularly with access to health care, education, and economic opportunity. Women also are overwhelmingly the targets of human trafficking and gender-based violence. Today, women and girls are disproportionately burdened by extreme poverty, making up 70% of the world's one billion people who live off less than $1 per day.Here at home, we celebrate March as Women's History Month. The focus this year is ``Women's Education--Women's Empowerment'' which clearly reflects the goals of furthering gender equality worldwide. And it is no coincidence that one leads to the other. When women and girls have access to educational opportunities, their subsequent empowerment allows families and entire communities to flourish. And evidence shows that when these untapped agents of change are empowered to engage in the political process, governments are more effective and responsive to the needs of their people.For real progress in women's rights, we must take a comprehensive approach to combat all barriers to women's equality--physical, psychological, educational, economic, and cultural. Let's use this International Women's Day as an opportunity to reignite our commitment to gender equality here at home and around the globe.,2015-03-17 19:09:21.905117,2015-03-17 19:09:21.905117,Extensions,MARKING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY,2012-03-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-03-09/html/CREC-2012-03-09-pt1-PgE359-3.htm,39,0,158,E359,C001060,mr. carnahan

Senator Earl Blackwell of Hillsboro sponsored Senate Bill Number Seven, which made possible the formation and financing of public junior colleges in Missouri. Jefferson became the second junior college district in Missouri to be approved.Seventeen months later the first courses are offered at Hillsboro High School with 14 faculty members and 303 students. Jefferson College moved into its first permanent building on the Hillsboro campus in September of 1965, and held its first commencement in June of 1966, where 31 graduates received associate degrees.In 1967, Jefferson College became the first community college in Missouri to be designated as an area vocational school. Today, in addition to the Hillsboro campus, the college has expanded to sites in Arnold, Cedar Hill and Imperial, which offers programs in Certified Nurse Assistant, EMT-Paramedic and a Law Enforcement Academy, as well as a fifth campus which offers online instruction.As a testament to their vision to make higher education more accessible to their community, Jefferson College has successfully now grown to over 5,500 full and part-time college credit students and 4,300 plus students in continuing education classes.In closing, I ask all my colleagues to join me in wishing the community of Jefferson College congratulations on their fiftieth anniversary.,2015-03-17 19:09:22.709683,2015-03-17 19:09:22.709683,Extensions,RECOGNIZING JEFFERSON COLLEGE AS IT CELEBRATES ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY,2013-04-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-04-09/html/CREC-2013-04-09-pt1-PgE399.htm,46,0,159,E399,L000569,mr. luetkemeyer

2235,MO,Blaine,Luetkemeyer,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Allan W. Purdy, the founding president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA). On October 13, 2010, this strong advocate for higher education passed away at 96. He dedicated his life to removing financial barriers to education and helping students access awards, scholarships, and financial aid.Purdy's life experiences strongly influenced his passion for financial aid and serving students. He graduated from high school in the middle of the Great Depression and worked his way through college with the help of the National Youth Administration, a newly created national work program for students. He earned a mere $15 a month, which paid for his graduate degree from the College of Agriculture at the University of Missouri.After graduation, Purdy served his country in the U.S. Navy as a PT boat captain during World War II. After the war, he returned to the University of Missouri to work as an extension horticulturist. In this position, he toured the state helping farmers resolve problems with their crops. Here, he saw firsthand the number of qualified students who lacked the financial resources to attend college and vowed to advocate on their behalf for more grants and work aid. The University of Missouri's president promoted him to assistant to the dean of the College of Agriculture, which led to his role in creating a department in the president's office to coordinate scholarships, jobs, and loans for all the students on campus.Under the direction of the University of Missouri's president, Purdy began meeting with other aid administrators in the Midwest and helped form the Midwest Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators in 1962. During this time, Congress was working on student aid issues and looked to the six regional, financial associations for suggestions. In hope of creating a more unified voice, Purdy strongly advocated for a national structure. In 1966, the regional representatives created the National Student Financial Aid Council, and Allan Purdy served as its chair for three years. It became NASFAA in 1969 and has always stressed the importance and needs of students.A large part of the organization's success is attributed to Purdy's tireless efforts and ability to build strong relationships with key policymakers and higher education advocates. He developed a reputation for being an excellent witness at congressional hearings and established NASFAA as a trusted resource for financial aid information.In 1975, Purdy received the first Lifetime Membership Award, the highest award that NASFAA can bestow. He retired in 1979 and was appointed to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority's (MOHELA's) Board of Directors in 1981.We have lost an irreplaceable advocate for college access and success. I believe educating our youth is one of the most important aspects in equipping our children with the necessary tools to succeed.

2236,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to recognize the outstanding service and leadership of Dr. Tom Cummings on the occasion of his retirement after 24 years of service to the North Kansas City School District, including 14 years as the superintendent.Dr. Cummings has dedicated the majority of his life to assisting and educating children. After receiving his undergraduate degree from Franklin College in Indiana and his Master of Science and Doctor of Education degrees from Indiana University, Dr. Cummings has committed almost half a century to education. From coaching basketball to becoming the district superintendent in 1995, Dr. Cummings has continually worked to improve the lives of his students. During his 49 years as an educator, Dr. Cummings also always strived to serve his community. He was president of the Greater Kansas City School Administrators Association, served on the board of the directors for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and served on the Education Commissioner's Advisory Committee.During his time as superintendent of the North Kansas City School District, Dr. Cummings changed the way the school district approached both education and the surrounding community. Dr. Cummings built a core foundation of transparency, community partnerships, technology, and impressive physical facilities. Due to these efforts, the school district began to receive money again from the community to pay for bonds. This was revolutionary for the school district, as every single request for school bonds in the 17 years prior to Dr. Cummings was turned down. Dr. Cummings commissioned a panel of community, government and business leaders that shaped the district's new mission--to provide an elite educational experience that produced enlightened citizens adaptable to change and involved in their communities.Dr. Cummings will leave many legacies at North Kansas City Schools. He created a professional and leadership development program, new career and technical education options for students, organizational efficiency, an award-winning money management team, standardized curriculum and differentiated instruction.Dr. Cummings has also been awarded numerous times throughout his tenure as superintendent. He was honored by YouthFriends as their first recipient of the School-Based Mentoring Achievement and Advancement Award. In 2005, Dr. Cummings was named the Missouri Superintendent of the Year. The following year, he received the Look North award for being an Outstanding Northland Leader by the Clay County Economic Development Council. In 2008, he was recognized as an Outstanding Missourian by the Missouri House of Representatives, and most recently, the school district's administration building was renamed the Thomas P. Cummings Administrative Center.Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Tom Cummings for his many years of dedicated service to the North Kansas City School District. His commitment to the students, the school and our community provide a strong example of the kind of leader we should all strive to be.

2237,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Sumner High School, the first school west of the Mississippi river to offer secondary education to African Americans. This year marks the 130th anniversary of the school's founding as ``The High School for Colored Children.'' Originally housed in the former Washington School at 11th and Spruce streets in downtown St. Louis, the school was renamed on October 12, 1875, in honor of Charles Sumner, a Massachusetts Senator who was an ardent supporter of African-American rights. In 1861 Senator Sumner was the first U.S. Senator to call for full emancipation. The decision to name the school in his honor reflected the school's role as a preeminent institution for African Americans. Dropping ``colored school'' in favor of Sumner High occurred fifteen years before local African-American leaders succeeded in persuading the St. Louis Board of Schools to designate names for all segregated schools.In the aftermath of the Civil War, Missouri passed a new state constitution requiring all school boards to support education for African Americans. However, the Board of Education for Colored Schools occupied only rented space and its schools moved often. Sumner was no exception. In 1895 it was relocated to 15th and Walnut streets, near the saloons and pool halls of downtown St. Louis. Concerned citizens petitioned school officials to move the school again and in 1910 Sumner was relocated to The Ville neighborhood, where it occupied a new structure at 4248 Cottage Avenue. The new Sumner High strengthened the neighborhood's status as a center for middle-class African-American life in St. Louis.Another historical landmark tied to Sumner High School involved the hiring of African-American teachers. Initially, Sumner had an all white faculty, but the parents requested that a special effort be made to recruit African-American teachers. Two years later, in 1877, the school's first African-American principal took charge.Sumner High School further enhanced educational opportunities for African Americans in Missouri when, in 1890, it established an extension called the Sumner Normal School to train elementary school teachers. In 1925 the Sumner Normal School became a college; it was known as the Sumner Teachers College until 1930 when it was renamed Harriet Beecher Stowe Teachers College. In 1940 the Teachers College moved to new facility on Pendleton Street where it remained until 1954 when, in one of St. Louis' first efforts to desegregate its public schools, the St. Louis Board of Education merged Stowe College with the all-white Harris Teachers College.Sumner graduated its first class in 1885 and over the years its alumni list boasts a number of accomplished African Americans, including the opera singer Grace Bumbry, activist Dick Gregory, musician Tina Turner, tennis great Arthur Ashe, Liberian Ambassador Lester Walton, educator Julia Davis, rock history legend Chuck Berry, performer Robert McFerrin, actor Robert Guillaume, Yankee catcher-outfielder (and the American League's first black Most Valuable Player) Elston Howard and local newscaster Julius Hunter, to name just a few.Mr. Speaker, it is with deep pride that I recognize Sumner High School, a symbol of progress in African American history for its distinguished record of achievement in public education. As a community leader and elected official, I am proud to salute Sumner and all Sumner students and alumni on this very special anniversary. Sumner High School is a source of pride for St. Louisans and a model for public schools across the nation.,2015-03-17 19:09:24.596030,2015-03-17 19:09:24.596030,Extensions,HONORING THE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF SUMNER HIGH SCHOOL,2005-05-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-05-26/html/CREC-2005-05-26-pt1-PgE1116-4.htm,72,0,151,E1116-E1117,C001049,mr. clay

Public education, transportation, veterans benefits, environmental protection and small business programs would all be drastically cut in order to increase defense spending and maintain tax breaks for a select wealthy few.Unbelievably, this bill would gut the Social Security surplus in order to ensure that tax cuts for the wealthy are not jeopardized. Social Security is one of the most successful social programs any nation has ever established. It has provided a real and valuable safety net to millions of seniors and yet this budget would diminish it in order to advance a narrow agenda, an agenda that excludes our Nation's seniors, excludes our Nation's children, excludes our Nation's veterans, and offers very little to any citizen who is not part of a small powerful elite.The House Budget Committee bill offers little for education over the next 5 years, providing $9.4 billion less than is authorized by No Child Left Behind, it also freezes funding for Pell grants, cuts funding for Perkins loans, and cuts vocational education by 25 percent.And this budget guts $358 million for health programs in 2005, which is even less than the President requested. And given what we know about the true cost of last year's Medicare Prescription Drug sham bill, it is hard to believe that this budget proposal offers nothing to help seniors with their prescription drug costs while providing $46 billion in special payments to HMOs.Mr. Chairman, under the former administration the budget was balanced for the first time in a generation. Now the current administration has squandered that legacy, our $5.6 trillion surplus is gone and now this budget bill will help achieve a $3 trillion deficit.Mr. Chairman, I support the Congressional Black Caucus Alternative Budget. This legislative proposal would invest in America's future without undermining fiscal stability. This budget plan will improve domestic programs that serve American families; it will increase funding for homeland security, environmental protection, rail transportation, health care and health research. It will also increase funding for veterans benefits and for educational programs including Head Start, No Child Left Behind, Safe and Drug Free schools, Perkins loans, Pell grants and job training, vocational education and adult education.The Congressional Black Caucus raises revenues by rescinding tax cuts for those earning over $200,000 in gross income, it also plugs tax loopholes and eliminates tax avoidance schemes that feed the coffers of the rich and prevent us from paying down the Federal deficit.Mr. Chairman, I support the CBC alternative budget as it is a fiscally sound budget that makes a real investment in our Nation's future.,2015-03-17 19:09:24.816186,2015-03-17 19:09:24.816186,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005,2004-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-25/html/CREC-2004-03-25-pt1-PgH1495-2.htm,39,238,150,H1495-H1565,C001049,mr. clay
2239,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our ``Homegrown Hero,'' Robert J. Mann. As the founder and executive director of Bridging the Gap Inc., Bob is being honored by the organization on October 15, 2004, for his leadership and vision which transformed greater Kansas City into a collaborative and interconnected community of environmental awareness, advocacy and reformation.Thirteen years ago, Bob created Bridging the Gap, an environmental movement of volunteers who created and maintain our first 15 local community recycling centers. It has since grown into a regional, multifaceted environmental movement involving businesses, governments, schools and thousands of volunteers. Under Bob's leadership all segments of the greater Kansas City community have become interconnected and established partnerships working together to make a difference and improve Kansas City's quality of life, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. During a decade of creating change for a healthier community, Bridging the Gap succeeded in educating the public through environmental publications and speakers bureaus, hosting special green events for environmental awareness and advocacy, and ballot initiatives that brought curbside recycling to Kansas City.I have been an ardent supporter of Earth Day since the first one in 1970, when I showed my support by bicycling to my job as a schoolteacher and discussing with my students the responsibility each individual has to our global environment. Since 1997 my Earth Day celebration has come to include Bridging the Gap's Earth Day Walk, an eagerly anticipated annual celebration and fundraiser for more than 1,000 Kansas Citians. More than 5,000 area residents attend the Party for the Planet at the Kansas City Zoo, another Earth Day event sponsored by Bridging the Gap.Bridging the Gap Inc. has grown dynamically and now includes: RecycleFirst, Kansas City's curbside recycling education program; Keep Kansas City beautiful, a beautification project involving more than 7,700 volunteers for 165 metro wide cleanups; Kansas City Wildlands, a natural and wild places restoration and conservation project; Environmental Excellence Business Network, an education and mentoring program for businesses; Waste Reduction and Recycling Consultation, an advisory, assessment and action program for governments, businesses, educational and cultural institutions; Regional By-Product Synergy Initiative, a project to help business and government reduce waste and increase productivity; Shadowcliff Retreat Center, environmental education and retreat center in Grand Lake, Colorado; and Environmental Excellence Awards, an annual event to honor individuals, businesses and schools.Bob's efforts have been recognized locally and nationally for Building the Gap's leadership. Awards include: National Recycling Coalition's Award for Environmental and Community Leadership, Kansas City Consensus Achiever Award, Missouri Governor Carnahan's Pollution Prevention Award, EPA Pollution Prevention Award, American Forest &amp; Paper Association's Best Paper Recycling Award, Mid-America Regional Council Regional Leadership Award, Waste Reduction and Recycling Award for non-profits, Missouri Environmental Education Association Environmental Education Service Award, and Keep America Beautiful First Place National Litter Prevention Award.Bob's leadership and vision of collaboration, his perseverance in environmental problem solving, and his service and commitment to a healthy earth have inspired thousands of individuals to make a difference. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Robert J. Mann, a bridge builder who has indeed made our community, our region and our planet a better place through his tireless efforts to honor our Earth and all who share its wonders.,2015-03-17 19:09:24.950276,2015-03-17 19:09:24.950276,Extensions,HONORING ROBERT J.

2240,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I believe the rule to H.R. 2210 will dismantle Head Start which, in these desperate economic times, should be strengthened, not weakened.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule on the School Readiness Act, which would seriously jeopardize the Head Start early education program.For decades, Head Start has been a successful program dedicated to helping disadvantaged children receive the preparation they need to succeed in school and to lead better lives. This bill would leave our neediest children behind by shortchanging the Head Start program and putting its federal funding at risk in States that are mired in their own budget woes.In my district of Kansas City, MO, over 3,800 children are enrolled in Head Start programs and they depend on help from the Federal Government. Head Start is one of the oldest and most thoroughly studied early education programs in America. Studies find that children involved in Head Start programs are less likely to repeat a grade and to require special education services than disadvantaged children who are not lucky enough to experience Head Start. Furthermore, Head Start students are more likely to graduate high school and to attend college.This past Fall a young mother named Michelle enrolled her son, August, in a Head Start program in Kansas City. Her two older daughters had already successfully completed the program, but Michelle worried that her son's speech and physical disabilities would put him far behind his classmates when he started kindergarten. The Head Start Mental Health and Disability Consultant coordinated his efforts with the County Health Department and the North Kansas City School District to insure that Michelle's fears would not become a reality. An Individualized Education plan was put into place and August was enrolled in speech therapy classes. Today, all of Michelle's children are doing well academically and socially, and she stays involved in Head Start as a volunteer so that she can give back to the program that meant so much to her and her children.The measure before us (H.R. 2210) authorizes barely enough funds to even cover the cost of inflation, let alone expand Head Start programs. It will actually reduce the number of children in the program. It provides no resources for teacher training and will allow discrimination in hiring practices. But the part of this legislation that concerns me the most is that it puts Head Start money into the hands of States that will be able to use these block grant funds to defray their own deficits rather than expanding the program to reach students.Governor Holden of Missouri shares my concern that resources usually suffer when a federal program becomes a block grant. It is his fear, and mine, that federal mandates will be shifted to deficit wracked states such as mine, forcing them to do more with less money.Head Start works in Missouri, and it works all over the country. Let's put federal dollars into education programs such as Head Start that have been proven to make students ready for a successful school experience and a productive life. It's the best investment we can make for our Nation's future.Thank you, Mr. Speaker.,2015-03-17 19:09:25.205463,2015-03-17 19:09:25.205463,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2210, SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2003,2003-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-07-24/html/CREC-2003-07-24-pt2-PgH7518-3.htm,111,70,149,H7518-H7531,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2241,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, the House is meeting today--69 days after the beginning of the fiscal year--to debate H.R. 2673, a colossal $328 billion spending bill that includes 7 of the 13 annual appropriations measures for fiscal year 2004.The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Young, and the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Obey, have worked diligently this year to pass the annual spending bills one-by-one. However, as it became apparent that the Congress could not approve these measures individually, congressional leaders began working to fit them together into one catch-all bill, like the pieces of a $328 billion puzzle. Unfortunately, the pieces of this puzzle are not fitting together in a way that benefits the American people.I will oppose H.R. 2673 because it breaks promises Congress made regarding education, it cuts necessary Federal funds for State and local law enforcement, and fails to extend unemployment benefits for thousands of Missouri workers who are currently out of work this holiday season.Education remains a top priority of the people of Missouri. When I am back home, I frequently visit schools to meet with students and teachers. At nearly every location, teachers and administrators inform me of the difficulties they have when it comes to unfunded Federal mandates burdening their districts. School districts throughout the Show-Me State and the Nation are experiencing tough times as the poor economic conditions and the fiscal choices made by this Congress are leading to decreased revenue for schools. The professionals who teach our children and grandchildren deserve to have the resources they need to get the job done. When the Congress approves legislation authorizing specific legislative initiatives, we ought to fully fund them.H.R. 2673 provides $7.8 billion less than Congress promised in the No Child Left Behind Act and falls 45 percent short in special education funding promised under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reauthorization bill that passed earlier this year. It also freezes Pell Grant awards at a time when State universities are drastically increasing tuition costs and underfunds by 18 percent the funds necessary for Impact Aid. H.R. 2673 also establishes a private school voucher program for students who live in the District of Columbia, moving Congress a step closer to abandoning our historical commitment to public schools and establishing the first Federal subsidies for getting a private school education.As a former prosecuting attorney and juvenile officer, I have worked closely with law enforcement officials. Law enforcement personnel play a critical role in protecting Missouri communities from the scourge of methamphetamine abuse and other crimes and from the threats posed by terrorism. Congress has a duty to provide adequate funding for those who protect us in our hometowns. Under H.R. 2673, State and local law enforcement is funded at $500 million below last year's levels.As the holidays approach, millions of Americans are still facing unemployment. While economic news has indicated that the numbers of jobless Americans decreasing, Congress must work to extend unemployment benefits to those who are not so fortunate. Time and again, we have worked in a bipartisan manner to assist unemployed Americans. I am disappointed that the House leadership has failed in this regard, especially at this time of year.Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2673 shortchanges teachers and students, law enforcement personnel, and unemployed Missourians. Appropriations bills should speak to our priorities as a nation. I cannot support this measure that sets our country on a course of misplaced priorities.,2015-03-17 19:09:25.439631,2015-03-17 19:09:25.439631,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2673, CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004,2003-12-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-12-08/html/CREC-2003-12-08-pt1-PgH12766-2.htm,175,67,149,H12766-H12845,S000465,mr. skelton
2242,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,I appreciate the gentleman yielding.What is interesting about our Tax Code is it really does punish those who wish to save and invest. There are so many other nations that have a higher savings rate than the United States of America because we have built into our code, in fact, I am so familiar again with my 1040, having just spent so much time with it, line 8 of your 1040 says what was your interest income, put that here, because we are going to tax it. A lot of nations do not do that.So we have tried in various ways to help American families, especially as they look way down the road at retirement. We have a vexing problem ahead of us as far as the baby boomers retiring and the future solvency of Social Security. That is an issue for another day.But what we have done over the course of Congress, since 1997, as the gentleman recalls the significant tax relief that we passed back in 1997, that was actually signed into law by then President Clinton, we created some additional savings vehicles and tried to expand the opportunities for families to put money aside in 401(k) plans, or, as the gentleman knows, really a pet issue of mine, to help parents save for their childrens' education. Back in 1997, the idea was created of an education savings accounts. Now we have the ability, because of last summer's tax cut, the Bush tax cut, as the gentleman has referred to it, we have now given more flexibility to families to put money, or even neighbors or churches or businesses, to put money into a family's education account in the name of their child.It used to be pretty strict as to what that education account could be used for. Now we have some flexibility. Not only can you contribute more money into it, up to $2,000 a year, but it is not just for those students, those children who go to public college. It could be used for any educational expense for any child. It could be K through 12. It could be a tutor at school if you are having trouble with 4th grade math. It could be a computer program, it could be a foreign language skill or some help in that regard. It can be anything to help educate our kids.So this was a tremendous change, a positive change. We called it the Coverdell account in honor of the late Senator from Georgia who had first created this idea back in 1997 of putting aside money and letting the interest that is built up be tax free.I hesitate to think, I shudder to think, that if we do not make this tax cut permanent, that that flexibility is gone, the ability to contribute money into that education account, up to $2,000 a year, is gone.So the number of positive tax changes that we have helped create, in a bipartisan way, friends across the aisle have helped vote for it, worked for some of these items, those items would be no longer in the Tax Code. That positive tax relief would be obliterated if this House and Congress do not act to make the tax cut permanent.,2015-03-17 19:09:25.561717,2015-03-17 19:09:25.561717,House,MAKING PERMANENT THE BUSH TAX CUT,2002-04-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-16/html/CREC-2002-04-16-pt1-PgH1312.htm,42,22,148,H1312-H1318,H000948,mr. hulshof
2243,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, the Republican leadership has once again succeeded in bringing to the floor a labor, health and education appropriations bill designed to please only themselves and their right-wing friends. H.R. 4577 fails to make needed investments in public education and the domestic workforce, and, as the result, would undermine American competitiveness in the 21st century. This bill has already received what has now become its customary and well-deserved veto threat from the Clinton administration. It is clearly going nowhere, and should be soundly defeated.This bill was doomed from its inception, because the economic premise upon which it is based is flawed. Earlier this year, before the appropriations process began, the Republican leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich. They attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution. This decision to squander the surplus, rather than invest it, severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our nation's critical needs.Overall, the bill provides $2.9 billion less than the President requested for the Department of Education, and $1.7 billion less for the Department of Labor. As the result, education, job training, workplace safety, and other programs are either frozen or cut, significantly reducing the level of services that can be provided.For example, the bill would slash Title I funding, forcing school districts to cut back on assistance to disadvantaged students. The Clinton/Clay class size reduction initiative is gutted, leaving school districts without the resources to hire and train 20,000 more top-quality teachers. Adequate funding is denied for after-school and summer programs intended to improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime. And no funds are provided to renovate crumbling and unsafe schools.At the same time efforts are ongoing in the Congress to erase limits on the immigration of foreign workers to fill high-tech jobs, this bill would make steep cuts in the funding of training programs aimed at helping domestic workers fill them and other positions. Dislocated workers and at-risk youth are particularly hard hit by these cuts, even though they are the one most in need of skills training. By failing to adequately invest in our own workforce, the Republican leadership is jeopardizing American competitiveness and prosperity.This bill also jeopardizes worker health and safety by shortchanging OSHA and blocking issuance of the ergonomics rule intended to prevent about 300,000 workplace injuries a year. The Wilson amendment would add insult to injury by cutting $25 million more from OSHA.Mr. Chairman, this appropriations bill is a disaster. It fails to adequately invest in education, and in the development and security of the nation's workforce. I urge a no vote on H.R. 4577.,2015-03-17 19:09:25.751846,2015-03-17 19:09:25.751846,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-06-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-12/html/CREC-2000-06-12-pt1-PgH4194-5.htm,72,167,146,H4194-H4215,C000488,mr. clay
2244,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Madam Speaker, I deeply appreciate the comments that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), the Majority Leader, just made. I take very seriously the idea that he says that Republican Members of the House are concerned about the children and concerned about education. I accept that completely.I believe Members, all Members of this House want to improve the education and the upbringing of all of our children. That is a very important beginning agreement. We have a disagreement, obviously, about the role of vouchers and whether or not to take some of the money that we are spending on public education to give to vouchers that can be used in private and other schools. But we ought to build on our agreement rather than suffering from this ongoing disagreement.All of us want the children of the District of Columbia and every other jurisdiction in the country to succeed, to learn, to have proper values, to be productive, healthy citizens. That must be our number one goal. We believe that vouchers do not advance us toward that goal. Our concern, which is sincere and heartfelt, is that the children that are left behind will do worse, worse as a result of this legislation. Seventy-six thousand youngsters will not have the benefit of the vouchers. The 7,000 who get them may do better; they may not do better. But the 76,000 that are left behind will be hurt.Madam Speaker, what we should be talking about today are the kinds of things that the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has brought forward, creative ideas to improve public education. And I take seriously what the majority leader has said about accountability. We should be for accountability.I put in legislation I call ``Reward for Results.'' It says that Federal aid, at least part of Federal aid, ought to be conditioned upon a school achieving results. We should be able to find out if children can read, write and compute at certain ages. And we should, in my view, be willing to condition part of Federal aid on them being able to achieve those conclusions.What I would hope we could have here is a discussion between the parties on creative ideas to fix the public schools that do not work; to realize that most of the public schools do work and do a very good job, but the ones that do not, we cannot afford that result.So, I hope Members will vote against this idea of vouchers. I hope we will meet again and talk about creative ideas to fix the public schools, to make them accountable, to get the results that we need, to make sure that every child is a productive citizen.I am heartened by what the Majority Leader has said today. I think we can find an agreement. I do not think this is it. I urge Members to vote against this bill. I wish the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia had the ability to bring her motion to recommit today, and I hope that if we could defeat this bill we could come back with a bipartisan agreement on education that would move us in the right direction.,2015-03-17 19:09:25.874940,2015-03-17 19:09:25.874940,House,ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE,1998-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-30/html/CREC-1998-04-30-pt1-PgH2660.htm,51,38,144,H2660-H2671,G000132,mr. gephardt
2245,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that the conference report which accompanies H.R. 2646, the Education Savings and School Excellency Act, does not contain the provisions banning Federal funding for the President's federalized, individualized testing proposal. This provision, which I authored, has been removed in conference because of the clearly communicated concern that the President would veto the legislation based on this issue.The Senate and House have repeatedly given the administration a failing grade on respecting the role of parents, on local control of what is taught and how it is taught. The President has insisted on trying to promote federalized control of education. Federal testing would lead to a Federal curriculum.This administration has a lamentable record of harming the interests of American schoolchildren.For example, on school choice, the President wants to incarcerate America's most disadvantaged youngsters in dangerous, dysfunctional schools, rather than give them a choice of schools.On block grants, he wants to keep plowing taxpayer money into the bureaucracy, instead of investing more in our classrooms.Now, on school testing, he wants to cut the rug out from under the role of parents and communities--the most important factors in how well children do in schools.The more Members of this body have learned about the President's national testing proposal, the less they have liked it. Over the past year, the number of Senators opposing national testing has grown to a majority.When we first visited this issue last fall during debate on the Labor, HHS and educational appropriations bill, only 13 Senators voted against allowing the President's national testing proposal.Only one month later, 36 other Senators joined with me to threaten to filibuster the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill unless there was a ban on FY 1998 federal funding for the President's national testing proposal.In April of this year, when I offered my testing ban as an amendment to the Coverdell A+ bill, the Senate passed the provision by a vote of 52-47.Over in the House, Congressman Bill Goodling, Chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has continued to provide leadership in the fight against national testing. His bill to prohibit funds for national testing passed by a vote of 242-174 in February of this year.So it is clear that both Chambers of this Congress agree that national testing should be rejected. And the President of the United States wants to promote national testing, and does so, I believe, in an effort that would begin to nationalize the school system. Local control of schools is fundamentally important and should be protected. It is reflected in the understanding of the House and the Senate.The Senate Majority Leader and the Speaker of the House have provided to Chairman Goodling and me a written commitment that they will ensure that the text of the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill for 1999, and any supplemental or any other such legislation, will not leave Congress without a testing provision that Chairman Goodling and I find to be satisfactory. That, of course, would be a provision allowing no funds to develop national tests. If the appropriations bill does not make it to the President's desk, they say, then every effort will be made to include this in a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation.I appreciate this assurance from our leadership in both the House and Senate, and my colleagues can be sure that I will do everything in my power to hold them to their commitment.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter from the Major Leader and the Speaker to Chairman Goodling and me containing these assurances be printed in the Record after my remarks.,2015-03-17 19:09:26.317254,2015-03-17 19:09:26.317254,Senate,EDUCATIONAL SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT,1998-06-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-24/html/CREC-1998-06-24-pt1-PgS6918-2.htm,84,86,144,S6918-S6935,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2246,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct, so that we can rein in some of the excesses of the Republican budget, and stand up for working families for change.The fact is, when we talk about the budget, we're not talking about a bunch of numbers and spreadsheets. We're talking about real people's lives.We're talking about the elderly woman in my town of St. Louis, scraping by on Social Security, counting pennies at the end of the month--and already hard-pressed to survive the deep Republican cuts in Medicare.We're talking about the young couple that is trying desperately to save for their children's education, and for their own retirement.We're talking about the families that can no longer care for their parents and grandparents, but can't afford the $40,000-dollar-a-year price tag of a nursing home without any help.It's no secret that I strongly opposed this Republican budget, because it heaped all the budget cuts on those seniors and families--carving up Medicare and jacking up the premiums; cutting into education and college loans; paring back nursing home assistance to lavish more tax breaks on people who don't need them.But today, we have a chance to help the seniors, children, and families who should be the foundation of any budget proposal: To prevent some of the deep cuts in education, at a time when we need more education, not less of it; to protect seniors on Medicare from being overbilled by their health plans and providers, when many of them just don't have that extra money; To preserve the standards that say your whole family doesn't have to go bankrupt to put your parents in a nursing home; and to do more to protect the clean air and clean water and environmental decency that are central to America's health and safety.This bill would tell the Committee on the Budget negotiators that they have to back away from the House Republicans' radicalism on those crucial issues, and toward the greater reason and moderation of the U.S. Senate.The point of this bill is very simple: America's hard-working families matter more than any special-interest lobbyist.The House Republicans' dangerous budget policies and Medicare cuts--already vetoed twice by the President--don't deserve another revival.And together, we can start to make this a budget that actually works for working people.Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote for this motion--to protect seniors on Medicare, and preserve nursing home standards, and secure education and the environment. Even these changes won't make the Republicans' budget perfect, but it will send an important message.That today, this Congress votes for families, for a change.Support this motion to instruct.,2015-03-17 19:09:26.438338,2015-03-17 19:09:26.438338,House,APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 178, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 1997,1996-05-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-30/html/CREC-1996-05-30-pt1-PgH5725-3.htm,77,22,142,H5725-H5732,G000132,mr. gephardt
2247,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, this amendment relates to the education funding included in this budget proposal. I have joined with other Republican Senators in calling for an increase in Federal spending for education and urging that those additional dollars go directly to the classroom. This is a proposed sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I am offering this measure with Senator Gorton. It is a measure which already is at the desk.Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this budget is very generous in terms of education, providing additional resources for the purpose of enhancing the capacity of our students to perform.This budget provides, for instance, for my own State--I think if the money were to be divided equally between the States, Missouri would get $56 million next year, more than it gets now. Over the next 5 years, it would get about $660 million more. So that is a substantial increase in the resource.I have joined with Senator Gorton of Washington to say that when we have that kind of resource flowing to the States, it is important for us that this increased resource in Federal education dollars be directed to the States and local schools out of the Federal budget and not to the Federal bureaucracy.You see, our intention with this resource is to elevate the capacity of students to perform, not to elevate the capacity or the propensity of the bureaucracy to intermeddle in directing, and sometimes misdirecting, the resources that would otherwise be best directed at the local level.Our hope is that this additional resource will give States and local communities, will give teachers and principals, and will give people at the classroom level--places where decisions can be made effectively about allocation of the resources--the maximum flexibility to design and run education programs that will literally elevate performance of our students.One of our Nation's highest priorities is that every child would have the opportunity to receive the kind of challenging, rigorous education that would prepare them for not only success personally, but would also prepare them as team members of Team U.S.A. to keep America where it ought to be--leading the world.Congress should develop and support Federal policy that will best promote education practices that succeed in our States and schools. Sometimes those practices are different in one State than they would be in other States. So we really want to invite the States, the school boards, the parents, and the teachers, those whose children are in the schools, to participate in developing the right deployment of these resources--spending the money wisely in ways that will help the students.Successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement, where parents really care, where parents get involved with the school system, where they energize their children, where they assign a high value to achievement in education. That is where our children soar. We should have Federal policy that gives the parents, the schools, the school boards, the school districts, the local governments, and the States the right to tailor the expenditure of resources so as to meet the needs of our children. Successful schools are also characterized by fundamental skills, excellent teachers, dollars spent in the classroom, and not dollars wasted in the bureaucracy. So many of our current Federal educational resources are misspent. They drive a demand for paperwork. They don't drive a demand for performance. They don't contain elements that further our goal of giving our children a world-class education. A number of our Federal education programs contain these mountainous paperwork burdens--regulations and restrictions that hinder States' and local schools' ability to design programs.Here are a couple of examples about the bureaucracy. Listen to these numbers. They are almost mind staggering.In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in State funds. So it takes 374 to administer the $8 billion in State funds. However, there are 297 State employees needed to oversee only $1 billion in Federal funds, six times as many employees, six times as much bureaucracy, six times as much administration per dollar of funds spent in Federal dollars as there are for State dollars.I think if we want to avoid that kind of overlay of inefficiency, if we want to avoid the weight of paper that is weighing down the educational system that keeps teachers writing reports to bureaucrats instead of teaching our students, we ought to be working for this amendment which says that resources should go to State and local efforts; they should be tailored to meet the needs of the schools and to elevate student performance. The enhanced resources in this bill should not be devoted to the Federal bureaucracy where we have that 6-to-1 ratio demonstrated in the Florida experience where there are six times as many administrators for federal dollars as there are for State dollars.The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours of paperwork each year just to receive the Federal dollars. That translates into the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employees every year just doing the paperwork. This bureaucratic maze for Federal education bureaucracy takes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars.If I were to hand my son $1 and before it got from my hand to his it changed from $1 to 65 cents, I would hear about it. I would hear about it with justification--``You say you are giving me a dollar. You are only giving me 65 cents.'' That is what has been happening with Federal education dollars.The Governors of the country know about it. That is why they were so adamant in unanimously supporting the Ed-Flex bill which we passed in the Senate. Flexibility is important. That is what we would be providing to support student achievement if we are able to support this amendment.A recent example of inflexible Federal funding is the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for early elementary grades. It may have been a noble aspiration, but it may not be what some schools need.Listen to what Gov. Gray Davis, a Democratic Governor of California, recently said. He said it this way. His State had already achieved smaller classroom sizes in the early grades and needed to use the new Federal funds for reducing class size in 10th grade math and English classes. But no. The Federal bureaucrats and we, in conjunction with them, said no; this is only to be used in another specific arena.Let's give the flexibility to a school district, to the Governors, to teachers, to principals, to people at the local level. Let's give them the flexibility to meet student needs instead of to satisfy the bureaucratic demand. Why should we handcuff States and local schools from using money in the way they best see fit?According to the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress Reading Report Card, nearly 40 percent of our fourth grade students cannot even read at a basic level. United States 12th graders outperformed only 2 out of 21 nations in mathematics on a recent Third International Math and Science Study Test. The Brookings Institution has reported that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students who want to go to college. They have to have remedial work because it didn't happen at the elementary and secondary level.Let's not continue to spend money, Federal funds, in the old way of running it through the bureaucracy, first shrinking it and then allowing it to go from the bureaucracy forward in ways that aren't serving students. We should direct any new and existing Federal education resources to States and local schools to design and implement education programs that work, and that they know can work, because they are working with the program. And they also know what programs they need for their students.When Governor Gray Davis said he didn't need the money for smaller class sizes in early grades, he wasn't saying the program wouldn't work. He is just saying we already did that; we need to use the resource for something else.We cannot afford to keep spending our dollars in the same way that we have been doing for years. A profound friend of mine said, ``Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. If you do not like what you are getting, you had better change your system.''We can't do it the same way. It has been giving us the wrong results. Let's let States and local communities decide how to spend dollars to improve performance--not give us the same result but give us an elevated outcome.I think we should give States and local schools the kind of flexibility they need to spend Federal dollars on programs that are needed at the local level rather than programs that are mandated from the bureaucracy. I think we need programs that boost student achievement, and that somehow foster academic excellence, giving local individuals the right to deploy the resources to do that.Under this approach, schools will be able to deploy resources to hire new teachers and to raise teachers' salaries. They could buy textbooks, or new computers, enhance the library, or even build--do all kinds of things, whatever they believe is most important in order to achieve that fundamental goal that we will all agree we want to pursue: that is, elevated student performance.That is what education is for--not for the bureaucracy in Washington. It is not really even for the bureaucracies at the State level, or the school boards, or even for the teachers. Our education effort is designed to elevate the performance and capacity to build the future of the United States by enhancing the future of individual students.In conclusion, parents, teachers, school boards, and administrators are in the best position to say what is needed. You wouldn't think of going to a doctor who is 1,000 miles away who is prescribing only one thing for all the people in the country regardless of their symptoms. We would say that is the most foolish thing of all. Yet we go to the bureaucracy in Washington, have them prescribe what we are going to do with our educational resources, no matter what the situation is in the State, or the school, or the local school area, or in the classroom. We need the capacity to say, here is what is wrong. Let's make the diagnosis at the local level, and then let's get at the problem at the local level.We can provide those resources. The resources in this budget should be devoted to that. Senator Gorton of Washington has been a champion of this idea. Several years ago, really in a breakthrough in the Senate, we voted for this concept, and it was on his motion that we did so. I am pleased to join with him in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Sessions as a cosponsor of this amendment.

2248,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, last year, Congress passed the omnibus appropriations bill, making a $1.2 billion down payment on President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new classroom teachers. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans because overwhelming evidence demonstrates that students in smaller classes with qualified teachers have greater academic success, especially in the early grades.H.R. 1995, the Teacher Empowerment Act, threatens the future of this class size reduction program by allowing funds to be diverted to other uses without having to address the shame of overcrowded classrooms.Only on rare occasions have there been such unanimous opposition in the education community to a proposal such as this one. Every major education group has expressed strong opposition to abolishing the requirement to target funding for class size reduction.Now, Mr. Chairman, the people who drafted this bill are all isolated here in Washington, D.C. and want everybody to think that they have the answers to the problems in public education, but a sampling of such comments from people who are out there in the trenches, who are out there every day dealing with the problems of education, is something that we ought to pay attention to.The Council of Chief State School Officers say that they support the Martinez Democratic substitute because, and I quote, ``H.R. 1995 fails to ensure a stable and growing funding stream of resources for both professional development and class size reduction. The Martinez substitute would target Federal resources to two distinct but companion Federal priorities without making them compete against each other for a fixed pot of funds,'' end of quote.The National Education Association writes, and I quote, ``NEA strongly opposes provisions of H.R. 1995 to combine the class size reduction program with Goals 2000 and professional development programs. Combining class size reduction with other programs will serve merely to undermine its effectiveness by failing to achieve the goal of hiring 100,000 qualified teachers,'' end of quote.The National School Boards Association, representing thousands of school districts across the country, opposes the approach taken in this bill. They write, and I quote, Mr. Chairman, ``Much stronger legislation and far more targeted Federal dollars are needed if the Nation's public schools are to ensure that students, particularly those in poverty, have a real opportunity to improve student achievement. H.R. 1995 implies that America's school board members must make the unfortunate choice between access to high-quality teachers and access to an effective learning environment with a teacher ratio that research has proven is effective,'' end of quote.Other groups, Mr. Chairman, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Council of Great City Schools, the National Parent and Teachers Association, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights all strongly support a separate stream of funding for class size reduction.Finally, Mr. Chairman, President Clinton on the recommendation of Secretary Riley has issued a veto threat on this bill. All across the country children, parents, and teachers are counting on us to finish the job of reducing class sizes. The Martinez substitute that will be offered later today makes good on this commitment by continuing a separate stream of support for the Clay-Clinton Class Size Reduction Act.Mr. Chairman, too many of our students and teachers are now struggling in classrooms with as many as 35 children. We should not let them down. I urge support of the Martinez substitute and, if it fails, I urge rejection of H.R. 1995.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:26.961705,2015-03-17 19:09:26.961705,House,TEACHER EMPOWERMENT ACT,1999-07-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-20/html/CREC-1999-07-20-pt1-PgH5856-2.htm,103,67,145,H5856-H5919,C000488,mr. clay
2249,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a native St. Louisan, Dr. Henry Givens, Jr., who has served as president of Harris-Stowe State University since it became a state institution in 1979. He was educated in the St. Louis public schools and earned his baccalaureate degree at Lincoln University in Missouri. He earned his master's degree at the University of Illinois and his Ph.D. at Saint Louis University. His postdoctoral studies in higher education administration were at Harvard University.Dr. Givens' professional experience in education is both broad and varied. He began his career as a teacher in the Webster Groves School District and became principal of the first prototype of a magnet school in the nation. Before leaving the Webster Groves public schools, he held the post of Assistant to the Superintendent of Schools. Soon after, he became the first African-American to serve Missouri as Assistant Commissioner of Education, which he did for 5 years.At the request of the Governor of Missouri, Dr. Givens served as interim president at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, MO, during a financial crisis in 1987, while continuing his duties at Harris-Stowe. Such an appointment was without precedent in Missouri public higher education.Under the leadership of Dr. Givens, Harris-Stowe has greatly expanded its degree programs; has significantly increased its facilities--from one building to seven, and including, for the first time in its long history of over 150 years, the new state-of-the-art William L. Clay, Sr. Early Childhood Development/Parenting Education Center and the Rev. Dr. William G. Gillespie Residence Hall and Student Center. An eighth new building, a second residence hall, is currently under construction. In addition, Harris-Stowe has opened its first business school satellite campus in South St. Louis; has expanded the University's academic program to include 14 degree offerings in selected applied professional disciplines; has tripled its student enrollment since entering the State System; and has changed its status from College to University, to name a few of its accomplishments.Dr. Givens has served as Chairman of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Statewide Celebration Commission for Missouri since its inception in 1986 to 2011. Under his dynamic leadership, the State of Missouri now hosts the second-largest celebration in the nation, extending to every corner of Missouri. Dr. Givens was appointed by President Barack Obama to the HBCU Capital Finance Program Advisory Board, and has served in the past and present on local, national, and international groups as a consultant, including the U.S. State Department at its American School in Lima, Peru. In addition, he currently serves on several local, state and national Boards and Commissions. He serves on the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority board, and on local and national Corporate Boards of Directors, including, U.S. Bank (Regional).He is a past board member of Laclede Gas/Laclede Group, Peabody Energy, Inc., and Automobile Club of Missouri (AAA). President Givens is affiliated with numerous national and local professional and social organizations, and has received over 125 national, state and local awards and recognitions, including honorary doctorate degrees from Saint Louis University, Lincoln University and Washington University-St. Louis.Dr. Givens is married to Belma Evans Givens. They have a daughter, a son, and three grandchildren. ,2015-03-17 19:09:27.082791,2015-03-17 19:09:27.082791,Extensions,HONORING HENRY GIVENS, JR., PH.D., PRESIDENT, HARRIS-STOWE STATE UNIVERSITY, SAINT LOUIS, MISSOURI,2011-09-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-09-09/html/CREC-2011-09-09-pt1-PgE1587-3.htm,133,0,157,E1587-E1588,C001049,mr. clay
2250,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, in introducing the Real AMT Relief Act of 2001. This bill focuses on an issue of growing concern to many individual taxpayers and especially small business owners, the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT.The Real AMT Relief Act addresses the increasingly onerous consequences of the individual AMT as well as the corporate AMT. According to the Joint Tax Committee, in 1998, the most recent taxpayer data available, there were 853,000 individual tax returns that paid AMT. That number constituted 0.7 percent of all individual income tax returns--a relatively small number of returns. In contrast, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that by 2011, 11.2 percent of individual income tax returns will have AMT liability, that's more than 16 million taxpayers who will have to grapple with this burdensome tax.Sadly, many of these AMT taxpayers will be individuals in the middle income brackets and not because they are taking advantage of special tax loopholes to avoid paying their share of taxes. No, these hardworking men and women will be hit with the AMT because they are taking advantage of the tax benefits that Congress accorded them, such as the child tax credit, the adoption tax credit, the dependent care tax credit, and the HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit, to name a few. So instead of receiving a few extra dollars to help raise their children, these taxpayers lose much of these benefits and get to deal with the complex AMT rules as a bonus prize.For other taxpayers, the AMT will not increase their tax bill. But because the AMT is a separate tax system, they will have to calculate their taxes twice, once under the regular rules and a second time under the AMT, just to make sure they do not owe additional taxes. With an already complicated set of tax rules for the regular tax, the last thing these individuals need is a second set of calculations.Another significant group of taxpayers who have largely been forgotten in the AMT debate are the small business owners. According to recent IRS estimates, there were more than 20.7 million tax returns filed by sole-proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations with receipts of less than $1 million. In contrast, there were 2.75 million C corporations. As a result, a whopping 88 percent of these businesses, with receipts under $1 million, are pass-through entities, businesses that are taxed only at the individual owner level.For these sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, the individual AMT increases their tax liability by, among other things, reducing depreciation and depletion deductions, limiting net operating loss treatment, eliminating the deductibility of State and local taxes, and curtailing the expensing of research and experimentation costs. In addition, because of its complexity, this tax forces small business owners to waste precious funds on tax professionals to determine whether the AMT even applies. Just think of the economic growth and new jobs that could be created if we could eliminate the compliance costs of the individual AMT.The Real AMT Relief Act does just that. Based on the recommendation of the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate in his 2001 Report to Congress, the bill provides for the complete repeal of the individual AMT. This will be accomplished by eliminating 20 percent of the AMT each year until it is completely repealed in 2006. That's welcome relief for individual taxpayers and an enormous burden lifted off the shoulders of America's small businesses.For small corporations, the AMT story is much the same, high compliance costs and additional taxes draining away scarce capital from their businesses. In fact, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, received testimony at a hearing in the last Congress that the corporate AMT resulted in a $95,000 tax bill for one small business in Kansas City, all because the company purchased life insurance on the father, who was the primary owner of the business, to prevent the estate tax from closing the company down. That type of nonsense must come to an end here and now.In 1997, Congress established an exemption from the corporate AMT for small businesses that are organized as taxable corporations if they meet certain gross receipt tests. Under that exemption, a corporation initially qualifies if its average gross receipts were $5 million or less during its first three taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. Thereafter, a small corporation can continue to qualify for the AMT exemption for so long as its average gross receipts for the prior three-year period do not exceed $7.5 million.With the growth and success of small corporations, it is time to expand that exemption and continue to provide these small enterprises with relief from the corporate AMT. Accordingly, for small corporate taxpayers, the Real AMT Relief Act increases the current exemption from the corporate AMT. As a result, a small corporation will initially qualify for the exemption if its average gross receipts are $7.5 million or less during its first three taxable years. In subsequent years, a small corporation will continue to qualify for as long as its average gross receipts for the prior 3-year period do not exceed $10 million. By Mr. COCHRAN:S. 617. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve student and teacher performance and access to education in the critically challenged Lower Mississippi Delta region; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, today I am introducing the Lower Mississippi Delta Education Access and Improvement Act of 2001.The character and fabric of our Nation have been significantly enhanced by the Mississippi Delta's unique blend of the talents that created blues music and Pulitzer Prize literature. But the problems facing this region today overshadow the triumphs of the past and foretell a future without hope. These problems include: below average reading skills among elementary school children, low graduation rates and ACT scores among high school students, lower levels of accreditation among teachers, and poor scores from the State Department of Education Performance Based Accreditation System. Poverty is another issue facing the school districts, evidenced by the fact that 86 percent of the students are eligible for free lunch.However, there is a sense of optimism among community leaders and educators about overcoming the difficulties that confront the educational system of the area. Universities, community based organizations, and schools are developing comprehensive initiatives to achieve new success in teacher training and retention, preschool learning readiness, parental education, school-wide performance, birth to kindergarten preventative health care and immunization delivery. These are the people who best know their problems, and more importantly, how to solve them. In my opinion, these are efforts that deserve federal support.This bill will authorize grants to institutions of higher learning located in the Lower Mississippi Delta for the improvement of education and student and teacher performance.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,Title XIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:Title XIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Part E--Lower Mississippi Delta Education Access and Improvement,2015-03-17 19:09:27.205880,2015-03-17 19:09:27.205880,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2001-03-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-26/html/CREC-2001-03-26-pt1-PgS2895.htm,41,14,147,S2895-S2904,B000611,mr. bond
2251,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, when the Black Leadership Forum decided to finance the settlement of the Taxman v. Pascataway, many outside the civil rights community asked ``why?''. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments and the case was said to be perfect for an argument in defense of affirmative action--both applicant were allegedly ``equally'' qualified. This was a total distortion of the facts. The candidates were NOT equally qualified. Debra Williams, the African-American teacher, had significantly higher academic credentials than did the other teacher. I submit an insightful column that accurately sets forth the real issue in the Piscataway case. The column was written by the distinguished economist, columnist, and educator Dr. Julianne Malveaux and appeared in the December 11, 1997 issue of Black Issues in Higher Education.The Black Leadership Forum--an organization that includes the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Urban League, the National Council of Negro Women, and others--deflected energy from the controversial Taxman v. Piscataway case that the Supreme Court had committed to hear this session. The forum agreed to finance 70 percent of the nearly $450,000 settlement that the plaintiff and her lawyers will receive from the Piscataway school board. Sharon Taxman was the White business education teacher who was laid off in a downsizing while Debra Williams, an African American business education teacher, was retained. Since the two women were hired the same day and deemed ``equally'' qualified, the school board justified retaining Williams on the basis of ``diversity.'' Faster than she could spell diverse, Taxman was filing a lawsuit. Her quest for ``equality'' was affirmed by every court up to the Supreme Court, which had agreed to hear her case. Civil rights activists thought this was the wrong one to take to the nation's highest court, so they bought Taxman out. I'm not sure how I feel about the buy-out. It's like postponing something tragic--in this case, the apathy that comes from a Supreme Court which appears to be indifferent to diversity as well as equality. But I am convinced that there are at least two villains in this story--and one of them is the Piscataway School Board. Come again? To some, these guys seem like the good guys. They retained an African American teacher and laid off a White one, upholding diversity. At the same time, though, they tragically argued that two workers were ``equally'' qualified when one held a master's degree while the other had a lesser education. If we were Debra Williams I'd be fuming through the ears. The myth that hard work and the quest for education would give you a leg up was busted in her case. Rather than the school board affirming her superior education, they told her that her master's degree was not worth enough for her to be considered more than equally qualified over a colleague with less education. (I almost typed inferior for less, but that is the oppressor's game.) A careful examination of what happened in Piscataway explains why affirmative action has become America's whipping post. Instead of White employers telling White employees that they aren't competitive, the White employees are told that a position was assigned or retained because of affirmative action. That is the kind of lazy dishonesty that fuels the myth of White superiority. Consider Proposition 209. We all know that it was championed by Republicans Pete Wilson and Ward Connerly, but the early poster boys were two White men who presented themselves as academics and said they could not find jobs in the California State University system, despite their ``qualifications.'' To be sure, these men both had Ph.D. degrees. However, neither had earned academic distinction. They were not published, nor had they ever actually applied for jobs in the California state system--a fact uncovered in a blistering report by investigative journalists. Nonetheless, one of these men said he could not find a job as a philosophy teacher in California. In the year he said he looked, five philosophers were hired, and three were White men. But he didn't challenge their status. There was an eminently qualified White woman hired, and he didn't challenge her status either. And an African American woman, also hired, was not the target of his ire. Where was this undistinguished, unpublished, nonapplying product of our nation's system of higher education supposed to get a job? It didn't matter. In his warped mind, some mythical Black person was out there holding his job--and by golly, he was going to make affirmative action beneficiaries pay. Thus, Proposition 209. Enter the second villain of this New Jersey-spawned affair. Taxman must have her head in the sand. Hasn't she ever heard that people lose their jobs. Spit happens, and the best thing to do with spit is to wash it off and move on. Instead, she put her life on hold, apparently because she could not stand the notion that some Black woman should get a job she thought she should have. Never mind that the Black woman, her colleague, had more education. Never mind that her colleague was the better teacher. Taxman is White and she has wrapped herself in the privilege of Whiteness. Thus, her lawsuit. The Supreme Court wouldn't see that because they are mostly White, too. Those who opposed Taxman would have had to overcome both the Court's distaste for affirmative action-- and its pejorative description of such policies as ``race- based preferences''--as well as a fealty to Whiteness. The civil rights community bought Taxman off because they understood that the Piscataway school board improperly packaged this case, choosing affirmative action and diversity as the wrong reasons to let an inferior teacher go. If the school board had looked more carefully at the two women and their qualifications, this case may not have gone to court. There's the rub. Spit happens. Downsizing takes place. What the Taxman case has said so far is that when downsizing doesn't fall on the shoulders of Black people, White people are ready to go to court. Or when all else is supposedly equal, White folks are supposed to prevail. This is a premise that deserves challenge. But then there are others, such as the premise that a White woman's bachelor's degree is the equivalent of a Black woman's master's. That is only the case in a racist society.,2015-03-17 19:09:27.328973,2015-03-17 19:09:27.328973,Extensions,THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TAXMAN V.

2252,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I want to share with my colleagues some concerns and views on this very important piece of legislation, S. 717, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. I express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the committee for the good work he and the ranking member and the entire committee have done on this bill.We all know that since the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, tremendous improvements have been made in the lives of millions of children with disabilities, providing them with a full array of outstanding educational services to meet their individual needs.Mr. President, going back about a year before that, in the State of Missouri, when I was Governor, we passed our Special Education Act in 1974, one of the first major pieces of legislation adopted during my first term as Governor. House bill 474 was an effort at the State level to assure that children with disabilities received educational opportunities and received educational services that were designed to meet their abilities and to compensate for any difficulties or deficiencies they might have.I think it is clear that we have come a long way. Clearly, there was much that needed to be done, and many of those children, with grave needs, were not being taken care of, they were not being served, and certainly they have a right to be served.I think as we move through this bill, preserving the rights of special-needs children to a free appropriate public education so that they can become productive and responsible citizens is an absolutely essential goal that we must keep in mind.I have had the opportunity to hear from many, many groups in Missouri who are concerned about how this bill is being carried out, how IDEA is being implemented. Without dissent, there is unanimous agreement that the goals are worthy, the objectives are right, the need is there, more needs to be done. Unfortunately, because of the way the law has been carried out, the way it has been interpreted, there are disruptions to classrooms, there is needless danger to other students and to teachers in the classroom, and there is also a shortage of funds to carry out the worthwhile objectives of this act.As I traveled throughout Missouri over the last couple of weekends when I was home, I talked with school superintendents, principals, school board members, special education directors, parents and others who are concerned, and the two top concerns that were mentioned just about every place I went was safety and discipline for all students in the public school system.The number of instances where there have been serious disruption and violent acts on students was hair raising. There was a lot of interest and focus in the St. Louis area on a tragic murder that occurred in one of the schools. A young woman was brutally beaten to death. It turns out that the young man who commited the crime was a young man with disabilities. He had transferred into that school district from another school district where he had been cited many times for bad behavior. The receiving school district did not know anything about his past activities because they did not know about his behavioral problems. So the first thing they requested was that they get information on a student's past activities, if there has been discipline, what the discipline had been and why the discipline was administered.Second, they told me some hair-raising stories about children with disabilities who committed violent acts. In one classroom, in a commercial art class, a young man picked up a knife and stabbed a fellow student several times and told the school administrators that since he qualified under a certain specific section of the act, they couldn't do anything to him, that they could only take him out of the classroom for 10 days, and then he would be back in there.They told me about another student, one of two students, who had been apprehended for selling drugs. The one student who did not have a disability was expelled for 175 days. The other student, a year later, was still in the classroom. His parents had retained an attorney, which the school district was paying for, and they carried on the process. A year later, that student who sold the drugs was still in the classroom.Earlier, I introduced legislation, the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, which is designed to do a couple of things: No. 1 is to create a safe learning environment for all children. We have to continue to provide support and assistance for disabled students, but where there is a clear-cut example of behavior that is incompatible with a decent learning environment, the schools have to be able to take some action. One principal told us, ``You cannot learn in chaos. A child cannot learn in chaos. A teacher cannot teach in chaos.''When they have students with disabilities whose violent acts have been judged to be a manifestation of their disability and they have to come back into the classroom after 10 days, other students live in fear, teachers are apprehensive about the impact on their class and, according to the teachers, the administrators, the parents, the job of education comes to a halt.The measure that I introduced, the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, will eliminate the double standard that currently exists between special education and general education children. All children, disabled or not, should receive the same discipline for the same behavior. I believe this is appropriate wherein the behavior of the child is not related to the disability. Children must learn that there are consequences for violating the rules. Good education means discipline and standards of conduct. If there is a violent act that is a manifestation of the disability, if it is a dangerous act, if it is a violent act, then that child ought to be put in a learning situation where there will not be a danger to fellow students of committing a similar act.In addition, this measure would require schools to include in the record of a child with a disability a statement of any disciplinary action taken against the student, and that should be available for a student transferring within a State or from State to State, so that the receiving school will know if there are problems with the student who has come to them.The record issue, as I indicated previously, has been brought to the forefront because of the tragic murder of a young woman in north St. Louis County.This measure that I have proposed will enable the school administrators to remove dangerous children with disabilities who pose a threat to the safety of others from the classroom and make temporary alternative placements to ensure that the safety of all students is secure until a more appropriate placement is determined.In addition, the current IDEA provision requiring local school districts to reimburse attorneys fees incurred by parents who elect to initiate litigation has had what, unfortunately, is a predictable result of encouraging litigation and of driving up special education costs. It appears that the dispute-resolution procedures have become extremely adversarial and costly. Studies have found that the amount of special education litigation has dramatically increased in recent years. Too often, the litigation can be used as a fishing expedition to threaten districts with protracted litigation.The practice serves to reduce district funds available to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and we clearly need reforms of the dispute-resolution process to ensure that scarce educational funds are used for educational services for the children for whom they were intended. But because of the explosion of litigation in this area, educational services for students are put at risk.Under the measure I introduced, local school districts would be permitted to provide alternative education placements to children who threaten the safety of others. For some children, it is absolutely appropriate to remove them swiftly and permanently from the regular classroom setting. And under the law that I proposed, school officials would be permitted, on their own authority, to discipline dangerous and unruly students.Again, the measure I introduced would give the school districts the authority and flexibility to ensure that the students and the personnel are provided educational and working environments that are safe and orderly.Finally, I point out that when the Federal Government enacted IDEA, it promised to fund 40 percent of the national average per-pupil expenditure. Today, the Federal Government funds only 7 percent. That is why I am very pleased today to join with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, to provide in this legislation explicit direction to Congress to fund fully IDEA.I congratulate the committee and its leadership for having made so many necessary reforms in the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I hope we can take the next very important step and assure the funding. Congress only recently has come up with 7 percent of the funding rather than 40 percent.Last week, a major network news story featured a story on a school in my home State in Maryville, MO. The Maryville R-II School District did not have the revenue to repair its deteriorating classrooms. After six unsuccessful attempts to pass local bond issues, the district was able to pass a bond issue to renovate the schools.The Maryville school district spends approximately $434,800 on special education, of which $68,200 is Federal funds, all of which is spent on mandates. If the district were not bound by the paperwork requirements and other costly mandates of the law, they would have more money to improve their facilities and their classrooms.The skyrocketing costs of our special-needs children being served by IDEA places local school districts in a bind with little assistance from the Federal Government.An Economic Policy Institute study on school funding found that new money for education went disproportionately to fund deficits in special education funding caused by increasing requirements for services coupled with the Federal failure to meet its promised commitment.We have been in this body in an effort sometimes called devolution, sometimes called enhanced federalism, more often, in my view, called the commonsense approach of letting the level of Government which delivers the service make the decisions.Over the last few years, it says we ought to be allowing the school district if it is an educational decision, or the water district if it is a water-related problem, or the justice system if it is a justice problem make the decisions of how it works.We need to be providing more resources and less good ideas to local governments. That is particularly important in this field with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I can tell you that the goals and the objectives are understood, they are strongly felt by the people who serve in the school system and who support the school system, but they have too many requirements that prevent them from getting the job done. That is why I think we need to provide some flexibility for local school districts. We need to reestablish and restore to local school districts, to school administrators, and others the ability to use common sense in maintaining discipline and order and safety in the classroom.We also in this body need to step up to the plate and make sure that we come through with the funding that is needed to carry out these mandates.When I talked with the school principals, administrators, and teachers, I said, ``After what you have told me, we need to give you some freedom to do these things.'' They said, ``Well, how about a little money to help us with the burdens you put on us?'' I said, ``That makes sense.'' They said, ``Look, to handle these children with disabilities who are violent, we need to have the resources to provide them the alternative education which is appropriate for them and which will not subject their fellow students to risks.'' It is going to be more expensive, and there is not the money there yet.I am hoping that if we can increase the funding that is needed for these services, we are going to see not only order and discipline and conduct restored in the normal classrooms but a much higher quality of educational services delivered to the children with disabilities.Again, I commend and thank the committee for making the many reforms it has done in this bill. And I say that the School Improvement Security Act of 1997, which I described briefly, most of which is very significantly incorporated in this measure--I have been advised that the following organizations strongly support the provisions of it: The Missouri School Boards Association, the Missouri Association of Elementary School Principals, the Missouri Association of Secondary Principals, the Missouri State Teachers Association, the Missouri Federation of Teachers &amp; School Related Personnel, the Fort Zumwalt School District.I think, I say to the chairman, that we could get a list a half-mile long of organizations in my State that are behind you in the efforts to reform and reauthorize this measure. I know they are going to be behind Senator Gregg's and my efforts to get more funding.So I congratulate you on the measure. We look forward to working with you. We want to see if there is a way that we can provide the funding that is so badly needed for this very important service and for the well-being of the entire educational system in our country.I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished managers of the bill.I yield the floor.Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:09:27.473069,2015-03-17 19:09:27.473069,Senate,INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-05-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-05-12/html/CREC-1997-05-12-pt1-PgS4295-3.htm,61,45,143,S4295-S4311,B000611,mr. bond
2253,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the many accomplishments of Catholic schools. On January 26 the annual weeklong national recognition of Catholic schools began across the Nation. I am proud to have several of the nation's high achieving Catholic schools in my district in metropolitan Kansas City, Missouri. As a former educator I understand the importance of recognizing the achievements of education throughout our Nation, and I welcome this opportunity to applaud the Catholic school community nationwide.For 165 years, the Catholic schools of the Kansas City Diocese have prepared thousands of competent young adults fully for lives as productive citizens. There are over 40 Catholic education centers in metropolitan Kansas City, and they are all known for their high academic standards and rigorous educational instruction. These centers currently serve 14,000 students in my district. Every day over 1,000 dedicated faculty offer the guidance and instruction that make these students some of the best the Nation has to offer. Not only do the metropolitan Kansas City Catholic schools promote excellence in the classroom, they also encourage community service. In the first semester of this school year, our 14,000 students offered 87,978 hours of service to their communities by working to combat hunger and to provide care for the elderly.One of the brightest educational beacons in the Kansas City Diocese is St. Elizabeth School in Kansas City. They are recipients of the prestigious Blue Ribbon Award from the United States Department of Education. The award recognizes St. Elizabeth's for exceeding local, State, and national education goals. I participated in the announcement of this award and was overjoyed to see the level of excellence embodied throughout the school. They expressed their gratitude by giving me a remembrance of our day together: a Kelly green sweatshirt that I cherish, especially in St. Patrick's Day parades.St. Teresa's Academy, another blue ribbon school of excellence in my community, is the oldest school and women's institution in Kansas City. The school was founded and is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet who, since their founding in the 17th century in France, have been in the forefront of preparing young women for the future.I had the pleasure of accompanying the Secretary of Education, Roderick Paige, to St. Francis Xavier School in Kansas City, St. Francis is one of the seven Central City Catholic Schools established by the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph to provide educational support to children of the urban core of Kansas City. It serves a diverse population of students, some of whom are Catholic, but all come to receive their outstanding educational instruction offered as a part of the St. Francis Xavier curriculum. There is also a commitment to serving the whole child. More than half of the students at St. Francis qualify for free or reduced lunch. The school also participates in partnership with community organizations, including the Rockhurst University School of Education for teacher and parent training; Rockhurst High School in establishing a ``Middle School Academy'' to align curriculum, share resources, and setting up a mentoring program; and Young Audiences, to enrich the curriculum through the arts by having visual and performing artists work with teachers. St. Francis is part of the President's Service alliance and all students are required to perform community service. St. Francis students get real life experiences as part of their curriculum through partnerships the teachers establish with the community. The students also have a connection to students in the global society fostering the development of cultural awareness.I have also visited St. Thomas More School for a presentation by 6th Graders on the Federal minimum wage. This was part of a class project titled ``That is Not Fair,'' a program which emphasizes social justice issues. I was accompanied by Brigid Flanigan, principal; Leanna Kilgore, Cindy Rapp, Barbara Mingori, and Paula Pawlewicz, 6 grade teachers; Ann Harbin, facilitator of the ``That's Not Fair program; and Michael Poulin, social justice program coordinator. After listening to the presentation and hearing the students' hopes and aspirations of the future I challenged the students to reach high and achieve their goals. With the first rate education provided by St. Thomas More and throughout the Kansas City Diocese, there is no question that they will be prepared to do just that.Mr. Speaker, these are but a few of the Catholic schools in metropolitan Kansas City which play an important role in gifting students with the abilities to excel academically, socially, and civically. And I ask all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating the legacy and the bright future of the Catholic schools in the 5th District of Missouri and of the Nation.,2015-03-17 19:09:27.683219,2015-03-17 19:09:27.683219,House,HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2003-01-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-01-27/html/CREC-2003-01-27-pt1-PgH143-7.htm,14,17,149,H143-H147,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2254,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, as we gather in the House chamber with tremendous sadness over the passing of our dear friend and colleague, the Honorable Patsy Mink of Hawaii, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the career of a distinguished public servant who dedicated her life to the people of Hawaii and the United States.Patsy graduated valedictorian of her Maui High School class and received a bachelor's degree in zoology and chemistry from the University of Hawaii and a law degree from the University of Chicago, graduating as only one of two women in a class of 200. She practiced law and turned her sights to public service while mobilizing the Democratic party to take control of the Hawaii territorial government in the mid-1950s. From that time, Patsy served as an elected representative in the territorial and state legislatures, a city councilwoman, a federal official, and a Member of Congress.In Congress, as a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, she consistently championed legislation that would improve education, child care, welfare, and gender equality. Patsy was an especially fierce advocate for women's issues and was instrumental in the creation of Title 9 of the federal education act, which has opened many opportunities for women athletes in schools and colleges across America.Patsy also cared deeply about the men and women who serve in our nation's military. The State of Hawaii and its citizens play an instrumental role in advancing U.S. national security presence throughout the Pacific region. As a representative from Hawaii Patsy recognized the important military function in her state, and promoted the welfare of our troops and their families.As members of the House pay tribute to the legacy of this stateswoman, we should also take a moment to thank Patsy's staff in Washington and in Hawaii for their hard work and dedication. Because Patsy's office neighbors mine in the Rayburn building, I have seen her staff members burning the midnight oil on more than one occasion. With several time zones between Washington and Hawaii, they have often worked long hours to get the job done.Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Patsy Mink was a remarkable person who always stood for what she believed. She was a strong, brave American who is a role model for women throughout the nation. Most importantly, however, Patsy was a dear friend, and I will miss her. My wife Susie and I offer our condolences to Patsy's husband, John, and to their daughter Wendy.Mr. DAVIS of Illinois, Mr. Speaker, for those who knew her, Patsy Mink was a tiny woman physically. But don't let appearances fool you--Patsy Mink was a giant. This Nation has lost a great public servant and a true crusader for social justice. For 74 years, every time she came to a door that was slammed tightly closed--for no good reason--she used those tiny feet of hers to kick it open--and to let others follow behind her.And those who benefited from her tenacity have not forgotten Patsy Mink's pioneering steps. The National Organization for Women, in its tribute to Representative Mink, wrote ``Girls and women . . . lost one of their most valiant and steadfast champions. Every woman today who is enjoying the fruits of her education and job opportunities, and every girl who has a chance to play sports in school, owes a nod of thanks to Mink who unremittingly and dauntlessly challenged old stereotypes about `women's place' and helped engineer the steady progress for women over the last four decades--parallel to Mink's career in politics.''Patsy Mink was born in Maui, Hawaii, in December 1927, and began her political career when she ran for and won the election for student body president during her junior year in high school--she was the first girl to run. She later went on to graduate as the class valedictorian of Maui High School--but her academic achievement became less important than her race and sex when she set off to college. She attended Wilson College, in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and then the University of Nebraska, where she faced segregated student housing. Patsy Mink worked with others to end this discriminatory policy. She returned to finish her studies in chemistry and zoology from the University of Hawaii in 1948, with full intentions of attending medical school. However, 20 medical schools rejected her--obviously, it was not because of her grades, but because they would not accept women.She then decided to go to law school, and graduated with her J.D. degree in 1951 from the University of Chicago. Ironically enough, she was accepted into the school because they hadn't realized that Hawaii was an American territory at the time, and she was accepted as a foreign student!Armed with her law degree, Patsy Mink returned to Hawaii and became the first Asian American woman to practice law, the first Asian American woman elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, and then the first Asian American woman to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. For 24 years over two different periods she served in this body, and was re-elected two years ago by two-to-one margin. Incidentally, when she arrived in Congress, she wasn't allowed in the House gym because it was a male-only venue.As a champion for civil rights, family rights, education, civil liberties, and equal rights and opportunities, Rep. Mink will be remembered for many things. She wrote the Women's Educational Equity Act, sponsored the first Early Childhood Education Act, and was a passionate advocate for poor families, supporting measures to provide education and skills to assist families. However, her most crowning achievement was Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By prohibiting schools that receive Federal funding from discriminating because of sex, Title IX has singularly been credited with changing the face of education and sports for American women--and opening up many of those closed doors. There are many who believe we would not have seen such a rise in women's athletics were it not for Title IX.Rep Mink said of Title IX: ``It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition . . . To be frank, I thought this was great, a beginning statement of policy and intent. At the moment we were doing it, we didn't think it would have this fantastic momentum and the enforcement of the courts.''I think The Honolulu Advertiser summed it up right when it said: ``In a day when politics appears driven by polls and focus groups, Mink stood out as a politician who was true, first and foremost, to herself and the people she served.''I will truly miss working with Patsy Mink, but I am honored to have served with her. She set the standard for public servants, and leaves some very big shoes to fill.,2015-03-17 19:09:27.850344,2015-03-17 19:09:27.850344,House,EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PATSY T.

2255,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing two major education bills that address both elementary and secondary, and higher education.Last week I cosponsored President Clinton's Hope Scholarship proposal because I support the President's commitment to help parents finance their kids' education. Admittedly, I have concerns that the President's plan does not provide enough assistance for low-income families.My view is that the most fair and effective way to improve college access and affordability for low-income families is through strengthening the Pell Grant program. That is why today I will introduce the College Access and Affordability Act of 1997.As the chart to my immediate right illustrates, the value of Pell Grants has substantially decreased in recent years. In current dollars, the value of the maximum Pell Grant was over $4,000. Sadly, it is only $2,700 today. Our bill increases the maximum Pell Grant through mandatory spending to $3,300 for fiscal year 1998, and $300 a year thereafter, through fiscal year 2002. The net effect of the fiscal year 1998 increase would be that 3.6 million additional students would receive an increase of up to $600, and an additional 215,000 families would become newly eligible for Pell.My bill contains a number of other very important features including elimination of student loan origination fees, loan forgiveness for students who take teaching jobs in low-income public schools, and extension of special rules afforded historically black colleges and universities with regard to participation in student loan programs, and also included in here is a change to the Pell needs analysis that will help older, independent students and students working their way through college.My second proposal addresses the growing movement in local communities to recognize that some of our public schools need renewal. Those pushing vouchers are capitalizing on growing parental anxiety about their children's education. As a supporter of public schools, I am not content with just saying no to vouchers. Therefore, the second bill I will introduce today is the Public Schools Renewal and Improvement Act of 1997. Here are some of its key features: A local consortium, composed of the local educational agency and a group of parents, students, representatives of teachers and school employees, community and business leaders and others, may submit a request to the President for a declaration that a major public schools renewal effort is underway in that community.As part of its request, the consortium must prepare and submit a 3-year locally inspired public schools renewal plan that spells out specific details concerning the consortium's commitment to public school renewal in such areas as parental involvement, training of teachers, administrators and counselors, technology enhancements, school and classroom safety, and truancy and drop-out prevention.The President, along with the Secretary of Education, may approve the consortium's request for assistance and may direct various types of Federal assistance, including not just dollars, but also equipment, infrastructure improvements, et cetera.My bill is a 3-year effort and I am requesting $750 million for the first and second years. I intend to pursue passage of both bills at every opportunity, including work on the budget and higher education reauthorization.Increases Pell Grants. The bill increases the maximum Pell Grant through mandatory spending to $3,300 for FY 1998, and $300 a year thereafter through FY 2002. The FY 98 increase would make over 3.6 million students eligible to receive an increase of up to $600 and make an additional 215,000 families newly eligible for Pell grants. The value of Pell grants has substantially decreased in recent years as appropriation levels have lagged behind increases in college costs and authorization levels. Ten years ago, Pell grants covered an average of 55 percent of a student's college costs at a public university. Today, it covers less than 40 percent. The bill will greatly enhance access and affordability to millions of low income students pursuing higher education. Eliminates Student Fees. Student origination fees are reduced from 3 percent to 2 percent on July 1, 1998; to 1 percent in 2000; to zero after January 1, 2002. The current 1 percent insurance premium is eliminated on July 1, 1998. These savings will provide significant benefits to all students, and will provide additional funds to borrowers up front, at the time the loan funds are needed to pay for the cost of attendance. Provides Loan Forgiveness for New Teachers. The bill allows new teachers in Title 1 school with a high concentration of poor students (30 percent) to have their Direct or FFEL loans forgiven. Eligible teachers would have 15 percent of their loans forgiven in the first and second years of teaching; 20 percent in the third and fourth year; and 30 percent in the fifth year. The amount of the loan forgiveness is not considered ``income'' for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Helps Older, Independent Students and Dependent Students. The bill proposes substantial improvements in the way financial need is established for disadvantaged independent students who do not have dependents other than a spouse. The bill increases the living offset (the amount of income allotted for the student's living expenses) for single students (and married students if both are enrolled in college) from $3,000 to $6,000, and $9,000 for married students where one is enrolled. The allowance is adjusted for inflation in future years. The bill also increases the dependent student earning allowance from the current level of $1,750 to $4,200. The current earning allowance is too low and is a disincentive to student employment. The change helps a category of low income students who were adversely affected by the 1992 higher education reauthorization. Protects Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The bill extends the date (to October 1, 2002) that HBCU's with high default rates are exempted from disqualification in student loan programs. Without the exception, the Department's default prevention policies will have an adverse effect upon 4 year colleges and universities which serve large percentages of minority students. Reduces Interest Rates for Unsubsidized Loans. The bill reduces the applicable interest rate on all subsidized and unsubsidized FFEL and Direct Loans during in-school, grace, and deferment periods to the same rate as the Department of Education's own borrowing rate, although the interest rates would be capped at the same levels as current law. The change will reduce Federal costs by reducing excess profits to lenders during times when there are few servicing costs associated with subsidized loans, but the highest profit margins. Guaranty Agencies and Lenders. The bill proposes a number of changes to the FFEL guaranty agency system in recognition that these State and private nonprofit entities are not the ultimate guarantors of FFEL and act only as administrative agents of the Federal government. Because the Federal government is the sole insurer of FFEL loans, the Secretary would undertake the obligation to pay lenders directly using his agents and recall guaranty agency reserves over the next five years, saving some $2.5 billion. To address structural deficiencies that hamper default prevention activities, guaranty agencies would be authorized to retain no more than 18.5 percent of default collections-- comparable to the Department's cost of collections. To further encourage default prevention, lender risk-sharing would be increased from 2 percent to 5 percent. Direct Lending and FFEL Loan Provisions. The bill allows FFEL borrowers to have the same extended and graduated repayment options currently available only to Direct Loan borrowers. The bill also makes a number of changes that make FFEL consolidation loans more comparable to Direct consolidation loans, thus reducing cost for, and providing greater flexibility to, FFEL borrowers.,2015-03-17 19:09:28.105525,2015-03-17 19:09:28.105525,Extensions,INTRODUCTION OF TWO MAJOR EDUCATION BILLS,1997-04-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-24/html/CREC-1997-04-24-pt1-PgE755-2.htm,50,0,143,E755-E757,C000488,mr. clay
2256,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in honoring the 10th anniversary of Missouri River Relief and their dedication to preserving Missouri rivers.As a lifelong Missourian, I have visited and enjoyed the natural beauty and recreational opportunities along the Missouri River. These riverbanks and waterways are treasured attractions throughout Missouri. The Missouri River enjoys over 1 million visitors from across the Nation each year who have the opportunity to experience the splendor and excitement these natural resources provide for our state. That is why I am so thrilled to acknowledge the work of the Missouri River Relief program.Founded in 2001, Missouri River Relief began with just a few Missouri River enthusiasts dedicated to cleaning up our State waters. Ten years later, 12,000 Missourians have joined their communities in fighting for this cause, removing over 1 million pounds of trash and debris, making our waters safer for all to enjoy. In 2010 alone, over 1,100 student and teacher volunteers helped clean over 70 miles of river.Missouri River Relief has contributed to promoting river education throughout the State. By sponsoring recreational activities and festivals that incorporate the arts alongside river education, this organization has made it their mission to teach Missouri families about our local rivers and how the rivers contribute to our environment.This project has received an outpouring of State and corporate sponsorships that have made this growing cause a reality. Neighboring States have also included their support, cleaning up almost 400 miles of the Missouri River. The trash gathered from these clean ups have included recyclable and environmental friendly particles that have been turned into useful resources.Working to preserve one of our country's most affluent and beautiful rivers, this organization deserves our gratitude and commemoration. Missouri River Relief is committed to water safety and education and its service to the community stands as an inspiration to all Missourians and a strong signal of our State's continued growth and success.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the 10th anniversary of the Missouri River Relief. ,2015-03-17 19:09:28.250628,2015-03-17 19:09:28.250628,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2011-02-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-02-03/html/CREC-2011-02-03-pt1-PgS541.htm,16,0,157,S541,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2257,MO,Todd,Akin,R,You know, it was interesting to me that there was a country--it was the U.S.--and they had a theory. Their theory was that the government should provide you with a job, with an education. They should provide you with health care. They should provide you with food and with clothing and with a place to live. That was the job of the government to do those things. We watched that country. It was a big country. After a while, it collapsed. It wasn't just the U.S.--It was the USSR.Aside from the fact that they just hated people of the Christian faith, aside from that sort of prejudice, that was their operating philosophy--that the government was going to provide things that were necessary for your survival. You've got to have food to survive, so the government is going to give it to you. You've got to have health care, so the government is going to give it to you. You have to have education, so the government is going to give it to you. That was their operating premise. We sat there, as I was a young man, and we went ``yuk, yuk, yuk'' when the whole thing fell apart, because we knew it was a dumb idea.So what are we doing in America here under the Pelosi and Obama leadership? The government is not only providing education and housing, but now they're going to jump into expanding to take over all of health care, and they are going to tell you where to work.I guess my question is: How come we are doing the same thing we knew that wouldn't work before? I think that's what a lot of American citizens are saying. Time out. What is going on? We need not just to get the budget in control. We need to deconstruct Washington, D.C., and we need to remove them as a threat to the freedom of this country.,2015-03-17 19:09:28.397726,2015-03-17 19:09:28.397726,House,HEALTH CARE,2010-02-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-24/html/CREC-2010-02-24-pt1-PgH823.htm,24,39,156,H823-H831,A000358,mr. akin
2258,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I stand today on behalf of my constituents and with my friend and colleague Congressman John Shimkus to raise further concern about the pending sale and format change of Classic99. As St. Louis's only classical radio station, Classic99 is a true asset to our city.As Congressman Shimkus noted, the sale of KFUO 99.1 FM by the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod is currently under review by both the Media Bureau and the FCC. While we certainly do not wish to exact undue influence on either of these agencies, our constituents have made clear to us their concerns, and we agree that this loss will be a blow to the wealth of our region's culture and economy. We hope that these negative impacts will be considered while reviewing this sale.We have seen that losing the arts can wreak havoc on a community, and the Metro East region will be no different. If Classic99 is converted to a different music format, the cultural and economic consequences will be dismal. The world-renowned St. Louis Symphony Orchestra will lose airtime and its chief advertising venue, forcing gifted musicians and staff to suffer even more pay cuts and freezes. Losing Classic99 will result in a cultural deficit as well. 94% of readers polled by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch feel that the loss of Classic99 ``takes away a vital voice for the arts in this community,'' and will detrimentally affect their ability to support local artists.Arts education organizations throughout my district, like the Opera Theater of St. Louis, the St. Louis Art Museum, and the Touhill Performing Arts Center, will lose their only major arena for audience-building, live broadcasts, and fund-raising. The loss of revenue will hinder arts and music education in the district, further impairing opportunities for our young people to be enriched through the arts. We know that arts education gives youths self-confidence and increases academic achievement. We simply cannot afford to sacrifice these opportunities, and I am deeply troubled by the idea that more educational outlets for our children will be put in jeopardy by this move.I firmly agree with my colleague that the negative impact these cultural and economic changes will have on the local community should play a role in determining the sale of 99.1. ,2015-03-17 19:09:28.551836,2015-03-17 19:09:28.551836,Extensions,IN SUPPORT OF KFUO 99.1 FM ``CLASSIC99'',2010-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-25/html/CREC-2010-02-25-pt1-PgE247-4.htm,25,0,156,E247-E248,C001049,mr. clay
2259,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Madam Speaker, today, along with my good friend Congressman Jim McGovern, I introduced a resolution of support for the goals and ideals of Global Child Nutrition Month. The fact that hunger and malnutrition is experienced by any person is a sad reflection on our society. However, it is even more troubling to know that roughly 300,000,000 children are experiencing hunger around the world. There is no greater investment in our security and global economic development then ensuring hungry children have access to nutritious food. A hungry child, suffering from malnutrition, will not reach their full physical or mental potential. A hungry child rarely attends school, leaving another, larger generation of hungry and uneducated men to be recruited into radical militant groups and uneducated women to be oppressed. We have the tools today to fight hunger and malnutrition in the world's youngest and most vulnerable. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program has proven to be a very effective tool for providing hungry children nutritious food. The program has the added benefit of encouraging parents to send their children to school, and not to rely on them for income or food. I also believe the political will to make the fight successful is increasing. Although we have a long way to go, President Obama's Administration is making visible efforts to add resources to fighting global hunger. Two examples include the increased budget for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program and the leadership being displayed by the Administration's Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative. Internationally the attention to global food security has rarely been more focused; and hopefully, the resources will soon follow the pledges. This April, many of our non-governmental organization partners will recognize Global Child Nutrition Month and the hunger facing children around the globe. I would like to particularly thank the Global Child Nutrition Foundation and School Nutrition Association for their work in increasing awareness of the problem global hunger presents and for raising funds to help feed hungry children. These two organizations partner with school nutrition professionals around the country and encourage them to take a day, week or even longer to work with students and teachers educating them and raising donations. It is grassroots education and fundraising at its best. Ensuring every child around the world has access to sufficient nutrition is a challenge that will not be easily met, but it will be met. With dedicated partners both in and out of government, we will achieve this goal quicker, which is why I am happy to introduce this resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Global Child Nutrition Month.,2015-03-17 19:09:28.810051,2015-03-17 19:09:28.810051,Extensions,SUPPORT THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF GLOBAL CHILD NUTRITION MONTH,2010-03-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-03-19/html/CREC-2010-03-19-pt1-PgE417-5.htm,41,0,156,E417,E000172,mrs. emerson
2260,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, from April 24-26, 2010 more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington, D.C. to take part in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals. We the People is the most extensive educational program in the country that educates young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education under the Education for Democracy Act approved by the United States Congress.I am proud to announce that a class from Westminster Christian Academy represented the state of Missouri at this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and captured ninth place at the national level.While in Washington, the students participated in a three-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which students demonstrate their knowledge and skills as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on historical and contemporary constitutional issues. Annual surveys consistently show that high school students who take part in the We the People academic competition outperform national samples of high school students participating in the National Assessment of Educational Progress political test by at least 22 percent.Madam Speaker, the names of these outstanding students from Westminster Christian Academy are:Molly Anderson, Nick Arnold, Olivia Atkinson, Cheyenne Bartlett, Daniel Chae, Jacob Dahl, Kevin Goldfarb, Jake Grimes, Grace Johnson, Sarah Johnson, Alex Lindstrom, Jimmy Myers, Andrew Nichols, David Rasche, Matt Schwartz, Michael Scott, Ashley Segrave, Emily Sherman, and Curtis Stump.I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Ken Boesch, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the National Finals. Also worthy of special recognition are Millie Aulbur, the state coordinator, and Sandra Diamond, the district coordinator who are responsible for implementing the We the People program in my district.I congratulate these young ``constitutional experts'' on their outstanding achievement at the We the People national finals.,2015-03-17 19:09:29.072211,2015-03-17 19:09:29.072211,Extensions,HONORING WESTMINSTER CHRISTIAN ACADEMY 2010 WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALS,2010-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-05-20/html/CREC-2010-05-20-pt1-PgE896-3.htm,77,0,156,E896,C001049,mr. clay
2261,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Madam Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Rev. William Bellais, Ed.D., and his wife, Ann Bellais, of Chillicothe, Missouri. Bill and Ann are very dedicated individuals who exemplify the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership. I thank Grace Episcopal Church for hosting a retirement reception in their honor on Sunday, July 12, Bill has an impressive list of degrees, ranging from theological studies to history to counseling psychology. He received his Doctor of Education degree in higher education management and education psychology in 1988 from New Mexico State University.Bill's dedication to his community and his country has been exceptional. He served three years in the U.S. Marine Corps, including service in Korea, as well as 17 years in the Army as an intelligence specialist, including two years of service in Vietnam, receiving over a dozen awards along the way. He has been the Rector at Grace Episcopal Church in Chillicothe since 1992, as well as an active member of the Diocese of West Missouri. Bill is the Chaplain for the Home Health and Hospice Department at Hedrick Medical Center in Chillicothe, and he also serves as an adjunct faculty staff member for several colleges. Bill is also active in countless community activities, serving on the Board of Directors for organizations such as Hope Haven Industries, the North Central Missouri Rural Housing Coalition, Chillicothe Area Habitat for Humanity, the Chillicothe Rotary Club, and many more.Ann Bellais has been just as active in the community as her husband. She has been a strong leader in the Missouri State Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution for years, having been an active member of DAR for an incredible 49 years. She has served as President for both the Chillicothe Church Women United group and the Chillicothe Garden Club. She has also served on the board of Hope Haven Industries, and she has represented the area for two hospitals in Kansas City--serving St. Luke's Hospital on a Spiritual Wellness Committee, and Children's Mercy Hospital on a regional council.Madam Speaker, I proudly ask my colleagues to join me in commending Bill and Ann Bellais for their dedicated service to the community of Chillicothe, Missouri.

2262,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I would like to jump in a little bit about this whole idea about our trust for different bureaucracies.Let us take a look at the track record. We're talking about a health care system that's going to have the good heart of the IRS and the efficiency of the postal system. Let us take a look at some of these different government agencies and how much--do we really want to trust them with our personal health care? Let's think a little bit about the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy was chartered with a mission. The mission was that we were going to make sure that we're not dependent on foreign sources of energy.Now, we have had a lot of employees and we're more dependent on foreign energy than we've ever been. So how good is the Department of Energy?Let's talk about the Department of Education. There was a Presidential commission studying the Department of Education. They came to the conclusion that if a foreign country had done to us what the Department of Education has done, we would consider it an act of war. But we have a lot of faith in government bureaucracies.Let's talk about your favorite bureaucracy. I shouldn't pick on your pet, the CIA. We go into gulf war 1 and they give us this intelligence. They say, Look, Iraq is 10 years away from making a nuclear device. We get in there; they're a year-and-a-half away. So they go to gulf war II. They say they're a year-and-a-half away. We get in there, they're 10 years away. I mean, why do we have so much faith in all of these?I guess FEMA did a wonderful job on Hurricane Katrina, and yet we want to turn our personal health care over to all of these government agencies? I don't get it. It doesn't seem to make any sense at all.,2015-03-17 19:09:29.372425,2015-03-17 19:09:29.372425,House,NATIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN,2009-07-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-07-22/html/CREC-2009-07-22-pt1-PgH8576.htm,111,89,155,H8576-H8584,A000358,mr. akin
2263,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, let me take this moment to recognize the Lafayette-Lexington Daughters of the American Revolution Chapter for creating the Susan Skelton Memorial Scholarship. The scholarship was created in memory of my late wife Susan Anding Skelton, honoring her dedication to higher education and Lafayette County.Susie, a native Missourian, graduated with a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Missouri, Columbia in 1958. In 1976, she served as the first president of the 95th Congress group, the organization representing spouses of new Members of Congress. Susie also played a prominent role in the Congressional Club, serving as treasurer for 2 years and then as president. She was only the second Missourian to serve in that position. As president, she presided over one of the largest memberships in the history of the organization. Additionally, she was president and vice president of International Club III, an organization for spouses of Members of Congress and Ambassadors and was a member of the Congressional Families for Drug-Free Youth.In Missouri, Susie served two consecutive terms as Regent of the Lafayette-Lexington Chapter D.A.R. She also served 4 years on the Democratic State Committee during the 1970s. In Lexington, she taught Sunday school, was a Cub Scout den mother, and a local first grade teacher. Susie was also active in Missouri University Alumni Association events in Lafayette County.Our family friend, LaVeda Cross, was aware of Susie's great involvement in both Washington, DC, and Missouri. As a result, LaVeda and the Lafayette-Lexington D.A.R. Chapter have offered a collegiate scholarship to those individuals that embody the values of Susie. I appreciate the D.A.R. chapter for recognizing the achievements and contributions of Susie. The scholarship is open to any female student who is a permanent resident of Lafayette County and a graduate of one of the following schools: Concordia R-H, Lafayette County C-1, Lexington R-V, St. Paul's Lutheran, or Wellington-Napoleon R-IX and plans to attend college after graduation.Madam Speaker, Susie was influential in Lafayette County and Washington, DC.

2264,MO,Todd,Akin,R,The thing that scares me to death is my first experience as a State legislator was trying to get a left-turn signal put into a traffic light. Now, there was a lane marked in the pavement. They had a left arrow, but they didn't have a light that had a left arrow. That took me about 4 years and probably over 150 phone calls to the highway department to get them to put that little lens in there with a light that says left turn.I am thinking, if I have trouble with that, how in the world are we going to make something like this work. This is just bizarre. Then I start to think who in the world would have the faith to want to put this system together. Let's take a look at how well our current different departments are doing.You have the post office department known for its efficiency.Then you have an energy department. It was created with the purpose of making sure that we weren't dependent on foreign oil. Oh, that is helpful to know that.Then you have the people who took care of Hurricane Katrina and our emergency management services there.Then you have the education department. They set some records, too, because a study was done of the U.S. Education Department and the conclusion was, if a foreign power had done to America what the Department of Education had done, it would be considered an act of war.Then you have the CIA. Now, there is an interesting operation. In Gulf War I they tell us, well, Iraq is probably 10 years away from making a bomb. We get in there, they are 1 year away. Gulf War II they say they are 1 year away from making a bomb. We get in there and they are not doing it at all.So we have all of these agencies with a great track record, and now we are saying, yeah, so let's turn our health over to the Federal Government.

Doak was born on December 24, 1922, and was the second of seven children to the late Grace and Edgar Doak. Upon completion of high school, Richard became a student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. His college education was interrupted to volunteer for service in the United States Army in World War II. On August 19, 1944, he married Virginia Ray McClesky and soon after completed his undergraduate education, receiving a B.S. in Agriculture. He again served his country as an infantry platoon leader, 7th Division, 31st (Polar Bear) Regiment, Charlie Company, during the Korean War. In honor of his commitment to the U.S. Army, he was awarded both the Silver Star for gallantry in combat and the Bronze Star for meritorious service. After his service, the Doaks returned to Missouri where they would raise their four children on the family farm. Mr. Doak later earned a master's degree in Education from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and served as a teacher at Payne School and as an elementary school principal at Hallsville, Jefferson City, and Versailles, MO. In 1985, Richard retired from teaching and returned to work on his farm raising and showing Southdown sheep.Virginia Ray (McClesky) Doak was born on December 8, 1922, in King, Texas, to Estelle and Henry McClesky. Virginia graduated from high school in Gatesville and attended the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. After receiving her degree, Virginia taught school at Purmela and Plainview in Texas and Payne School in Missouri. On August 19, 1944, she married Richard Doak, a Missourian she had met while he was stationed at Fort Hood.

2267,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chairman, we are speaking about today and not 1983.I have had the opportunity, since being a Member of Congress, to work in the area of professional military education. I must tell you it's important not just for American students, American leaders, American service personnel, but it's important for our friends and allies as well.I have nothing but great respect, great respect for my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts. I know how strongly he feels in his beliefs. But I must say that we are doing the right thing by keeping this school going and going well.We do not teach human rights abuse. This school bestows upon its students standards. It teaches them military art. It teaches them military-to-military relationships. It also instructs in the area of human rights.I have been to Latin America several times. Three weeks ago, I travelled again to the region with Dr. Gingrey and Mr. Conaway, visited Colombia and Panama. There we met with President Uribe of Colombia, President Torrijos of Panama, and other senior military and political leaders. Without exception, the leaders of those countries touted the WHINSEC program in Georgia as an exceptional opportunity for their men and women in uniform to gain not only technical knowledge but a deeper understanding of human rights.Furthermore, spending time in the United States gives them an opportunity to learn of American values, gives them the opportunity to make friends within the American military, with whom they will undoubtedly, in days and years ahead, will have the opportunity to work.I spoke with our American commanders in the field. They reiterated what I have heard many times before. Individuals who have been trained at WHINSEC performed better on their missions in their host country than those who have not.Our military commanders also cherished the relationships that they have built with their Latin American counterparts who participated in the program.In addition to comprehending our military culture and its operations, the school of graduates often are promoted and rapidly rise through the ranks. They understand what it is to have American values, and they understand about human rights which are taught there. The message from everyone was simple: Please keep that school open.Professional military education is so important, but it's also extremely important to allow our neighbors, our friends to the south.

Additionally, the band has been acknowledged for many outstanding achievements including 2nd place in the class 1A parade at Carollton Band Day in 2001, 1st place in the class 1A parade at CMC Band Day in 2001, 1st place in class 1A at the Northwest Missouri State University Homecoming Flag Corps in 2002, the color guard competition in 2001, 1st place in the class 1A parade at the Missouri Day Parade in 2002, 1st place in the class 1A Parade at Central Missouri State University Homecoming in 2002, 2nd place in the class 1A parade at Northwest Missouri State University homecoming in 2002, and 1st place in the Chillicothe Christmas Parade in 2002.Many students have dedicated their time and effort to making the band the accomplished organization that it is. I commend the time and dedication these students have put forth being a part of this wonderful after school activity while also working hard at their studies. Marisa Fultz, Drum Major and Field Commander and Brenna Hicks, Assistant Drum Major have worked very hard to ensure that the band performs at it's best.Additionally, the band has received a great deal of support from the education community, including the Board of Education, Mrs. Marla Barnes, President of the Board of Education, Mr. Gerald Snodgrass, Superintendent, Mr. Robert Newhart, Polo High School Principal, Ms. Beverly McQueen, Elementary School Principal, and the band boosters led by president Darrin Hicks.Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending the Polo High School Marching Panther Pride Band. The band is a primary example of educational excellence in North Missouri and in their community. I wish them the best of luck at the Gator Bowl!,2015-03-17 19:09:30.630313,2015-03-17 19:09:30.630313,Extensions,HONORING THE POLO HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING PANTHER PRIDE BAND,2003-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-05-09/html/CREC-2003-05-09-pt1-PgE893-2.htm,69,0,149,E893,G000546,mr. graves
2270,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory and tribute to Dr. M. Graham Clark who called the School of the Ozarks his home for the past six decades. Dr. Clark passed away on March 15, at age 92 at his residence on the campus.Dr. Clark led a life dedicated to the glory of God, and committed to the principles of hard work and educational excellence as he worked to expand and lead a free faith-based education to literally thousands of students who have attend the school in the Missouri Ozarks.Dr. Clark arrived at the School of the Ozarks in 1946. Under his leadership the high school was transformed first to a junior college and later into a four year institution of higher learning that is nationally recognized for its emphasis on character development, academic excellence and student work. Those who attend the School of the Ozarks--now named the College of the Ozarks--are offered a unique opportunity. In exchange for a world class college degree, students work for their tuition. They work daily as the college's maintenance, janitorial, secretarial and grounds keeping staff, security guards and food service personnel. This concept, which has won the school an international reputation as ``Hard Work U'', opened the doors of higher education to many who would never have dreamed they could achieve a college degree.Dr. Clark was a tireless campaigner and promoter for the College of the Ozarks in persuading donors to support the school located at Point Lookout, Missouri. His determination and leadership transformed the School of the Ozarks into a national model that has drawn students from all over the world for a classic education steeped in faith, work and service. College of the Ozarks is a unique blend of old fashion respect, daily application of the ``Golden Rule'', and modern technology mixed together with a strong emphasis on the work ethic.The legacy of Dr. M. Graham Clark will touch the lives of many people for generations to come because of the institution he nurtured and guided. Through the School of the Ozarks, he shaped the lives and faith of countless scholars, business people, government officials and ministers across America who continue to mold and shape the lives of the people in their own communities.Dr. Clark was known for his strength of character, great wisdom and insight. His legacy of leadership is reflected in the lives of thousands and is shared by Dr. Jerry Davis as he and the College of the Ozarks continue in the business of changing lives.,2015-03-17 19:09:30.761413,2015-03-17 19:09:30.761413,Extensions,A VISIONARY MISSOURI EDUCATOR,2001-03-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-22/html/CREC-2001-03-22-pt1-PgE437-3.htm,39,0,147,E437,B000575,mr. blunt
2271,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.I want to thank Chairman Combest and Ranking Member Stenholm for working endlessly on the Farm Security Act of 2001. I want them to know that I think they have done a superb job. I think it is an excellent bill. The producers in my district think it is an excellent bill, in spite of what some other people might say. I sincerely appreciate their efforts to include the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the trade title of the farm bill.Missouri's own Harry Truman joined 20,000 Americans on May the 8th, 1946, in sending food donations to victims and survivors of World War II. Many of these recipients were children. And when the packages reached the port at LeHavre, France, it was clear that the folks in the U.S. had joined forces to help those in need, something that Americans have always done at home and abroad.We are fortunate to have overcome the scars of starvation experienced in World War II here in this country, but the battle against hunger and for survival still exists today. We know the school lunch program here in America has made a genuine difference in the lives of hungry children; but, unfortunately, children in other countries are still starving. Three hundred million poor children are undernourished, and 35,000 children die every day from hunger-related disease and illness. A hungry child cannot learn.I am very, very proud of the bill that my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), and I introduced, the George McGovern and Bob Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Act of 2001, which is loosely based on our American School Lunch Program, which was originally sponsored in the United States Senate by Senator Dole and Senator McGovern, who are known worldwide for being champions of ending hunger.Now, the Food for Education Act would make permanent a pilot program for commodity donations that was established during the 106th Congress. This is truly a win-win endeavor for the United States. Not only are we able to feed children here at home and in poor countries, but we also use surpluses from our farmers and producers, and that helps strengthen their bottom lines at a time when our farmers are truly hurting.Additionally, it strengthens farm prices, and we all know that aid does lead to trade.So I just want to thank the chairman and the ranking member once again for including this very, very important piece of legislation within the bill.,2015-03-17 19:09:30.887501,2015-03-17 19:09:30.887501,House,FARM SECURITY ACT OF 2001,2001-10-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-10-04/html/CREC-2001-10-04-pt1-PgH6266-2.htm,132,19,147,H6266-H6342,E000172,mrs. emerson
2272,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Republican Majority's socially and fiscally irresponsible budget resolution for fiscal year 2001. I strongly support the Democratic substitute, and urge Members to do the same.This bill is socially irresponsible because it cuts non-defense discretionary spending $114 billion below inflation over the next five years. It does so in order to fund a fiscally irresponsible tax cut that could balloon to as much as $200 billion in five years, and over $1 trillion in ten years. This bill hurts the most needy Americans whom the Republican Party has traditionally ignored. It benefits the most wealthy, as well as the Republicans' special interest friends.Let's take a close look.Under the Majority's bill funding for critical education, training, employment, and social service programs is either frozen or cut, producing significant reductions in current service levels. Only special education is spared the sledgehammer. For example, by fiscal year 2005, 40,000 fewer children would be able to participate in Head Start; and 164,000 fewer low-income families would be able to receive LIHEAP assistance. In just one year, 316,000 fewer low-income students would be able to receive Pell Grants; and 310,000 fewer low-income women, infants, and children would be able to participate in the WIC program.The bill would also slash Title I funding, forcing school districts to provide services to a smaller number of low-income students. The Clinton/Clay class size reduction initiative would be cut, leaving school districts with fewer resources to hire and train new teachers. After-school and summer programs established to help improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime would be cut back, undermining vital school reform efforts.Clearly, this budget abandons those most in need of Federal support. It also fails to address important national priorities such as securing Social Security and Medicare, and paying down the debt. None of this is necessary. The Democratic substitute shows why. Our substitute cuts taxes, but does so in a manner that targets the benefits to working families. Our substitute provides sufficient resources to invest in education and develop our communities. Our substitute would make Social Security and Medicare strong and solvent, while reducing the debt and preserving the hard-won budget surplus.Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I urge the rejection of the Republican Majority's budget resolution, and urge the adoption of the Democratic substitute.,2015-03-17 19:09:31.043613,2015-03-17 19:09:31.043613,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-23/html/CREC-2000-03-23-pt1-PgH1291-2.htm,34,207,146,H1291-H1326,C000488,mr. clay
2273,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, this conference report is essentially the same document as the resolution Republicans had on the floor last month. The Republican budget plan, if implemented, would threaten our record prosperity and undermine the values of middle-class families. This budget reflects the irresistible urge Republicans have to enact massive, irresponsible tax cuts above all other needs and priorities of the American people.They give tax cuts a higher priority than extending the life of Social Security and Medicare, they are willing to sacrifice a real Medicare prescription drug plan for all seniors, and they are willing to make deep cuts in health and education in order to make their budget add up.There is not one dime in this budget for Social Security and Medicare. Republicans' unwillingness to do anything to prevent the long-term insolvency of these programs that serve as the bedrock of retirement security for millions of Americans is inexplicable.This budget pretends that it pays for a prescription drug plan. But, if you look closer, you will see there is not one penny appropriated for a drug plan. The money is ``reserved.'' It is a budget gimmick. It is not real. It will not happen. Talk is cheap; prescription drugs are not. This budget does not solve the problem.This budget contains Draconian cuts in non-defense appropriations. Nearly $120 billion in cuts need to be made, and, if Republicans have their way, they will cut deep into important priorities like education, health, veterans' affairs, and the environment.It is clear what the American people want. They want a fiscally responsible budget that will keep interest rates low and the economy growing, they want to strengthen Social Security and Medicare so that retirement security is protected for current and future retirees, they want a drug plan in Medicare that covers all seniors who want it, and they want to invest the surplus in their priorities, like making sure that children get the best public education we can provide.Mr. Speaker, this budget did not get better in the conference. It probably got worse. It continues to ignore the voices of working families who have made it perfectly clear that they reject the efforts to bleed the surplus dry for political tax cuts instead of investing in Social Security, in Medicare, in paying down the debt, in ensuring the future of this great country.Vote against this budget. We can do better than this.,2015-03-17 19:09:31.266773,2015-03-17 19:09:31.266773,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 290, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-04-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-04-13/html/CREC-2000-04-13-pt1-PgH2242-5.htm,47,41,146,H2242-H2258,G000132,mr. gephardt
2274,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my congratulations to Second Lieutenant Kevin R. White on the occasion of his graduation from Officers Training School. This is a considerable achievement, which I am proud to command to the attention of Congress.Lieutenant White is no stranger to hard work and high achievements. Before graduating from Officers Training School, as an enlisted man he worked toward no less than four different degrees. First he attended and graduated from Georgia Military College in 1989. He then went on to attend the Community College of the Air Force, where he received a degree in Metals Technology in 1991. After that he continued his education by graduating in 1996 from Wayland Baptist University with a B.S. in Occupations Education and graduating from La Verne University in 1999 with a Masters degree in Organizational Management.Throughout his career in the military and in academia, Lieutenant White received a number of awards and honors. He was awarded two Air Force Commendation Medals and one Air Force Achievement Medal. Lieutenant White was named the Third Equipment Maintenance Squadron, Noncommissioned Officer of the Year in 1997 and the Third Equipment Maintenance Squadron Noncommissioned Officer of the 4th quarter in 1997. While fulfilling his military duties, Lieutenant White also excelled in his studies, making the President's list at Wayland Baptist University in 1996.In addition to excelling in the Air Force and working toward a top notch education, Lieutenant White was busy fulfilling many military assignments overseas, such as completing a remote tour of Keflavik, Iceland from 1991 to 1992. Additionally, he spent over 9 years overseas in different countries, including Thailand, Iceland, Singapore, Japan, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant White also found time amidst his many responsibilities to volunteer to be a Big Brother while in Alaska. In fact, he received the Big Brother, Big Sister of the Year Award in 1997. Currently, Lieutenant White takes time out of his busy schedule to coach bowling for participants in the Special Olympics.Lieutenant White has served his community and his country with great distinction.

2275,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, if the President were awake at this time of night and watching these proceedings, I am sure that he would say that while he is pleased that this important measure is moving forward, he is also disappointed that we have yet to tackle even more critical priorities in education. This Congress has failed to take action on reducing class sizes. This Congress has failed to take action to address crumbling and overcrowded schools. This Congress has failed to take action on revitalizing our public schools. If this Congress fails to take action on these critical education priorities, we are shortchanging America's schoolchildren. I am sure that would be the response that our President would make.This bill, the William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998, before the House is the product of bipartisan work and an excellent example of what can be accomplished when we join forces to address problems facing our Nation's youth. This important legislation firmly places our child nutrition programs on the path to serve the needs of America's children in the 21st century.H.R. 3874 expands and improves the focus of child nutrition programs in numerous ways. First, it ensures that the Summer Food Service Program will reach more needy children with more nutritious meals. Second, the bill adds provisions to guard against fraud in the WIC program. In addition, it establishes a universal school breakfast pilot project which will examine the close link between education and nutrition.Finally, Mr. Speaker, and most importantly, this legislation enables institutions providing afterschool care to receive reimbursement for meal supplements served to children under the age of 18. This supplement is one more incentive for parents and children to participate in productive, afterschool programs.In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my thanks for the hard work of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and the ranking subcommittee member the gentleman from California (Mr. Martinez) for crafting this legislation. I especially want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) who spearheaded much of the reauthorization on our committee. Her work has been invaluable and many of the bill's provisions are based on legislative proposals that she championed.Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a positive step forward.

2276,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, as our Nation's youth head back to school, our attention is obviously focused on education. I would like to focus the national spotlight on one university in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District.Mr. Speaker, I have the distinct honor of representing 16 colleges and universities. Each of these institutions of higher learning in central and northeastern Missouri deserves accolades. Tonight, however, I am happy to single out and congratulate one of those exceptional universities, Truman State, nestled in the heart of Kirksville, MO. Truman State University has received numerous awards in recent college rankings. According to the September 1 issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report, Truman State is the top public university in the entire Midwest. In addition, Mr. Speaker, for the fifth consecutive year, Truman State University is ranked among Money magazine's top 10 best college buys in the country. Frank Lalli, the managing editor for Money magazine says, ``There is always this myth in America that only a name college, only a Harvard, only a Yale provides a great education. It's just not true.''Ranking 8th in the entire Nation, Truman State University consistently reaffirms its reputation as an excellent and affordable liberal arts university. Truman is the only Missouri public institution to make Money's top 100 list. Truman also was ranked as the best value in the Midwest. Money magazine based its selection on graduation rates, social climates, as well as student accessibility to professors. With a student-faculty ratio of 16 to 1, Truman State students can develop close relationships with their professors.I have had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to meet many students and professors who personally validate these recent rankings. John Burns, a Truman State junior, joined my Washington, DC, staff for part of the summer and did exceptional work. But perhaps no one exemplifies the spirit of this great institution better than my good friend, Jack Magruder. As President, Dr. Magruder is a tireless ambassador for Truman State. When looking for someone responsible for Truman State University's ascendance to the top of the Nation's colleges, the buck stops at Jack's door.Mr. Speaker, we in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District are extremely proud that one of our institutions of higher learning is considered among the Nation's elite. The administration, the faculty and the student body at Truman State University deserve kudos for their hard work, their dedication to excellence and their commitment to a superior liberal arts education.,2015-03-17 19:09:31.699079,2015-03-17 19:09:31.699079,House,SPOTLIGHT ON TRUMAN STATE UNIVERSITY,1997-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-04/html/CREC-1997-09-04-pt1-PgH6903-3.htm,115,1,143,H6903,H000948,mr. hulshof

2279,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to Dr. Ed Elliott, who is retiring from his post as President of Central Missouri State University (CMSU), Warrensburg, MO, after serving there for nearly fourteen years.During Dr. Elliott's tenure at CMSU, the University has seen tremendous growth in enrollment due to Ed's insightful university policies. There has been an expansion of the school's international and distance learning programs, increased admissions standards, a new general studies program, an emphasis in strategic planning and collegial governance, and an integration of a new teaching-learning-assessment model known as Continuous Process Improvement. In addition, numerous building renovations and new construction projects, including the James C. Kirkpatrick Library that will be dedicated in March, have added to student interest in CMSU.Under Ed's leadership, the University has received dramatically increased state and alumni funding. He has also set academic priorities to develop all curriculum around a strong, liberal arts core, verifying quality through assessment and program-specific accreditation. In addition, he integrated technology into the curriculum and emphasized teacher education. Recently, Central has been named the state's lead institution in professional technology.Dr. Elliott became Central Missouri State's 12th president on July 1, 1985, after serving for three years as president of Wayne State College in Wayne, NE. He came to Wayne State in 1971 as director of graduate studies and had also served as a dean and vice president before being named president there.A native of Grain Valley, MO, Ed is a 1960 graduate of William Jewell College and started his teaching career in Harrisonville that same year. He earned his master's degree from Columbia University in 1964, and his doctor of education degree from the University of Northern Colorado in 1969.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Ed Elliott has had an outstanding career in education, and he will surely be missed by everyone at Central Missouri State University.

2280,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the welfare-to-work provisions only that are included in H.R. 3073, the Fathers Count Act. These provisions broaden the eligibility requirements for the program so that tens of thousands of low-income families will receive job search and training assistance to improve their ability to secure gainful employment.The welfare-to-work program was enacted as part of the 1997 budget agreement to help families transition from welfare to work by providing them meaningful education and job training assistance. Forty-seven States currently participate in the program and 76,000 recipients have received services.This bill contains a number of improvements necessary to ensure the program's future success. Most notably, Mr. Chairman, the bill expands current eligibility requirements which are so narrow in current law that many deserving welfare recipients cannot qualify. Both the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Ways and Means reported bills that would ease the rules so that more individuals can be assisted.Mr. Chairman, there are others issues that were not solved in committee. The substitute, in my opinion, should reauthorize the Welfare to Work program in future years. The 2.6 million individuals who remain on welfare is a hard-to-serve population that will require extensive and intensive assistance to successfully move off of welfare. This program will be needed for many more years to come.Also, H.R. 3073 only covers six months of education and job training assistance. This is far too short. I regret also that the Committee on Rules did not make in order the amendment of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) to extend training to one year. I support amendments to be offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) which would change the fatherhood program to the parenthood program. I share her concern that both parents need support and should be treated equally.Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments and to support the welfare-to-work operations of the bill.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ,2015-03-17 19:09:32.401572,2015-03-17 19:09:32.401572,House,FATHERS COUNT ACT OF 1999,1999-11-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-10/html/CREC-1999-11-10-pt1-PgH11870-3.htm,158,25,145,H11870-H11901,C000488,mr. clay
2281,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American--a nationally acclaimed civil rights attorney, public education advocate and a true champion of social justice . . . my dear friend and constituent, Frankie Muse Freeman.Frankie Freeman has been a practicing attorney in state and federal courts for more than 60 years. After graduating Hampton Institute and Howard University Law School, she began her career serving the state of Missouri and the City of St. Louis. During this time she helped the NAACP in the case of Brewton v. St. Louis Board of Education, and later represented the NAACP in the landmark case, Davis v. the St. Louis Housing Authority, which ended racial discrimination in public housing.In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Frankie Freeman as the first female member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.From 1967-1971, Frankie Muse Freeman served with distinction as the 14th National President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. During this turbulent time period, she used her talents and skills as an attorney to enhance the Sorority's efforts to gain full civil rights for African-Americans. She spoke out often and effectively for social action and ensured that the Sorority continued to lead efforts to secure human rights for all people. She also used her tenure as National President to lead the Sorority in supporting the college education of a record breaking number of African-American students.Last July, Ms. Freeman became the 96th recipient of the coveted Spingarn Medal, the highest honor bestowed on a citizen by the NAACP. In the official announcement issued by the NAACP Board of Directors Chairman Roslyn M. Brock, she noted, ``Frankie Muse Freeman has dedicated her life's work to the civil rights movement. She broke down barriers as a member of the NAACP's brain trust during the 1950s and as the first woman to serve on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Her determination to end racial discrimination in American society for more than half a century serves as an inspiration to us all.''Mr. Speaker, Frankie Freeman has been a personal mentor of mine for almost 30 years. Her inspired advocacy laid the groundwork for the Federal Voting Rights Act, ended racial discrimination in public housing, and provided dedicated oversight of the St. Louis Public Schools and the voluntary desegregation plan. She is truly a national treasure and is most deserving of congressional recognition. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring her remarkable service to the United States, the State of Missouri and the St. Louis community. ,2015-03-17 19:09:32.543680,2015-03-17 19:09:32.543680,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO FRANKIE MUSE FREEMAN, NATIONALLY-ACCLAIMED CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, PUBLIC EDUCATION ADVOCATE, SOCIAL JUSTICE CHAMPION,2012-01-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-01-31/html/CREC-2012-01-31-pt1-PgE97-3.htm,15,0,158,E97-E98,C001049,mr. clay
2282,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Dr. Dennis Fisher on his retirement as the Superintendent of the Park Hill School District in Kansas City, Missouri.Dr. Fisher started his career in education as a Junior High Social Studies teacher in Papillion, Nebraska. He also served as the interim Superintendent and the Assistant Superintendent for Business Services at the Liberty School District in Liberty, Missouri. He began his time at Park Hill in 1999 as the Assistant Superintendent for Business Services before becoming Superintendent in 2005. Dr. Fisher has a total of 36 years of experience in education.Under Dr. Fisher's leadership, the Park Hill School District has achieved many awards. They became the first school district ever to receive the Missouri Quality Award and continues to receive the Distinction in Performance Award from the State of Missouri each year. Park Hill is one of the highest-achieving districts in the state, but Dr. Fisher has still pushed for continuous improvement through the years.Dr. Fisher has received many acclamations personally also. In 2011, he was named the Missouri Superintendent of the Year and received the Pierce Award, the Missouri Association of School Administrators' highest honor. In 2005, Dr. Fisher received the Missouri School Business Official of the Year award.He leads not only 10,292 students, 1,400 staff members, and an annual operating budget of $120 million, but also many organizations of his peers. He has served as President of the Missouri Association of School Business Officials, the Kansas City Association of School Business Officials, and the Greater Kansas City Administrators Association. He is also very dedicated to helping the community and has served on the Board of Directors for the Missouri Securities Investment Program, Synergy Services Inc, the Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Platte County Economic Development Council, and the Parkville Economic Development Council.I have had the honor of working with Dr. Fisher over the last few years and have seen first hand his dedication to the education and development of students in the Park Hill School District.

2283,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Today, I and Senator Jim Talent introduce the Easement Owners Fair Compensation Act of 2006. This bill will right a wrong done to property owners from whom the government took property without compensation. It will also ensure that future property owners are treated fairly when the government seeks to take their property through eminent domain.In 1992, the federal government confiscated property owned by 102 St. Louis County, Missouri residents through the Federal Rails to Trails Act. The taking imposed an easement on their property for a public recreational hiking/biking trail. A trail easement was established on their property on December 20, 1992. After twelve years of bureaucratic fighting and delay, the Justice Department admitted the government's takings liability and agreed to pay the property owners $2,385,000.85 for their property, interest and legal fees.However, two days before the U.S. Court of Claims was scheduled to approve the compensation agreement, the U.S. Federal Circuit issued the Caldwell decision regarding a rails-to-trails takings case in Georgia. That decision established the statute of limitations for rails-to-trails claims as the date of notice of interim trail use, not the date the trail easement was imposed on the property, as previously assumed. Under the new date, the statute of limitations on the St. Louis County takings claim had expired. The Justice Department accordingly sought dismissal of the claims without payment and the Court of Claims judge agreed.This bill is a Senate companion to H.R. 4581 introduced by Representative Akin and cosponsored by Representatives Carnahan and Emerson. The legislation sets the statute of limitations as beginning on the date an interest is conveyed. It also allows for reconsideration of past claims dismissed because of this issue. By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Coleman):S. 3480. A bill to prevent abuse of Government credit cards; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Government Credit Card Abuse Prevention Act to address, in a comprehensive way, the abuse, misuse, and fraud that has occurred with Government charge cards. Some people might ask, ``Why are you bothering with legislation? Is it that big of a problem?'' It is true that most Government employees who are entrusted with a travel card or a purchase card do not abuse it. It may also be true that the amount of money concerned is only a fraction of any agency's annual budget. Well, when you have agencies like the Department of Defense with an over $500 billion budget, even a small fraction means a lot of taxpayers' money. When I asked GAO to look into instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with Government charge cards, starting with the Department of Defense, we found that purchase cards were used to spend taxpayer money for a sapphire ring, LA-Z-Boy reclining rocking chairs, and a dinner party for a general at Treasure Island Hotel and Casino that included $800 for alcohol. Government travel cards were used for gambling, sporting events, concerts, cruises, and even gentlemen's clubs and legalized brothels. Government travel cards are for official travel-related expenses only, not tickets to a Dallas Cowboys game or a Janet Jackson concert, but these are real examples of improper purchases GAO uncovered in reports I had requested. While travel cards are not paid directly with taxpayers' money like purchase cards, failure by employees to repay these cards results in the loss of millions of dollars in rebates to the Federal Government. Also, when credit card companies are forced to charge off bad debt, they raise interest rates and fees on everyone else.Based on what we found in DoD, I worked with GAO to uncover similar problems in the U.S. Forest Service where one employee purchased five digital cameras at a cost of $2,960, six computers for $6,019, three palm pilots totaling $736, jewelry worth $1,967, and $6,101 in other items like cordless telephones, figurines, and Sony Playstations, all for personal use and all at taxpayer expense. GAO subsequently found similar problems at other agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Housing an Urban Development. I have cited just some of the extreme examples, but there are many more instances where employees purchased items that were not needed by the agency or where a cheaper alternative would meet the purpose just as well. This occurred because of weak internal controls within the agencies and is something that clearly needs to be addressed governmentwide. Based on oversight from Congress, GAO, and agency inspectors general, the situation has improved in many agencies and I am pleased that the Office of Management and Budget has begun to bring about an improved control environment through direction contained in OMB Circular 123. However, there is more to be done and my experience has convinced me that legislation is necessary.The Government Credit Card Abuse Prevention Act is largely based on the recommendations by GAO regarding what controls are necessary to prevent the kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse we have uncovered. Since I originally introduced this legislation in the last Congress, I have collected input and ideas and worked to refine the bill to make it both comprehensive and workable. The provisions in my bill are simply commonsense internal controls that should be present in every Federal agency to prevent improper purchases. These include: performing credit checks for travel cardholders and issuing restricted cards for those with poor or no credit to reduce the potential for misuse; maintaining a record of each cardholder, including single transaction limits and total credit limits so agencies can effectively manage their cardholders; implementing periodic reviews to determine if cardholders have a need for a card; properly recording rebates to the Government based on prompt payment; providing training for cardholders and managers; utilizing available technologies to prevent or catch fraudulent purchases; establishing specific policies about the number of cards to be issued, the credit limits for certain categories of cardholders, and categories of employees eligible to be issued cards; invalidating cards when employees leave the agency or transfer; establishing an approving official other than the purchase cardholder so employees cannot approve their own purchases; reconciling purchase card charges on the bill with receipts and supporting documentation; submitting disputed purchase card charges to the bank according to the proper procedure; making purchase card payments promptly to avoid interest penalties; retaining records of purchase card transactions in accordance with standard Government recordkeeping polices; utilizing mandatory split disbursements when reimbursing employees for travel card purchases to ensure that travel card bills get paid; comparing items submitted on travel vouchers with items already paid for with centrally billed accounts to avoid reimbursing employees for items already paid for by the agency; and submitting refund requests for unused airline tickets so the taxpayers don't pay for tickets that were not used.My bill would also provide that each agency inspector general will periodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase card and travel card programs and perform periodic audits to identify potential fraudulent, improper, and abusive use of cards. We have had great success working with inspectors general using techniques like data mining to reveal instances of improper use of government charge cards. Having this information on an ongoing basis will help in strengthening and maintaining a rigorous system of internal controls to prevent future instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with government charge cards. In addition, my bill requires penalties so that employees who abuse Government charge cards cannot get away scotfree. In cases of serious misuse or fraud, the bill provides that employees must be dismissed and suspected cases of fraud will also be referred to the appropriate U.S. attorney for prosecution under Federal antifraud laws. Hopefully this will send a clear message that such activity will not be tolerated so as to act as a deterrent for others. By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):S. 3483. A bill to improve national competitiveness through enhanced education initiatives; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, the ``National Innovation Education Act''. The intent of this bill is to enhance our science and technology talent base and improve national competitiveness through strengthened education initiatives. Enhancing academic success, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math--often called the STEM disciplines--through innovative educational programs will stimulate change and growth within elementary, secondary and postsecondary institutions, improve current educational opportunities for all students, allow graduates greater opportunity for economic success and greater ability to successfully compete in the global market.This bill proposes initiatives spanning the education spectrum that seek to improve quality instruction and access to STEM learning for all students. Recent recommendations from the Council on Competitiveness and The Augustine Commission at the National Academy of Sciences, among others, target national concerns around the content and quality of K-16 in STEM disciplines, particularly with regard to minority and low-income students, the need to stimulate innovation, and the need to enhance teacher preparation and professional development in the STEM fields.An increasing number of researchers express alarm at the nearly one out of three public high school students who won't graduate and the failure of our systems to adequately prepare high school graduates, and particularly minorities, for success in college and the work place. Addressing the challenge of successfully thriving in a world of change, the Council on Competitiveness examined the pressing issue of attracting more young Americans to science and engineering fields. Currently, less than 15 percent of U.S. students have the prerequisite skills to pursue scientific or technical degrees in college. Only 5.5 percent of the 1.1 million high school seniors who took the college entrance exam in 2002 planned to pursue an engineering degree. And there continues to be poor representation of women and minorities in these fields. The National Academies report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' notes that amongst the U.S. science and technology workforce 38 percent of PhDs were foreign born. Changes need to be enacted to not only increase the number of students pursuing math and science degrees but to prepare them to pursue these degrees.Indeed, numerous national reports in recent years have called for efforts to improve K-12 education, teacher preparation and professional development in the STEM areas. Recommendations include increasing the numbers of postsecondary students pursuing careers in the areas of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology and increasing the numbers of postsecondary students in the STEM fields who will then pursue concurrent degrees in education. Increasing funding for not only STEM education but STEM research has received strong recommendations as an important and timely approach to addressing improvements in education and innovation. Finally, a critical factor to ensuring program success is the ability to engage and then hold students' interests in the various STEM fields enough to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Our bill seeks to craft a comprehensive response to many of these issues, and includes the following provisions.Title I--Improving Pre-kindergarten Through Grade 16, supplies a remedy to the critical issue of the disconnect existing between high school outcomes and college expectations. Through the formation of partnerships between P-12 and higher education systems in the states--P-16 Commissions--academic success in postsecondary education becomes the priority agenda item for reform. We anticipate that P-16 Commissions will bring about an increase in the percentage of academically prepared students, particularly low-income and minority students, and a decrease in the percentage of college students requiring remedial coursework, particularly with respect to math, science, and engineering.Many States across our country have already seen the wisdom of a P-16 Commission and have been working on goals and implementation. The results, although preliminary for many States, are vastly encouraging. Title I will provide support both to States with existing P-16 bodies, or States seeking to establish such commissions. It will give priority to the States also seeking to establish or enhance data systems. We hope that States will have an opportunity to craft a vision that will reach all students over time so that their educational pathway of access to and success in college will be ensured.Magnet schools have the capacity to create learning environments tailored to the interests and needs of its community and can offer a focused curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds. Title II of our bill authorizes the National Science Foundation to award grants to assist in the promotion of innovation and competitiveness through the development and implementation of magnet school programs. These programs would encourage students to meet state academic content standards through the development and design of innovative educational methods, practices and curricula that promote student achievement in STEM courses and encourage student enrollment in postsecondary institutions.In addition, Title II authorizes NSF grants to elementary and middle schools creating pilot programs implementing innovation-based experiential learning environments. Innovation-based experiential learning is a teaching model that seeks to seed traditional technical studies with new exposure to methods for creative thinking and translating ideas into practical applications. Such programs would likely involve immersing students in hands-on experimentation that helps students discover new concepts and use those concepts to solve real-world problems.The interrelated demands that mathematics and science education places upon schools to prepare both teachers and students must be addressed consecutively. Teachers need to be better prepared to teach STEM topics across the board and students need to have access to teachers who are well versed in their content subjects.Title III of our bill authorizes funding to increase the number of graduates from postsecondary institutions with concurrent degrees in education and STEM fields. This program is based on the successful UTeach model at the University of Texas at Austin. Encouraging science and math majors to concurrently pursue certification in the field of education will help increase the number and quality of teachers in these fields. The model program at the University of Texas has experienced impressive success in attracting and keeping promising young STEM teachers. Our bill also calls for the establishment of Teacher Professional Development Institutes to promote innovative and effective approaches to improving teacher quality by providing professional development support for educators already in the classroom. The Teacher Institute Model encourages collaboration between urban teachers and university faculty to improve student learning by enhancing teacher mastery of subject matter. It is based upon the model which has been in operation at Yale University in New Haven, CT for over 25 years.Our Nation recognizes the pressing need to increase funding for STEM research and boost the number of students in undergraduate and graduate programs pursuing mathematics and science degrees for our country's continued development, prosperity and security.Within the final title of our bill, Title IV, NSF basic research funding is doubled. NSF is authorized to expand funding for STEM education through increased fellowships and trainee programs at the undergraduate and graduate level. A clearinghouse at the National Science Foundation of successful professional science master's degree program elements will be made available to postsecondary institutions as well as grants for developing pilot programs or improving current programs. In addition the NSF Tech Talent program is reauthorized with increased funding. This program provides competitive grants to undergraduate universities to develop new methods of increasing the number of students receiving degrees in science, math, and engineering. Finally, it is in our interest to examine and understand the emerging field of services sciences, a multidisciplinary curriculum partnering science, technology, engineering, and math with management and business disciplines. To this end, the National Science Foundation will conduct a collaborative study with leaders from institutions of higher education to come to an understanding of how best to support this new field.Our National Innovation Education Act takes a broad and comprehensive approach to addressing national prosperity, security and our ability to compete internationally with recommendations for enhanced education initiatives in order to improve our national competitiveness. Improving current education for all students will allow graduates greater opportunity for economic success and greater ability to successfully compete in the global market. Our very Nation's future prosperity and security depends upon our willingness as leaders to infuse education with the requisite innovative vision that will inspire our youth to reach for goals that are achievable only beyond the ordinary bounds.I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure.

2284,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak because I believe the right participation by the U.S. Government in the educational process of our children is fundamental to our success as a nation in the next century. It is important for us to understand that we have a limited role in this area.Mr. President, 93 percent of all the funding for education--93 percent; that is basically $13 out of $14 spent in education--comes from State and local governments. Frankly, I think that is a positive, not a negative. I think when people invest their own resources, when they invest the resources they have control over, they are likely to do so very effectively.But it is appropriate, and as a matter of fact beneficial, when the Federal Government decides to be of assistance in the area of education. When we are involved, I think there ought to be some principles that we should follow in order to make sure we maximize the positive impact we can have in terms of the achievement standing of children. I use a term such as ``achievement standing'' or the ``capacity to achieve'' because I think that is what we are interested in, in education.The question is, What do we want out of education? I think we want children whose capacity to do things, whose capacity to learn, and the things that they have learned, have been enhanced substantially.It is nice to have school buildings. It is nice to have teachers. It is nice to have education programs. But ultimately, the purpose for which we develop resources and to which we devote the resources, is to elevate the capacity of children to learn.How do we improve what happens to children?I have had some opportunity to be aggressive and active in this area at the State and local level in government. Having spent 8 years as the Governor of my State, and visiting many of Missouri's 550 or so school districts, I know it is the focal point of the community in almost every setting. It is the objective of that community to elevate the standing of students, asking how do we help students do more?Different communities have found different ways of inspiring students, preparing students, building students, and elevating what happens in the classroom. I think that is what we should be involved in.During my time as Governor of the State of Missouri, the State board of education was so convinced about getting parents and teachers involved in the education of children, because it motivates children to be achievers, that we had a slogan that said: ``Success in school is homemade.''Talking about localizing what we do in education, if you take it all the way to the home, you have localized it about as much as possible.As a matter of fact, during my time as the president, or chairman--I forget the designation I carried--for the Education Commission of the States, it was an emphasis we agreed upon nationally that energizing parents and energizing the local community was the way in which we get the most return for our school dollars, as study after study has shown. And the anecdotal evidence is incredibly strong that cultures that involve parents and local officials in making decisions for what can and will work are the cultures where education succeeds.So the ingredients of public school success include the very important point of getting students motivated as a result of the active participation of their families.The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question about what are the ingredients of educational success in a report released in July of 1998. The report was called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of Federal funding and directives but instead were characterized by--here are the ingredients--parental involvement in the education of their children; two, local control; three, emphasis on basic academics; four, dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. I believe these are the ingredients that are necessary for all of us to understand if we are going to talk about elevating the performance of students, which is why we speak about this issue today, because there are noble objectives and there are programs that may sound novel and noble, but if they don't elevate the status of students, we will have failed miserably.I am concerned that too often the Federal program which finds its first consumption of resources in the administration of the program and the bureaucracy at the Federal level very frequently then goes to the State bureaucracy at the State level, but it doesn't get all the way to the student.But there is more to my concern that the proposal just doesn't get all the way to the student. Frequently, when it gets all the way to the student, it directs an activity or a devotion of the resource which is not called for in the circumstance of the student.So there are two principles that are operative here: First, that we get the resource all the way to the student so that the resource is spent in the classroom and not in the bureaucracy. The second principle is, let the resource be spent, once it is at the level of the student, on things that make a difference in terms of performance and student achievement in the classroom.It would be appropriate, I think, to have some sense of satisfaction of getting a resource all the way to the classroom and not having the shrinkage of the bureaucracy that takes the resource away. But if the resource gets to the classroom and the expenditure can only be for things that aren't needed or directly pertinent to student achievement, we will have lost the battle anyhow.Yesterday, I had the opportunity of addressing this body, and I had the unhappy task of detailing the fact that for tens of thousands of individuals at the State level in our educational effort their entire existence is consumed with filling out Federal forms; that we are serving the bureaucracy with paperwork perhaps more effectively than we are serving the students with education.If the active participation by parents, community leaders, teachers, and boards of education at the local level is what really energizes schools to elevate the level of student achievement, maybe we should not have so much direction from the Federal level about how much and where the money should be spent.I think that is pretty clear as a part of this bill which has been offered by our side; that we want to get the resources to individuals in the classroom, and not only deliver the resources to the classroom but to make sure that the best use for those resources can be determined by those who know the names of the students and the needs of the school rather than some hypothetical best use being developed a thousand miles away by bureaucrats who know, in theory, that generally the country needs X or Y but do not have very much awareness of specific needs in specific classrooms, in specific districts, in particular towns, counties, or communities all across America.So this principle is, one, to get resources to the classroom and, two, to let the people who know the names of the students and the needs of the schools make the decisions. That is of fundamental importance.When you gather at the Federal level the character of the programs and say we will make all the decisions about what is done, and we may want to get the resources to you but we will tell you what you have to do, that is the equivalent of hanging a sign on the schoolhouse door: ``Parents need not apply.'' It is the equivalent of saying to them, as much as we think you are an important part of education, you won't get to help make a decision about the way the resources are devoted, about the kind of program that is conducted, because, as a matter of fact, we will make those decisions for you in some remote bureaucracy.I think the key to what we want to do is to empower those individuals at the local level by, first, sharing the resources with them as efficiently as possible, not shrinking it by running it through bureaucracy after bureaucracy and, second, empowering them by saying, once you have the resources, you have the right and opportunity to spend it in ways you know will benefit the students in a specific setting.We have watched as we have lived with the sort of status quo in education, with the Federal Government trying to impose its ideas on the country, and we aren't showing the desired results. When you are not getting the right results, if you keep doing the same things, you are asking for difficulty. The industrialist puts it this way: Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting.If we like what we are getting in education, we should just keep doing what we are doing. But if we think we can do better --as a matter of fact, if we think we must do better for the next generation of Americans, if we recognize that the world is exploding in a technological, developmental sense, and that for people to be at the top of the list, they are going to have to be able to deal with technology and they will have to have high levels of achievement and capacity in terms of education, I think we are going to have to confess that we must do better. And in order to do better, we have to change what we are doing.It is virtually impossible to do better if we just do the same thing over and over. I think State and local governments need the kind of flexibility that we provide, and I think when we try to restrict that flexibility, when we try to restrain the capacity of the people who know best what their own children need, who witness what will motivate, on occasion, success in those students, we tell them they can't use that judgment, awareness, and knowledge, they can't use their proximity to the problem as a basis for developing a solution, as a matter of fact, we are hindering the process.I stand to speak in favor of this measure which will not only move resources to the local and State level but will provide the authority and flexibility so those resources can be devoted to students in classrooms in ways that are known by the individuals who know--teachers and students--and to the needs of the institution to improve performance. I believe that is the key.For us to persist in doing what we have done with the status quo, to persist with a system that finds more and more people disenchanted because they find their hands tied, and they want to do one thing they believe will help their students but the government says, no, they have to do something else, which isn't that helpful, or, even in order to do something else, they have to file a stack of papers that will take people out of the classroom, moves people away from education.For the Federal Government, according to a study in Florida, to administer Federal dollars, it is about six times as expensive as it is to administer a State dollar. That is six times the paperwork volume that is basically involved.We ought to begin to wonder whether those individuals who actually have the stake in the circumstances, their child in the school, why we should distrust them and impose this sort of not only rigid set of requirements but this rigid audit trail which requires six times as much administration as a State or local dollar does to deliver educational capacity to children. That is something we ought to be leery of. We ought to say, wait a second. Why would we want to spend all of that money in administration and second-guessing those who know best about their own children, their own future, and who have a stake in this issue, which is the important stake, and that is the achievement of the students?I think we ought to ask ourselves what happens in education when there is more nonteachers in the education system than there is teachers in the education system? When the administration of education and the tens of thousands of full-time equivalents across the country mandated by the Federal Government consume the resources instead of the resources getting to the classroom, we ought to ask ourselves: Is this the way for us to really be achievers?We know when people have the right opportunity to succeed and the right resources, they can get the job done--my colleagues and I have talked about it over and over again--when they have the right opportunity in terms of resources and the right authority in terms of flexibility.I think those are the two keys we have offered to the American people by this measure on our side as a way of allowing them to use the money they have paid in taxes to elevate the capacity of the students who will chart the course of America in the next century.We want for our children high levels of achievement. The children are the focus. The classroom is the focus. It is the place where it happens to those on whom we focus--the children. The ingredients of success are not great bureaucracies. They are great teachers, great classrooms, and great students. And it involves parents. When we tell parents the bureaucracy will make the decisions, we shunt them aside. We tell them they need not apply. That is a dangerous strategy and damaging to our students.Our Federal programs haven't worked, and just doing more of it won't improve our performance.My grandfather's admonition was, ``I sawed this board off more times, and it is still too short.'' If you keep sawing it will still be too short. You have to change your conduct.We should change the focus at the local level; States and local governments need the ability as it relates to teachers. As Senator Abraham said, we are not going to mandate that the States and local communities deal with teachers in any specific way. We want to authorize them to be able--with the resources they earned and paid in taxes--to devote those resources in such a way that they believe it will result in elevated performance for the students.That is the long and the short of what we ought to be doing. The status quo is unacceptable. America will not survive on a continuing basis in the long term with our students being last on the list of those among industrialized nations. It doesn't matter if we are first on the list of expenditures. It doesn't matter if we have more resources devoted to the process that is eventually sucked into the bureaucracy or devoted to things that do not pay off. What matters is that students achieve. We cannot long endure as the leader of the free world if our students are the last on the list. Being the leader and being last doesn't fit.It is time for us to focus our energies, resources, and authority to make good decisions for the elevation of student capacity. That will make a difference at the local level. That is why this measure is such an important measure.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:09:33.022020,2015-03-17 19:09:33.022020,Senate,EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT,2000-05-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-04/html/CREC-2000-05-04-pt1-PgS3453-7.htm,54,52,146,S3453-S3469,A000356,mr. ashcroft

2287,MO,Isaac Newton, IV (Ike),SKELTON,Democrat,Mr. Speaker, today, the House is considering H.R. 1105, the Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This legislation will complete the fiscal year 2009 appropriations process and keep our federal government operating through the end of the fiscal year. Taken as a whole, passing H.R. 1105 is good for our country. It invests in rural priorities, like agricultural and rural development programs, while simultaneously fostering the health, education, and safety of the American people.While I will support H.R. 1105, I am deeply disappointed that the measure includes a provision added by the Senate to authorize a $25 million study to review the original project purposes of the Missouri River as set forth by Congress, by the Missouri River Master Manual, and by the federal courts.

Or paying for our military or our education or our Medicare program?I think that really is kind of an accounting gimmick that we have seen throughout this process, to play down a lot of those serious expenses, but also to water down the quality of the debate.,2015-03-17 19:09:36.635588,2015-03-17 19:09:36.635588,House,THE CONTINUED MISDIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY,2006-05-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-05-10/html/CREC-2006-05-10-pt1-PgH2488-2.htm,56,15,152,H2488-H2495,C001060,mr. carnahan

I might add that that is our job, the Committee on Armed Services and Congress, to have oversight of the military of the United States, to ask the tough questions, because we are the ones that give them the training, the education, the equipment, the materiel. That is what we do. If we do not ask the good, tough, honest, hard-hitting questions that come up from time to time, we are not doing our job.So I thank the gentleman for raising that issue.

2308,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I am extremely pleased to cosponsor this amendment with my friend and my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). We have sponsored a number of amendments over the last several years to take dollars from the American military assistance to Colombia, and I do not do this action because I am unsympathetic to President Uribe and what he is trying to accomplish. I think he is sincerely working to break the stranglehold that drug cartels and insurgency groups have on his nation. But the message sent by cutting this funding, those messages need to reach the Colombian people, this administration and his administration.It is true, Mr. Chairman, that more is asked of the American soldier that is sent to Colombia than Colombia asks of its own soldiers. This bothers me to no end.The Colombian people need to take concerted and consistent steps to help provide for their long-term security. That means providing for a sustained financial base.Our administration needs to come forward with a long-term strategy for American military involvement in Colombia. Many in this House are worried about the creeping nature of our expanding mission in Colombia, known as mission creep. We need to know what role the American troops will play and for what period of time.Having this knowledge is even more critically important as we face a long-term commitment. Our troops have the possibility of continued work in North Korea, Liberia, not to mention Iraq. We do not have enough troops to go around the world wearing them out.We need to increase our end strength, but we have needed to do that for a while. We also need to look carefully at all of our commitments and the decisions.So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It does not eliminate all funding for Colombia, nor does it touch the critical programs like IMET, which is developing a more professional military in Colombia.I said a moment ago that more is asked of the American soldier that is down there helping them fight the rebels than they ask of their own soldiers. Every soldier in the American Army has at least a high school education or its equivalent or they cannot join. If anyone has a high school education in Colombia, they are exempt from their military conscription. If they come from wealthy families, if they have a high school education, they do not have to serve; but Americans down there to train them and trying to help beat back the rebels are more highly educated and are putting themselves on the line, when they in Colombia do not ask the same as we ask of our soldiers who are there to help them.Mr. Chairman, I resent this. I resent this very much. If they want our continued help, they should prove it by having a conscription law that cuts across all classes and all education. So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It will not injure the programs that are important whatsoever, and it will cause them in Colombia, as well as our administration, to take a good hard look at what is necessary to win in Colombia.,2015-03-17 19:09:37.566243,2015-03-17 19:09:37.566243,House,FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004,2003-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-07-23/html/CREC-2003-07-23-pt2-PgH7394.htm,110,9,149,H7394-H7444,S000465,mr. skelton
2309,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, education is the great equalizer, and getting a college education remains a part of the American dream. Yet affording that education at an institution of higher learning can be a nightmare for a prospective student or that student's family.According to a 1997 GAO report, since the early 1980s college tuition has increased by 234 percent, which of course far outpaces the cost of living or any rise in family income. Some students balance their class work with part-time jobs, others rely on financial aid packages or scholarships. This body, Mr. Speaker, has attempted in the past to ease the financial burden. Back in 1997 Congress passed and former President Clinton signed into law the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This legislation created the Hope Tax Credit as well as the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit to help families afford the cost of sending a child to college.Since then we have built on our work. We have added to the success of the 1997 bill. We have expanded education savings account. We have made prepaid tuition plans more attractive, and we have expanded the student loan interest deduction.When the merits of the Hope Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit were being considered back in 1997, the potential compliance costs for colleges and universities were raised as a potential drawback. In fact, I recall and probably the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) may recall the particular hearing we had in front of the Committee on Ways and Means and the former Treasury Secretary was appearing before us, and I asked Mr. Rubin about the compliance cost. We had been alerted to some potential substantial administrative burdens that colleges and universities were going to have to undertake, even while implementing this worthwhile legislation. I recall the answer that Mr. Rubin gave; he felt it would be a small, insignificant cost.In fact, I think he said it would be the cost of a pencil and a piece of paper. Well, as C-SPAN was covering that hearing live that day, the phone lines in our congressional office began to light up as school administrators from around the country began to call, again with this concern about this burden, this compliance cost that they would have to undertake if, in fact, we enacted the HOPE scholarship or the HOPE tax credit, as well as the lifetime learning credit and, unfortunately, their premonition has been borne out. It has been clear that our Nation's institutions of higher learning have faced significant increased administrative burdens, which brings us today.The bill before us, H.R. 3346 that has been introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo), accomplishes the goal of reducing administrative burdens on schools, while retaining the integrity of the HOPE and lifetime learning credits. We accomplish this by modifying how tuition amounts are reported and also eliminating an unneeded reporting requirement in current law that colleges and universities provide the Internal Revenue Service with the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of taxpayers who could claim students attending the school as dependents. While these changes may seem minor, I can assure my colleagues that they will greatly reduce the administrative burdens on our colleges and universities. I urge this body to be supportive of H.R. 3346.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:37.699344,2015-03-17 19:09:37.699344,House,AMENDING INTERNAL REVENUE CODE TO SIMPLIFY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS,2001-12-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-12-04/html/CREC-2001-12-04-pt1-PgH8801.htm,166,6,147,H8801-H8803,H000948,mr. hulshof

George correctly spelled ``demarche'' to win the National Spelling Bee held last week in Washington, D.C. The week prior, George placed second in the National Geography Bee, also held in Washington, D.C.I would like to offer my congratulations to this young scholar who has worked diligently to not only reach, but also win, the National Spelling Bee. George's performance has been exemplary and I'm confident it will serve to promote a heightened interest in academic achievement. George also tied for fourth place in 1998 and finished in a third place tie last year.I look forward to the continued success of Missouri home school families such as George's, and hope to continue promoting the kind of freedom that encourages parents to take an active role in guiding the course of their children's education.

2311,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme contained in this bill is nothing more than a back door vehicle for subsidizing families who want to send their children to private elementary and secondary schools. It is designed to create a tax shelter for families of high incomes, while leaving nothing for families that don't even have enough to pay for their retirement.According to the Department of Education, these tax provisions would give an average tax break of $96 for families earning $150,000. However, for poor families, the average benefit would be only $1.Rather than pursuing this shamefully regressive tax scheme, we should strengthen our public schools, where 90 percent of our Nation's children attend. We should address the problems of leaky roofs and overcrowded classrooms. We should target funds for school renewal in our country's poorest school districts. Finally, we should move to reduce class sizes--a proven strategy for enhancing student achievement.,2015-03-17 19:09:38.177684,2015-03-17 19:09:38.177684,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2646, EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1998,1998-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-18/html/CREC-1998-06-18-pt1-PgH4727-5.htm,80,49,144,H4727-H4739,C000488,mr. clay

2319,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, this Republican budget reminds me of a movie I saw a few years ago called ``Groundhog Day.'' In the movie, Bill Murray, who is the star, keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Everything happens to him the same way.This budget, which has been advertised as a real change, when you examine it, when you open the package that has been repackaged, is really the same thing. It is said to be a moderate budget. It is not a moderate budget. It is warmed over tax cuts for the wealthy, rehashed cuts in Medicare, in Medicaid, reconstituted cuts in education and the environment.For 17 months, the President, the Democrats have been waiting for the Republicans to come to the sensible center so that we could get a budget done. The Republicans have been offered a balanced budget plan made up entirely of cuts that the Republicans support, but it is never good enough. We cannot seem to get the compromise, the consensus that we need to get this done.This budget still raises taxes.Now listen to this. I said it in the last budget debate:This budget raises taxes on working people who are at the bottom, trying to get in the middle class, while it cuts dramatically taxes on capital gains, most of which goes to the wealthiest Americans. How can anyone argue that this is fair, that this is sensible, that this is pragmatic, that this is what we ought to be doing in this country?It still cuts Medicare and Medicaid way too much. That would not have to be done if we simply gave up the tax break for the wealthiest Americans, if we just focus the tax break on middle-income people and people trying to get in the middle class. We would not need as deep a cut in Medicare and Medicaid and in education.And then if we look at the list that comes out of discretionary spending, it is too long for me to read this afternoon. Job training in vocational education, cut by more than $1 billion; national direct student loans, eliminated entirely; libraries across the country cut by one-fifth; 24 education programs eliminated entirely; Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health, gone; rural housing eliminated; rural health, gone; agricultural extension and research, gone.The list goes on. I could read it all afternoon.These are efforts that everybody could agree are good for the future of this country that only, only the government will perform if this country is to move forward.Now let me end with this:This budget for the second year in a row is not going to happen. The President will veto the implementation of this budget, and what I cannot understand, my friends in the Republican Party, we now have 2 years of no progress.I know my colleagues did not like the President's budget in 1993, but it cut the deficit in half, and most importantly, it got done.This country is not a parliamentary system. Our colleagues cannot do it their way alone. They have to come to the middle, and we have to find a compromise to move this country forward. if our colleagues continue being obstinate and resolute in wanting to do it their way or no way, we get nothing done for the American people.Let us vote this budget down, let us get a budget back on this floor that is somewhere out here in the middle that everybody in this body can support, and let us get this deficit down and balance this budget as we should have done a long time ago.This budget will not live.

I led the fight with Chairman John Chafee and Chairman John Warner to make sure we put the trust back in trust fund; that is, we told the American people that we would send back, for highways, the money in the trust fund as it increased. In this budget he proposes more boutique programs. He wants to go back on the promise we made last year. We have great highway needs and there is absolutely no reason to get more Federal programs when it is the States who need to build the highways.

2323,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 84 calls for increased funding for IDEA at the expense of initiatives like the Clinton/Clay Class Size Reduction Act. While I support increased funding for IDEA, we should not be robbing Peter to pay Paul.Achieving the goal of 100,000 new teachers will ensure that every child receives personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning, and is prepared to read by the end of the third grade.I am disappointed that the Republicans have continued their attempt to torpedo this critical program. On the Ed-Flex bill, Republicans tried to raid class size funds for other programs. We should never pit one program against another--we should support overall increases in education spending.I believe that reducing class sizes with well-qualified teachers is the single most significant action we can take to enhance student achievement.We should increase funding for IDEA, but not at the expense of class size reduction.,2015-03-17 19:09:40.656440,2015-03-17 19:09:40.656440,House,URGING CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT TO FULLY FUND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT,1999-05-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-04/html/CREC-1999-05-04-pt1-PgH2563-4.htm,63,55,145,H2563-H2570,C000488,mr. clay

Riley, from the Fourth Circuit, found that the plain language of IDEA did not condition the receipt of IDEA funds on the continued provision of educational services to expelled children with disabilities and that in order for Congress to place conditions on the State's receipt of funds, Congress must do so clearly and unambiguously. Therefore, that is one of the reasons the law was changed following that.,2015-03-17 19:09:40.801550,2015-03-17 19:09:40.801550,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-19/html/CREC-1999-05-19-pt1-PgS5507-7.htm,73,453,145,S5507-S5583,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2325,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999, President Clinton's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). This proposal will reinvigorate our commitment to high standards and achievement in every classroom; improve teacher and principal quality to ensure high-quality instruction for all children; strengthen accountability for results; and ensure safe, healthy, orderly and drug-free school environments where all children can learn.Established in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, the ESEA opened a new era of Federal support for education, particularly for students who would gain the most: children in our high-poverty communities and those at-risk of educational failure. Today, the ESEA authorizes the Federal government's single largest investment in elementary and secondary education. Through this Act, the Congress and the President will reaffirm and strength the Federal role in promoting academic excellence and equal educational opportunity for every American.This reauthorization of ESEA comes at a critical time for our country. The restructuring of ESEA that was done during the last review in 1994, to establish challenging State-developed standards and assessments, put us on the path to greater academic achievement for all students. This legislation builds upon this focus and targets improvement towards the lowest performing schools and students through comprehensive interventions and assistance, and if necessary, requires consequences for continual failure of schools. Overall, this reauthorization gives Congress the opportunity to complete the work done in 1994 by strengthening our focus on quality and accountability for results.Coupled with the strong emphasis on achievement in this bill is an equally vigorous and complimentary focus on improving the quality of our teaching force. Qualified teachers are the most single critical in-school factor in improving student achievement. Unfortunately, too many of our teachers still do not receive on-going high-quality professional development. This bill refocuses the professional development programs in ESEA to bring the challenging academic standards which all States have developed into the classroom. In addition, this legislation authorizes the President's high-promising 100,000 teacher class-size program enacted as a part of last year's appropriation process. We must ensure that all children in America have talented, dedicated, teachers in small classes and this bill puts on this path.Another important priority in this legislation is the fostering of supportive learning environments that reduces the likelihood of disruptive behavior and school violence while encouraging personal growth and academic development. This legislation strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Act by emphasizing the funding of research-based approaches to violence prevention; expands the comprehensive prevention efforts through the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative; and encourages reform of America's high schools through increased individualized attention and learning.In 1994, Congress and the President worked together to raise standards for all children and to provide a quality education for them to achieve those standards. Five years later, there is evidence that standards-based reform has increased achievement in many states, while helping spark reforms in others. With this bill, we must build upon the accomplishments of 1994. We can no longer tolerate lower expectations and results for poor and disadvantaged students. We must take the next step by helping schools and teachers bring high standards into every classroom and help every child achieve. The legislation I am introducing today will provide us with the tools to accomplish these vital missions.,2015-03-17 19:09:41.013694,2015-03-17 19:09:41.013694,Extensions,INTRODUCTION OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR ALL CHILDREN ACT OF 1999,1999-05-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-26/html/CREC-1999-05-26-pt1-PgE1107.htm,77,0,145,E1107,C000488,mr. clay

2327,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.Madam Chairman, next April will mark the 35th anniversary of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a flagship great society program that underscored our country's national commitment to help communities improve their public schools.We have come a long way since the deplorable, segregated, and neglected public schools of yesteryear, but not far enough. Today, too many States and too many communities lack either the political will or the financial resources to ensure that poor children get a good education. Too many poor communities lack fully qualified teachers, safe schools, and access to emerging school technology.Recent reports show that title I is making strides in increasing student achievement. Ten of 12 urban school districts and five of six States reviewed showed increases in the percentage of students in the highest poverty schools who met district or State standards for proficiency in reading and math. These results should serve to broaden our commitment to increase investment in public schools while strengthening accountability for results.I support this legislation because it strengthens our commitment to improve educational opportunities for students, regardless of their race, economic status. Or special needs. It targets funds to our most disadvantaged children and schools, it requires States to have rigorous standards and assessments, and it increases the title I authorization to $8.35 billion.The bill imposes strong sanctions for schools who continue to fail after receiving substantial assistance. It also ensures that teachers and teacher aides are fully qualified. I am very pleased that we will include title VII, bilingual education, as part of the manager's amendment, and I commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Martinez), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa), and the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Romero-Barcelo) on our committee who helped forge a compromise on this critical program.Madam Chairman, H.R. 2 clearly prohibits the use of title I funds for private school vouchers. The proposal to allow vouchers was overwhelmingly rejected by our committee members.The bill is not a perfect bill, however. There are some provisions that undermine programs for women's equity in education, that repeal the Women's Educational Equity Act, that eliminate the provision that trains teachers to eliminate gender bias in the classroom, and terminates dropout prevention programs for pregnant and parenting teens. The gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) have prepared amendments to restore these provisions, and I hope that this body will vote in favor of them.Madam Chairman, I want to thank the subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), for his work on this bill and the committee members on our side, each of whom made important contributions to the bill. I also want to thank the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), and the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle), for working with us in a bipartisan manner.I urge support of H.R. 2.Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:41.354936,2015-03-17 19:09:41.354936,House,STUDENT RESULTS ACT OF 1999,1999-10-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-20/html/CREC-1999-10-20-pt1-PgH10408.htm,143,25,145,H10408-H10423,C000488,mr. clay
2328,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Madam President, the budget already includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to assist servicemembers and veterans. It contains a provision supporting the transition of our military to the workforce by recognizing the process is too cumbersome for them in terms of credentialing requirements and licensing requirements.What my amendment does is it clarifies this section to ensure that a servicemember's military training, education, and experience shall be taken into account for both Federal and State licensing requirements.These men and women have performed technical jobs in the most difficult circumstances imaginable. We should recognize that and accept their service and their experience and their training and allow them to be easily credentialed when they return home. It helps them so much in the search for jobs.I would ask for a voice vote.,2015-03-17 19:09:41.495042,2015-03-17 19:09:41.495042,Senate,CONCURRENT BUDGET RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2014,2013-03-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-03-22/html/CREC-2013-03-22-pt1-PgS2235-6.htm,43,944,159,S2235-S2320,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

2330,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the important issues we are facing today regarding education. I admire the passion with which my colleague from Connecticut has spoken. I simply come to a different conclusion. I think that if we really admire those individuals who work at the local level, we won't distrust them to allocate the resources for their children in their communities, to make good decisions about how the moneys are spent. That is a real contrast to what we have had for quite some time.I wish to give a few examples about how Federal education program requirements eat up resources and they consume a disproportionate amount of the time that States and schools spend on administration. You see, when my constituents come to talk to me, they don't ask me about the process. They are asking me about the product. They are asking me can the students read? Can they spell? Can they compute? Can they reason? They want to be focused on student achievement. They don't want to be focused on whether the money is going to the State or whether the money is going to the Federal bureaucracy. They want something to happen at the end of the process that changes the lives of individuals.As we get into a culture that is more and more technically oriented, the need for education is elevated more and more. In fact, we need to make sure that the money not only gets to the local level, but when it gets there, it can do something of value. And we have a couple of big problems with our current situation. They are primarily these:No. 1, we may get the money to the local level, but only what is left of it after the Federal government and the State bureaucracies consume it with their bureaucratic redtape. So there is a small stream, a very anemic flow, that goes to the local community.No. 2, when we finally get it there, we are frequently telling people at the local community that they have to spend it for something the local community knows isn't really very important.Very few of us would want to get our help, for instance, medically, from someone who was 1,000 miles away and who didn't know anything about our condition. We would want someone who could examine us to find where our problems are and direct a therapy to address those problems. Federal programs from 1,000 miles away designed to make things uniform frequently don't work, and it is because the conditions are different in each community.My colleague from Connecticut boasted of Connecticut's ability to provide uniform salaries for teachers. Then he talked about how unsuccessful it was to have the same salary in one place that you have in another place because the conditions are different. Maybe we should conclude something based on that--that uniformity may not be the answer. Maybe we should conclude that we should give individuals an opportunity to tailor, to adjust, to refine, and to define the resource and its application so that we could have a cause and effect, which is what we are looking for.What is it we are looking for? We are looking for an elevated classroom capacity. We are looking for an elevated human capacity. We are looking for students who can read, write, spell, decipher, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. That is what we want from our schools. That isn't really different from the culture at large.We have passed the century of mass products. Henry Ford was the master of mass production in the 1930s. He said, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so long as it is black.'' He had the best idea, and a centrally driven idea that everybody would drive the same color car. The problem was that 10 years later, after he had 75 percent of the automotive market, he had 50 percent of the automotive market, and he began to understand that it wasn't appropriate to try to tell everybody what they wanted or what their needs were. He changed his slogan. Instead of, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so long as it is black,'' he just shortened it to say, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it''--because he knew he had better meet the need.It is time for us to stop saying you can have your education any color you want it so long as it is bureaucratic. It is time for us to say we want to help you elevate the capacity of students. We are not interested in bureaucracy. We are not interested even in bureaucracy at the State level. We are interested in students. We are interested in classrooms. We are not interested in interest groups. We want to elevate the capacity of students.Listen to what has happened in the Federal Government. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork every year in order for people to receive Federal dollars. That is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time. That is a real cost--25,000 full-time equivalents just processing Federal paperwork. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications States must fill out to receive Federal education funds each year.The Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the smallest Federal Government agencies with only 4,637 people. State agencies, however, have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs, full-time equivalents with Federal dollars to administer the myriad of Federal programs. That doesn't always reflect the total that is necessary at the local level. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally funded employees at State education agencies administering Federal programs as there are U.S. Department of Education employees.I think we need to be thinking carefully about getting the resources to the students. We are facing a situation today in the United States of America where more than half of all the employees in public education are outside the classroom. No wonder people are wondering whether or not we are getting a return on our investment.Where do we want to focus our investment? Do we want to feed the bureaucracy and build the bureaucracy, or do we want to fund the classroom and elevate student performance? We have to look carefully at that.In the State of Florida, it takes 374 employees to administer $8 billion in State funds. It takes almost 400 to do $8 billion in State funds. For the $1 billion in Federal funds, it takes almost 300 employees. Basically, there are six times as many hours required to administer one dollar of Federal funds as there are hours required to administer one dollar of State funds. That puts us in a situation where there is a lot of money being spent on administration trying to make sure we have complied with all of the Federal requirements and working to satisfy the Federal mandate instead of working to educate the children.I submit that we ought to look at these statistics. We find that it is not surprising that the Federal bureaucratic maze consumes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars. These Federal programs and their requirements take away not only precious dollars, but they take up valuable teacher time.I don't think there is much question about what we want. I don't think this is a partisan issue. All of us in the end want students to be able to achieve. The educational system is not for the bureaucracy. It is not for Washington. It is not for the State capitals. It is not for making people fill out forms to comply with Federal rules. Clearly, we can't afford for this trend to continue. We need to change our Federal policies to ensure a more efficient use of our Federal resources. I would be pleased to yield to the manager on my side for a comment or unanimous consent request.,2015-03-17 19:09:41.762228,2015-03-17 19:09:41.762228,Senate,EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Resumed,2000-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-03/html/CREC-2000-05-03-pt1-PgS3284-2.htm,53,140,146,S3284-S3322,A000356,mr. ashcroft

2335,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the rich heritage and invaluable contributions that Jewish Americans have made to our Nation and to the community that I am proud to represent in Missouri's First Congressional District.The earliest Jewish immigrants came to St. Louis over two hundred years ago.Like most new Americans, they came seeking a refuge from persecution and discrimination, with the hope of building productive lives and practicing their faith, without fear.In St. Louis, and across the Nation, Jewish Americans have excelled in every facet of our society. From commerce, to the arts, to education, medicine, the law, government, and in our armed forces.Jewish Americans have enriched our Nation and contributed much to our shared cultural heritage.I also want to make special mention of the long and historic partnership between the African American and the Jewish American communities, in the pursuit of social justice, civil rights, voting rights and equal protection under the law.During the most trying times of the civil rights movement, Jewish Americans and African Americans marched together, stood together, protested together, prayed together, and even died together, to advance the cause of full citizenship and real equality for all.That partnership and common pursuit of justice endures today.In my district, I am blessed to represent a large, vibrant Jewish community with many outstanding congregations, educational and cultural groups and social service agencies; including: the Jewish Federation of St. Louis; the Jewish Community Center; Jewish Family and Childrens Services; the Jewish Community Relations Council; the St. Louis Holocaust Museum and Learning Center, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the Central Agency for Jewish Education, and many others.Jewish Americans have helped shape our Nation's history, and their unending commitment to faith, family, learning and social justice will continue to strengthen the United States.I am proud to join with my colleagues to mark Jewish American Heritage Month.,2015-03-17 19:09:42.684888,2015-03-17 19:09:42.684888,Extensions,JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH,2010-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-05-20/html/CREC-2010-05-20-pt1-PgE907-2.htm,77,0,156,E907,C001049,mr. clay
2336,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Yes.So the point is, what do we do here in America? We basically have to stop thinking that the Federal Government is God and that it's going to solve every problem. We've got the Federal Government now, they're into the automobile business, the insurance business, the student loan business, they're in the flood insurance business, they're in the food business, they're in the housing business.It kind of reminds me, there was this country that I grew up paying close attention to in the U.S., and it had this philosophy that the government is going to give you food, and it's going to give you a place to live, some shelter, it's going to give you an education, the government's going to give you a job and it's going to give you health care. We looked at that country and thought, That's not going to work. And it didn't work. The whole country crashed economically. It was called the USSR.Here we are today, and what does the Federal Government try to do? Give people housing and food and education and a job and health care. How are we different? What we have to understand is the Federal Government has to be reined in to do just what it's supposed to do, which is justice. That is, provide a set of laws where everybody is equal before the law and a national security that protects us from terrorists and other people that wish us ill. So that Federal Government is just going to have to go on a diet.,2015-03-17 19:09:42.816981,2015-03-17 19:09:42.816981,House,THE GOVERNMENT, THE ECONOMY AND JOBS,2010-07-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-07-14/html/CREC-2010-07-14-pt1-PgH5603.htm,104,69,156,H5603-H5610,A000358,mr. akin
2337,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Catholic Schools Week.Next week, the Nation's nearly 8,000 Catholic schools will celebrate Catholic Schools Week. Catholic schools have made many significant contributions to the education of our Nation's children.In the Greater St. Louis region, Catholic schools have had a longstanding and proud tradition in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The percentage of Catholic families who choose Catholic schools for their children is among the highest in the country. Currently, there are about 51,000 students enrolled in our Catholic elementary and high schools.Catholic schools foster an atmosphere of mutual respect. Students learn to value God, themselves, and others. As Pope Benedict XVI noted in his remarks at Catholic University during his Apostolic Visit to the U.S. last spring, ``Education is integral to the mission of the Church to proclaim the Good News. First and foremost every Catholic educational institution is a place to encounter the living God who in Jesus Christ reveals his transforming love and truth. This relationship elicits a desire to grow in the knowledge and understanding of Christ and his teaching. In this way those who meet him are drawn by the very power of the Gospel to lead a new life characterized by all that is beautiful, good, and true; a life of Christian witness nurtured and strengthened within the community of our Lord's disciples, the Church.''Today I would like to recognize and commend our Catholic educators who are committed to a living and vibrant faith community founded on the Catholic tradition of academic excellence and thank them for enriching the lives of the children they teach spiritually, academically and socially.I strongly support the goals of Catholic Schools Week 2009 and laud their efforts to educate students dedicated to their faith, families, and values.,2015-03-17 19:09:42.963108,2015-03-17 19:09:42.963108,House,HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2009-01-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-21/html/CREC-2009-01-21-pt1-PgH398.htm,12,21,155,H398-H402,A000358,mr. akin

2339,MO,Todd,Akin,R,If you would yield, gentleman, one of the things somebody once said--and I was not a whiz on taking history in high school--but if you don't learn from history, you are bound to repeat mistakes. And I do recall a very threatening and ominous nation that we saw taking over country after country called the Soviet Union. If you were to try to just simplify their philosophy, it was that government was going to take care of food, clothing and shelter. They were going to pay for your education, set you up with a job, and take care of your health care. We laughed when that country collapsed, a little bit with a sense of anxiety because they had nuclear weapons aimed at us and all. We said, you know that Communist/Socialist stuff won't work. Their economy was a mess. They couldn't keep up with us in the arms race because their economy was a disaster. The government can't run all that stuff efficiently. People starved to death over there. Their medical care was so abysmal, people that went into their hospitals would shudder. There was no anaesthetic, no clean bandages. It was a disaster.And when the whole thing went down the drain, we said, Everybody knows Communism/Socialism won't work. So what are we proposing now? The government's going to provide food. The government's going to provide housing. The government's going to provide your education. We just decided to nationalize a whole lot more of that. No more private loans. We're going to have the government take care of all that. And now we're talking about the government--not only the insurance and the automotive, but now the government wants to take over one-fifth of the economy in terms of health care.Now, it seems to me we should learn something from history, don't you think, gentleman?,2015-03-17 19:09:43.251292,2015-03-17 19:09:43.251292,House,FREE ENTERPRISE AND THE INVISIBLE HAND,2009-09-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-16/html/CREC-2009-09-16-pt1-PgH9646.htm,131,10,155,H9646-H9653,A000358,mr. akin

Under their leadership, our committee has produced a remarkable amount of quality legislation, including this bill before the House tonight.Our country's global competitiveness is directly linked to the ability of our math, science and engineering professionals to develop innovative technologies, policies and scientific breakthroughs.Yet while it is important to support these professionals and their industries today, it is perhaps of even greater importance to support their professions and industries of tomorrow.In order for our Nation to compete with countries around the world, we must ensure that we increase the educational opportunities for our youth to study and pursue careers in math, science and engineering, while also investing in programs to enrich the quality of these opportunities.Making both research and the education of our children a national priority is not simply an investment in these fields. Our global competitiveness is directly tied to our Nation's economy and national security.NSF plays a critical role in influencing our global competitiveness as it supports science and engineering across all disciplines.Each year NSF supports an average of about 200,000 scientists, engineers, educators and students at universities, laboratories and field sites all over the U.S., including many great institutions in my home State of Missouri.H.R. 1867 authorizes the necessary funds for NSF which will allow the agency to foster relationships between academia and industry in order to spawn U.S. competitiveness and further the Agency's traditions of education in science, technology, engineering and math, the STEM, fields.I urge my colleagues to invest in the future of our children, in our country's global competitiveness and support this bill.

Catholic schools not only teach our kids how to think, but also teach them how to live.Catholic schools have always been known for their high academic standards and excellent teachers, but I would like to draw your attention to their ability to provide more than just an excellent academic education. The Catholic schools in my district are a perfect example of this--providing children from a young age with a moral foundation which leads them to serve their community through out their lives.It was strong religious and moral beliefs that drove our Nation's Founders to develop a country where individual freedom is coupled with individual responsibility. Catholic schools across our great Nation continue to produce students who understand their responsibility and act accordingly. The values imparted and the strong faith that Catholic schools develop in their students produces citizens who understand the importance of service and diligently work for the good of our country. I am honored to represent a district where numerous Catholic schools provide a rigorous academic education and a moral compass to guide students through their lives. Catholic schools in Missouri's Second Congressional District and throughout the St. Louis region produce well-rounded and morally grounded members of our community. The teachers, administrators, parents, and students of Catholic schools deserve this recognition for the tremendously positive impact they have on our Nation.

The Missouri Legislature and State board of education were in the forefront and enacted standards-based education long before the passage of No Child Left Behind. In fact, the standards set in Missouri are among the highest in the Nation. Under the able instructional leadership of Dr. Doerrer, the Ritenour School District has not only met but in many cases has exceeded the rigorous goals our State has set for student achievement of adequate yearly progress. In addition, under Dr. Doerrer's able leadership, the Ritenour School District was recently named as one of the ``Best Places to Work'' by the St. Louis Business Journal.Dr. Doerrer has truly exemplified instructional leadership in our State. Whether it is staff development, instructional technology, human resources, or data driven decisionmaking, Dr. Doerrer has provided the vision and energy that has brought distinction to the Ritenour School District.

2345,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, S. Con. Res. 114, sponsored by my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Jim McGovern, calls to attention one of America's most important humanitarian missions--alleviating the suffering of the world's starving children. Hunger claims more lives worldwide than HIV and AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined; a tragedy.Critical to feeding starving children is the McGovern-Dole International Food and Education and Child Nutrition Program, which provides hungry children around the world at least one nutritious meal each day in a school setting. This program has proven effective at reducing child hunger, increasing academic attendance and performance, and strengthening community commitment to education.The McGovern-Dole program currently feeds two million children a year. That's two million children who will attend school. Two million children who will not have to suffer through an afternoon of stomach pain from too little nutrition. Two million children who will grow up knowing that America cares, that America is willing to help those most in need. Today, more than ever, it is vital that individuals living in impoverish areas across the world look to the United States as an ally, and more than that, a partner.For these reasons, I am encouraged to see that the Agriculture Appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year, that the House overwhelmingly passed yesterday, included a $25 million increase for the McGovern-Dole program. Chairman Henry Bonilla of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am a member, demonstrated his compassion for the world's malnourished children by supporting the President's proposed increase for this program. This increase will make a significant difference.This resolution is right on target: A humanitarian crisis exists in the world and the McGovern-Dole program is part of the solution. I urge my colleagues to support this meaningful resolution.,2015-03-17 19:09:44.118931,2015-03-17 19:09:44.118931,House,CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD IN SCHOOLS TO HUNGRY OR MALNOURISHED CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD,2004-07-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-07-14/html/CREC-2004-07-14-pt1-PgH5752.htm,97,13,150,H5752-H5757,E000172,mrs. emerson

2347,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 150th anniversary of Culver-Stockton College, which is located in Canton, Missouri.Culver-Stockton College was founded as Christian University by early leaders of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Canton, Missouri was chosen as the school's location based on the close proximity to the Mississippi River and the enthusiasm for higher education shared by the Lewis County Disciples. The State of Missouri issued the college's charter on January 28, 1853. In 1917, Christian University was renamed Culver-Stockton College to honor benefactors Mary Culver and Robert Stockton.Culver-Stockton's visionary founders were clearly ahead of their time. The school was the first college chartered west of the Mississippi River to educate both men and women. As both Christian University and Culver-Stockton College, the school has compiled a proud record of accomplishment and has made a meaningful contribution to the community throughout its history.The forward-thinking ideas that are the foundation for Culver-Stockton College still influence the school today. Culver-Stockton is a 4-year residential, coeducational college that asks its students to realize their full potential. The college's alumni are living proof of the professional, personal and social service development that is cultivated on Culver-Stockton's campus. The college's administration, faculty and staff are committed to educational excellence, character development, and the integration of liberal arts.In recent years, Culver-Stockton has achieved distinctions that include being named one of America's Best Christian Colleges, inclusion in the Templeton Foundation's ``Colleges that Encourage Character Development'' and membership in the Lilly Fellows Program in Humanities and the Arts.With its Sesquicentennial Gala Week, Culver-Stockton College launches a year-long celebration of its 150-year history. This provides the opportunity to not only reflect on the school's past contributions, but to appreciate the important role the college continues to play in educating our future leaders.

These endowment programs are vital to supporting the creation, preservation and presentation of the arts and humanities in America. In my district of Kansas City, Missouri, NEA and NEH grants have brought partnership projects such as the Coterie Theater and the Friends of Alvin Ailey's AileyCamp that help provide collaborative artist and youth activities which have enriched the local economy and educational experiences of our children.Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. A U.S. Department of Justice study found that arts education reduced student delinquency in San Antonio by 13 percent and increased the communications skills of students in Atlanta by 57 percent. Test Results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores than other students.There is no excuse for funding for the NEA at a level that is 30 percent below the 1994 level. Adopting the amendment before us would increase funding by $10 million for NEA and $5 million for the NEH. This would bring NEA and NEH funding to the level that the House approved last year by a vote of 234-192, but was later stripped from the bill in conference. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

This month marks the 50th anniversary of Central Bank's service to the residents and businesses of Northeast Kansas City.Chartered in August of 1950, this financial institution has remained a stronghold in the community throughout the cultural and economic changes and growth that have occurred since it opened its doors. Through expansion and innovative services, Central Bank has demonstrated and continues to live up to its commitment and dedication to Northeast Kansas City.The American Bankers Association Banking Journal considers Central Bank of Kansas City one of the top performing banks in its category. A leader in community development, the bank joined with Old Northeast, Inc. Community Development Corporation, in 1999, to construct thirty new homes in the Northeast Community for low and moderate income families. Central Bank has also partnered with the Kansas City Neighborhood Alliance and Bishop Sullivan Community Center in an effort to revitalize housing in the Blue Valley neighborhood. In addition to promoting housing and small business initiatives such as the First Step Fund designed to assist small business entrepreneurs, they serve on the Safe Neighborhood Grant Advisory Council, which addresses the quality of life for the residents.Quality education is another priority of Central Bank. They participate in the ``Bank at School'' program which gives fifth grade students basic bank training. They participate on various boards such as the national Academy Foundation's business partnership for American education.Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in celebrating the 50th anniversary of Central Bank of Kansas City. Its outstanding leadership serves the community well. Its continuing commitment to Old Northeast assures the vitality of this historic neighborhood.,2015-03-17 19:09:44.721336,2015-03-17 19:09:44.721336,Extensions,IN HONOR OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CENTRAL BANK OF KANSAS CITY,2001-03-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-14/html/CREC-2001-03-14-pt1-PgE353-2.htm,34,0,147,E353,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2350,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today on National Teachers Day in honor of this important day.I was able to cosponsor this legislation along with the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Clement), my co-chair of the House Education Caucus, with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman Goodling) and the gentleman from California (Chairman McKeon) and others.One out of five Members of the House, including the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), who drafted this resolution, have been full-time educators at one time in their career. Members of this House know from personal experience what it is like to be in the classroom, to be an administrator, to work with the responsibilities of teachers.This resolution honors and recognizes the unique and important achievement of America's teachers. It urges all Americans to take a moment to thank teachers and pay tribute to our Nation's teachers.I would like to mention just briefly a teacher in the Springfield school district that is being recognized this week as the Teacher of the Year in that district.Ms. Mae Tribble originally aspired to be a pediatric nurse so she could help others in need. However, while she was in college at Southwest Missouri State University and while working with the Springfield Park Board, she discovered the challenge and the reward of teaching. She has now taught for 27 years. She currently teaches the second grade at Pittman Elementary School. She has taught at other schools in the Springfield district and the Strafford district. Her education includes teaching first grade, second grade, disabilities K-6, reading and math. She is an outstanding teacher.Teachers make a difference in people's lives, Mr. Speaker. They expand our only expandable resource, the potential of young people, the potential of our country. I am glad we recognize them today.,2015-03-17 19:09:44.877440,2015-03-17 19:09:44.877440,House,SENSE OF THE HOUSE IN SUPPORT OF AMERICA'S TEACHERS,2000-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-09/html/CREC-2000-05-09-pt1-PgH2726.htm,56,10,146,H2726-H2734,B000575,mr. blunt
2351,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my constituents who passed away several years ago after a long, rich life. The community is still impacted by her wonderful example of patience and kindness. I salute Mrs. Roberta Rowe who, 26 years after her passing, will have a park in Sikeston, MO, rededicated to her for her inspirational life.Originally from Georgia, Mrs. Roberta Rowe came to Southeast Missouri with her five children, Mable, Alma, Eloise, Kathryn, and Carlton.She soon became involved in her community as the leader of the Rainbow 4-H Club where she held meetings, arranged educational projects for the members and accompanied the club to Lincoln University every year for the annual state conference.Mrs. Rowe was also an active member in Smith Chapel United Methodist Church throughout her life. She was a kindergarten teacher for the church, and often worked with the children in various activities. You could always find her cheerful spirit at a church function.Always involved with the Bootheel community, Mrs. Rowe traveled with the Community Choir for monthly choir concerts in the African American Churches of the region. Monthly she would go to Benton along with her Smith Chapel friends, Mrs. Rosie Johnson, Mrs. Flora Holt, and Ms. Edna to learn about effective homemaking techniques through the University of Missouri Extension Club. She served as a teen supervisor during the summer, teaching them about lawncare and lawnscaping.Although she did not complete high school herself, she pushed her children to pursue a strong education. Her twins, Carlton and Kathryn, completed college at Lincoln University, and the rest of her children spent time in college as well.Mrs. Rowe's dedication to her family, her church, her community and education should be an inspiration to us all. Those who followed her example learned that ``greatness comes from service.'' It is her greatness that is remembered in Sikeston, and by her family.,2015-03-17 19:09:45.022549,2015-03-17 19:09:45.022549,Extensions,RECOGNIZING ROBERTA ROWE FOR A LIFETIME OF COMMUNITY SERVICE,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgE1862-4.htm,132,0,146,E1862,E000172,mrs. emerson
2352,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a truly outstanding University in my home State of Missouri, Lincoln University. Lincoln has played a large role in African American education in my home State of Missouri, as well as across the nation.Lincoln was founded in 1866 by the Caucasian officers and the African American enlisted men of the 62nd and 65th United States Colored Infantries who fought for the Union during the Civil War. These men wanted to establish a school that would devote itself to educating freed African Americans. By soliciting funds and donating their own salaries, they raised $6,000 within a few days. With these funds, the soldiers were able to open the doors of Lincoln Institute on September 17, 1866. In 1869, Lincoln began to receive $5,000 in aid from the State of Missouri for teacher training. By 1940, Lincoln Institute had become Lincoln University and had evolved from a teacher training school to a full University offering Graduate instruction. In each of the decades Lincoln has continually added programs, expanded its facilities and opened its doors to all applicants that meet its entrance criteria.This past year the University has come under the new leadership of Dr. David Henson. Dr. Henson became the seventeenth President of Lincoln on July 2, 1997. I am excited about continuing my close relationship with this outstanding University by working with Dr. Henson. He has held many leadership positions during his 25 years of higher education and I know he will continue to strengthen the University's already impeccable reputation.It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a University like Lincoln, whose service and character-building programs, along with the new guidance of Dr. Henson, will continue down the road of success. I commend Lincoln's President, Dr. David Henson, for his commitment to excellence and hope for continued prosperity in the future. ,2015-03-17 19:09:45.165652,2015-03-17 19:09:45.165652,Senate,TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN UNIVERSITY,1998-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-31/html/CREC-1998-03-31-pt1-PgS2877-3.htm,39,0,144,S2877-S2878,B000611,mr. bond

Now, more than ever, we must rely on the skills and productivity of American workers. Education and job training programs provide the opportunity to learn and improve skills. We must make sure that those programs are as effective as possible. So I am pleased to be a part of the effort to improve the quality of our education and training system, while eliminating duplication of efforts and unnecessary bureaucracy.Let me express my gratitude to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for their hard work on the House legislation. Also, for their continued efforts to move this bill through conference and on to the President's desk.I am pleased that there is broad agreement, Mr. Speaker, one, to foster the development of one-stop intake systems that will provide comprehensive information on the kinds of assistance available to those seeking help; two, to tailor job training assistance to the particular needs of each individual; three, to provide those seeking assistance with comprehensive consumer information about the quality of programs; four, to improve the quality of training and the accountability of the system; and five, to streamline and coordinate the delivery of services.Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the conference report.Mr. Speaker, continuing my reservation of objection, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon).,2015-03-17 19:09:45.309776,2015-03-17 19:09:45.309776,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1385, WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998,1998-07-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-31/html/CREC-1998-07-31-pt1-PgH6865.htm,106,4,144,H6865-H6867,C000488,mr. clay
2354,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce on the event of its 40th anniversary. This chamber has faithfully served the cities of Ballwin, Clarkson Valley, Ellisville, Manchester, Valley Park, Wildwood, Winchester, and parts of unincorporated St. Louis County, MO.Established on May 13, 1957, as the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, the chamber was founded to enrich the communities of the West St. Louis County corridor. At its first meeting held in the basement of Ballwin Elementary School, the chamber dedicated itself to improving the quality of education, highways, and sewer systems. From these humble beginnings, the West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce has grown into one of the most dynamic and progressive chambers in this region. With 385 members and 601 representatives, the chamber continues to advance commercial, industrial, and civic interest, as well as enhancing the community environment within cities and unincorporated areas.The West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce currently is involved in numerous activities including: monitoring local, State, and Federal legislative issues of specific interest to business; maintaining a proactive status to improve transportation facilities and services; publishing an annual ``Buyer's Guide and Membership Directory'' which is distributed to 50,000 residents; soliciting of new businesses and residents to the area; acts as a clearinghouse for information for prospective new businesses; and offers its members opportunities for networking, advertising, education, and referrals.Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in congratulating the membership of the West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce on this occasion.

2355,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Shepard Accelerated School in my district for being named a national Blue Ribbon School recipient.The Blue Ribbon Schools Program identifies and gives national recognition to a diverse group of public and private schools that are unusually effective in meeting local, State, and national goals and in educating all of their students. The program seeks to promote school improvement nationwide through the collaborative self-evaluation required of local school communities that participate. In addition, recognized schools serve as models for other schools and communities seeking to provide high quality education for all their students.Shepard Accelerated School was one of only 264 schools across the United States recognized as a Blue Ribbon School. Now, you might think that sounds like a lot of schools. But think about this--there are about 76,000 public and private elementary and middle schools in America. That means that one out of every 288 elementary and middle schools in the entire United States has been named a Blue Ribbon School for 1997. And I'm pleased that Shepard Accelerated School right here in St. Louis, MO, is one of those schools.To qualify for this award, I know Shepard went through rigorous reviews by some of the Nation's leading educators. The school impressed everybody and they deserve the highest praise for that. The innovative programs and supportive community Shepard has established truly demonstrate the importance of a positive learning environment.Shepard Accelerated School has a shared purpose among faculty, students, and parents to improve the education of the 600 children who attend. I am proud of Shepard for being named a national Blue Ribbon School recipient. Ms. Savannah Young, all the teachers, and especially the students should be saluted for their dedication to high standards and excellence in teaching and learning.Congratulations Shepard Accelerated School.,2015-03-17 19:09:45.588953,2015-03-17 19:09:45.588953,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE SHEPARD ACCELERATED SCHOOL,1997-06-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-17/html/CREC-1997-06-17-pt1-PgE1229.htm,84,0,143,E1229,G000132,mr. gephardt
2356,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his having made it possible for me to stand and speak in favor of this very important opportunity to demonstrate what can happen when we offer individuals the chance to have competition, or the chance to have an influence on where our children are educated.It is one of the agreed upon successes of the United States of America that our university and college system is second to none. Students from all over the world stream into American colleges and universities, and they come here in spite of the fact that they test very, very well in elementary and secondary systems in their own lands. They come here because there is something special about the collegiate and university level in the United States.If I were asked why our collegiate system is tops, I would say, in my judgment, that it is because it is a pluralistic system; that it is diverse. There is no singularity with it. No one is scheduled to go to one school or another. Rather, people have an opportunity to make a selection. And students compete to get into the best schools and the best schools compete for faculty. There is lots of competition in the system. It drives the system forward. It provides a basis for not only education and learning on the part of students but it really develops the energy which provides the basis for research which is expanding the frontiers of knowledge all the time.This concept of diversity, this concept of pluralism, this concept of not being forced to be in one setting, this concept of the energy and creativity, spontaneity and quality that comes when an institution knows it has to do its best for its students because those students aren't forced to go there. They are not locked in. They have the opportunity to be involved in educational experiences elsewhere. That is what drives quality. It is what has carried American higher education to the very top of the educational mountain. There is no dispute. There is no challenger. Second place isn't even close. The United States of America is the clear dominant force in higher education because we are pluralistic, because we are diverse, and no one has a monopoly.On the contrary, if you are a student and you have one choice and one choice alone, the word ``one'' and the word ``choice'' Is an oxymoron; that phrase together. One choice isn't a choice. It is a direction. Students that are locked into a single school don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere. They don't have the capacity to say if you do not shape this place up, I will go elsewhere. They don't have the capacity to energize the system. A parent doesn't have the ability to go into the school and say you must do better. The school says we are the only school. You have one choice. One choice is no choice.What we are really offering to individuals who have been locked into a school system which has failed--I think it is time for us to confess, the school system in Washington, DC, is a failure--is a plan to help energize this school system. It will help the public sector. It will help the private sector. But, most importantly, it will help students and parents.When I had the privilege of being the Governor of my State, I was chairman of the Education Commission of the States. I followed in that responsibility one William Jefferson Clinton, who presided over the Education Commission of the States 1 year; I the next. And one of the things that became apparent in studies conducted from sea to shining sea in this country is that the single most important thing about a student's performance is whether the parents are involved in the education process. How do you get parents involved? You make them meaningful. How can you make parents meaningful in Washington, DC? You can give them the opportunity together with the student to make a choice to go to a school where their needs can be met instead of locking them into a situation where their needs aren't being met and have not been met. And it is a demonstrated fact--the studies tell it, the audits tell it, the school facilities tell it--that the needs aren't being met.Unfortunately, our Secretary of Education has come out to oppose this program providing scholarships so that students could move from one school to another and get good training somewhere if they are not getting it where they are. And he indicated he was opposing it because he felt like it was reducing the funding.Let me just repeat. This particular measure reduces funding not 1 cent. It adds funding to just introduce the concept of scholarships and to put into the hands of parents and students the ability to say we will go where our needs are met. Will this help the District of Columbia schools? It definitely will because they will understand they are no longer the exclusive provider of whatever it is they want to provide. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what it is that students need. Will it help the students? Obviously, it will help the students. It will get their parents involved. It will get them involved. It will meet their needs. And we will establish a model here in the District of Columbia, in the Nation's Capital, which in my judgment would well serve the entire country.It is true that pluralism and diversity are the strength of this great land. They have carried our collegiate system and our research universities to the very top in education around the globe. It would be no accident if we were to allow this to happen at the elementary and secondary level. And it could happen if we were to simply embrace the opportunity of letting parents make meaningful choices. One choice is an oxymoron. One choice is no choice at all. It is a trap. It is time to free students and parents to have an opportunity to select schools that can meet their needs and do so without impairing the financial viability and capacity of the District of Columbia school system in the process.Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:09:45.722041,2015-03-17 19:09:45.722041,Senate,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-25/html/CREC-1997-09-25-pt1-PgS9925-3.htm,130,16,143,S9925-S9940,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2357,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of NFL's finest defensive players and one of Kansas City's finest citizens, Neil Smith of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mr. Smith is in Washington today to accept a prestigious award from the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce [JAYCEES] which has selected Neil Smith as a member of the Congress of Ten Outstanding Young Americans.Neil Smith spent his childhood struggling in school with a learning disability. He was in junior high school before the education system acknowledged his special challenges and helped him discover ways in which he could learn and succeed. Neil Smith will never forget the cruel labels placed on children with dyslexia. That is why today he dedicates time and energy to help youngsters living with learning disabilities.As a former educator, I personally appreciate Mr. Smith's selfless efforts to heighten public awareness and find solutions for individuals with disabilities. He is the national spokesperson for Foundation for Exceptional Children's ``Yes I Can'' Program which encourages disabled children to reach their goals and recognizes their many achievements. He recently partnered with the Learning Disabilities Association of Missouri to fund and produce a public service announcement aimed at dispelling the misconception that children with learning disabilities are ``dumb'' or ``slow''. He says they just need to be shown things in a different way.Neil Smith's efforts remind the Congress that these youth need the support of an education system that works for them, not against them. All children have dreams and each and every one of them deserves the opportunity to achieve those dreams just as Neil Smith has. In Mr. Smith's words, ``People with learning disabilities are not unfortunate. The unfortunate people are quarterbacks.'' Thank you, Neil, for your dedication to our children and your inspiring energy both on and off the field.,2015-03-17 19:09:45.854140,2015-03-17 19:09:45.854140,Extensions,NEIL SMITH, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HONORED,1996-03-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-14/html/CREC-1996-03-14-pt1-PgE357-3.htm,35,0,142,E357,M000316,ms. mccarthy

She made her first vows in March, 1936, and in August of the same year was assigned to teach business education, English, and religion classes at St. Mary's High School in Independence, MO. Following teaching assignments at Glennon High School, Kansas City, and the College of St. Mary's in Omaha, NE, Sister Mary Benita was once again assigned to St. Mary's, Independence.After completing 40 years of teaching, Sister Mary Benita became active in St. Mary's Parish Council where she served as parish ministries coordinator. As director of social ministries for the parish, she coordinated St. Vincent de Paul's outreach to the poor, the Legion of Mary's evangelization efforts, youth service activities, the Over 50 Club and Marian ministry. She continues her ministry to the hospitalized and homebound.Sister Mary Benita has been an active member of the Neighborhood Council, a board member on Meals on Wheels, has participated in neighborhood education programs and has held a continued interest in St. Mary's High School Alumni activities.Currently, Sister Mary is sponsoring faith development groups and is the librarian for the parish library. It is an honor to congratulate Sister Mary Benita on her long-lasting faithfulness to the Church and the Independence community.

2359,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the Advanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri.Back in 1997, several community and state leaders approached me regarding funding for the Advanced Technical Center, which at that time existed only on paper and in the minds of these leaders. I immediately had a certain affection for this project. First and foremost, this project would be located in my hometown of Mexico, Missouri. Second, the local leaders came to me with one of the most comprehensive partnerships that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. The partners included Linn State Technical College, the University of Missouri, Moberly Area Community College, the Mexico Area Vocational and Technical School, the City of Mexico, and the State of Missouri. Third, the Advanced Technical Center would provide students with exceptional educational opportunities through highly specialized and advanced technical education and training at the certificate and degree levels in both emerging and traditional technologies.In the fall of 1997, the Senate approved and the President signed the appropriation bill providing $1 million in Federal funds for the Advanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri. The federal support recognized that the key to staying competitive in today's global marketplace is investing in education and training of our current and future workers. The federal funds, in conjunction with the local and state funds, made this project a reality.This Friday, June 18, 1999, the Advanced Technical Center will celebrate its Grand Opening. I am looking forward to being a part of the celebration. But, more importantly, I am proud to have been a participant in the successful partnership that has led to the creation of a model, state-of-the-art technical training and learning facility in my hometown of Mexico, MO. ,2015-03-17 19:09:46.199381,2015-03-17 19:09:46.199381,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,1999-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-06-15/html/CREC-1999-06-15-pt1-PgS7033-3.htm,84,0,145,S7033-S7034,B000611,mr. bond
2360,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I rise today in strong support of the bipartisan amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii, and others, to reauthorize the Women's Educational Equity Act and to reaffirm the commitment of this House to the principle of gender equity. The amendment enables States and schools to eliminate the historic gender bias in education materials through teacher training and will encourage the participation of girls and minorities in high-tech careers.Madam Chairman, I was a high school English teacher 25 years ago, when Congress made a commitment to encourage women to pursue quality educational opportunities. Congress authorized and appropriated funds to teach teachers how to break the cycles of sexism and gender bias. I can remember discussing with my high school students the possibility of a woman in space, and that conversation was met with general scoffing by the boys in the class and doubt by the girls in the class. But I had the honor, along with a number of women in this Congress to watch the first woman be commander of a NASA spaceship. This year, Eileen Collins proved this effort has made a difference.For 25 years, Congress has reaffirmed its commitment. We have stood by the teachers and the young women, and we have begun to see real results. Test scores are improving; women are staying in school longer; and career choices are slowly expanding. The glass ceiling has not been shattered but it is moving, Madam Chairman. Sixty-five percent of all jobs in the year 2010 will require some technology skills. Do not let that ceiling come crashing back down on the young women of today.Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Mink amendment for education equity.,2015-03-17 19:09:46.345484,2015-03-17 19:09:46.345484,House,STUDENT RESULTS ACT OF 1999,1999-10-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-20/html/CREC-1999-10-20-pt1-PgH10423-2.htm,143,60,145,H10423-H10514,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2361,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, this motion asks that we recommit this bill for the purpose of addressing the real education priorities of parents, of teachers, and of local communities. It calls for the House to scrap this ill-conceived and this misguided bill and pass legislation to reduce class sizes in the early grades, to repair crumbling and overcrowded schools, and to ensure all teachers are fully qualified.Rather than gutting the hard work we accomplished today by passing increased accountability and targeting of funds to poor schools, we can build on H.R. 2 by addressing the priorities in this motion. Reducing class size is one of the most important investments we can make to improve student achievement.Last year we made a down payment to hire 100,000 new teachers by passing the Clinton/Clay Class Size Reduction Act. Too many of our schools have 30 or more children pressed desk-to-desk in classrooms. This is unacceptable. We all know and studies confirm that children learn better in small early classes.Today, over one-third of our public schools are dilapidated and in need of replacement or major modernization. For years Democrats have been demanding action on this urgent education priority, but the majority continues to block action.It is a national shame, Mr. Speaker, that one of the most hallowed institutions in our Nation, the public schoolhouse, has been allowed to fall into such disrepair. We think our children deserve the right to attend schools in a safe, well-maintained building that is capable of using modern educational technology.The Rangel school modernization bill helps communities address this urgent priority by allowing the issuance of interest-free bonds. We should act now to pass the Rangel school construction bill.Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this motion to recommit.,2015-03-17 19:09:46.490595,2015-03-17 19:09:46.490595,House,ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL ACT (STRAIGHT A's ACT),1999-10-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-21/html/CREC-1999-10-21-pt1-PgH10685-3.htm,144,125,145,H10685-H10715,C000488,mr. clay
2362,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Diane Watson of Saint Joseph, Missouri. Diane is active in the community and has been chosen to receive the YWCA Women of Excellence Award for Woman in Volunteerism.Diane's recent retirement from the St. Joseph School District Board of Education ended more than 40 years of total service to the public school system as a teacher and volunteer, including 12 consecutive years as a Board Member. During her first term on the board, she helped lead a $36 million bond project for school improvement. In her later term, she helped with the establishment of personal computers for students. Diane's volunteer career extends across the community, including roles as a docent at the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art; Chapter and Reciprocity President of P.E.O.; and an elder, deacon and committee member to the First Presbyterian Church. As Area Coordinator for Phi Delta Kappa, she traveled the western part of Missouri encouraging quality education. She has also contributed her time and talents to the Calla Varner Board, the Junior League, the Flower Society, the St. Joseph Symphony, and the Performing Arts Association, among others. With an enthusiastic personality and a ``can-do'' attitude, Diane Watson has become an outstanding community volunteer and an admired friend to many--all of which she humbly attributes to ``going wherever the Lord leads.''Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Diane Watson. She has made an amazing impact on countless individuals in the St. Joseph community. I am honored to represent her in the United States Congress.,2015-03-17 19:09:46.644725,2015-03-17 19:09:46.644725,Extensions,DIANE WATSON,2012-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-06-18/html/CREC-2012-06-18-pt1-PgE1053-4.htm,92,0,158,E1053,G000546,mr. graves of missouri
2363,MO,Billy,Long,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Melanie Ward.Melanie was recently chosen as a member of the U.S. Army All-American Marching Band, a national honor ensemble for outstanding musician-scholars.Each year, only 125 students are chosen from the thousands who apply to the Army All-American Marching Band. Only students with superior musical ability, academic achievement, and positive standing in the community are selected to represent their school in this elite group. Students are selected by the National Association for Music Education to represent their state and local communities at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas.Melanie was selected for one of twenty positions reserved for the band's color guard and she certainly fits the mold for this elite group. She is the editor of the Parkview High School yearbook, an award winning cross country runner and captain of the school band's color guard.The marching band members will perform for thousands of active duty military members at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in January. The U.S. Army All-American Bowl is a football game made up of the best high school seniors from around the country. Together, the marching band and football team represent the best their schools have to offer in the arts and physical education.Mr. Speaker, Melanie's hard work and determination in both academics and music have earned her a spot on the U.S. Army All-American Marching Band. I am proud of her achievements and honored to call her a neighbor in the 7th Congressional District of Missouri.,2015-03-17 19:09:46.799814,2015-03-17 19:09:46.799814,Extensions,RECOGNIZING MELANIE WARD,2012-10-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-10-30/html/CREC-2012-10-30-pt1-PgE1729-3.htm,140,0,158,E1729,L000576,mr. long
2364,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, last year, Democrats and Republicans joined together with President Bush to enact a monumental and far-reaching education bill.This new law, the Leave No Child Behind Act, will bring new resources and meaningful reform to our Nation's schools.It establishes new academic standards for students, increases teacher training, and demands new levels of accountability, while increasing flexibility with Federal funds at the State and local level.I am hopeful that this law will help close the achievement gaps that separate many poor and minority students from their peers.Indeed, I am optimistic that it will improve education for all students.But Congress has, as Harry Truman once said, some ``unfinished business' when it comes to our schools.We have left out a critical component when it comes to ensuring that our schools and our teachers and, most importantly, our students will succeed.Today, one in five schools fails to meet building or safety codes or needs extensive repairs, renovations, and maintenance.Across the country, run-down, overcrowded, dilapidated schools jeopardize the health and safety of our students.Across the country, deteriorating schools inhibit the ability of our children to learn.And yet, with the exception of the Impact Aid program, which I strongly support, the new education reform law did not include funds for school renovation and repair.Nor were any funds for renovation and repair made available through the appropriations process.The administration's most recent budget even eliminates the Emergency School Repair Program.And yet, data from the National Center for Education Statistics tells us that nearly $127 billion in renovations and repairs are needed to upgrade existing schools to good physical condition.Furthermore, this figure does not include the funding needed for construction to accommodate increasing enrollments in districts across the country.We have these pressing needs at a time when resources are scarce. Our States and local governments are still feeling the effects of the recession.And for too many years, Congress has failed to provide States and localities the funding it promised long ago to share the cost of special education.The Federal Government cannot ask States and localities to shoulder the burden of school renovation and repair costs alone.If the Federal Government stands on the sidelines, it will be at the expense of our children.But neither should Washington attempt to single-handedly solve this problem. Congress should not be in the business of giving direct grants to communities to build schools.I strongly believe that education is a national priority but a local responsibility.The legislation being introduced today, the ``Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act,'' answers this call for partnership.Our bill provides initial funding for the creation of State and regional infrastructure banks. These banks will make loans to districts for school construction or modernization needs.This mechanism helps to alleviate the financial burden for States and localities but provides sufficient flexibility to meet local needs.The structure of the bill ensures that states and localities have the requisite flexibility to tailor programs to meet their unique needs.The bill requires a 25 percent State match, which ensures the commitment of State government to the program while allowing States to leverage their dollars four-to-one.It is a voluntary program--only for those states who choose to participate.To those who have argued that the Federal Government should have no role in school facilities, and likewise to those who call for overly intrusive Federal programs, this bill offers a common-sense compromise.I remember visiting a school in Nixa, MO, where every fourth-grader in the district attends class in trailers behind the school.I have subsequently learned from teachers and administrators in other districts that the kids in trailers often have the best deal because conditions in the actual school buildings are often far worse than they are in the trailers.Every State in this country has districts in need, in both urban and rural and suburban communities. The needs span the social economic strata of our Nation.Disadvantaged and minority students are most likely to attend school in decrepit and obsolete buildings.I would imagine that we have all seen schools that are either freezing cold or unbearably hot, that have poor lighting or inadequate bathroom facilities.But students in more affluent suburbs--where there is often explosive growth in the community--also suffer from overcrowding.Most parents would agree that they would like their children to attend schools where the student to teacher ratio is low, where class size is small.Yet, without enough space, small class size is an impossibility.And despite these conditions, we are asking our children for more than ever before.A fellow Missourian, Mark Twain, once told the following story:When I was a boy on the Mississippi River there was a proposition in a township there to discontinue public schools because they were too expensive. An old farmer spoke up and said, ``If they stopped building the schools they would not save anything, because every time a school was closed a jail had to be built.''I have great faith in America's children. The time to invest in them is now. The investments we make in them will be returned to us many times over.,2015-03-17 19:09:46.943914,2015-03-17 19:09:46.943914,Senate,LEAVE NO CHILD BEHIND ACT,2002-04-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-18/html/CREC-2002-04-18-pt1-PgS2910-2.htm,44,0,148,S2910-S2911,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2365,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Madam President, all across our Nation, local schools are trying to ensure that tragedies like the one in Littleton do not happen again.The Federal Government in Washington is not in a position to make the best decisions for those local schools. No government--let alone the Federal Government--can produce a single solution, to prevent school violence.The problems have deeper roots in our culture. Nonetheless, there are some important steps we can take to help local school districts and parents make schools safer.In a few moments, I will send to the desk an amendment on behalf of Members of the Youth Violence Education task force, a task force which I helped Chair, that will help ensure that our schools once again become safe havens, rather than places of jeopardy. I thank those who came together on this task force to contribute to the amendment. Specifically, Senators Hutchinson, DeWine, Gregg, Helms, Coverdell, Allard, and Abraham.This package is comprehensive in that it contains numerous provisions that give tools to schools and communities to prevent youth violence. First and foremost, we need to put local schools at the top of our agenda and free them to use Federal money where it will do the most good to prevent future violence. Time and experience have exposed as an utter falsehood the notion that we know what is best in every educational setting.One-size-fits-all regulations won't help local schools reduce their particular risks or solve their unique problems. As we provide resources, we need to provide freedom.The cornerstone of our education amendment would open up existing Department of Education funds to allow school districts new options for putting Federal dollars to work. Under this amendment, schools can choose where best to spend Federal resources under titles IV and VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--specifically, the Safe and Drug Free Schools program, and Innovative Educational Program Strategies funds.Schools can decide whether to spend the money on training, equipment, school assessments, or more personnel. For example, under this amendment, local school districts could use Federal money for purchasing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, for training school officials in recognizing and averting potentially dangerous situations, or for introducing school uniform policies, if they so chose.Local school districts would remain free to choose the use that best addresses local needs. The Federal Government provides a great deal of money for education and related funding. The fiscal year 2000 budget resolution conference report called for $66.3 billion in education and related funding for fiscal year 2000; $404.1 billion over 5 years; and $782.4 billion over 10 years.Compared to current spending levels, this represents an increase of $8.1 billion over 5 years and $33 billion over 10 years.As a result of this budget resolution, Congress will be providing much-needed funding to education programs in fiscal year 2000. While we know that local schools need our help, we do not always know how best to provide that help. We need to provide the opportunity and authority for local schools to do what they can to improve the climate for safe and secure learning environments on campuses. For this reason, this amendment will give schools the flexibility they need to best provide for the safety and security of their students.Another component of this amendment would clarify that nothing in the Federal law stands in the way of local decisions to introduce a dress code or school uniform policy--not to mandate from Washington, but make it clear that the Federal law does not prevent it or preclude it. To make sure that we don't constrain efforts to build working communities, this legislation makes it abundantly clear that Federal law does not prohibit schools from instituting dress codes. Dress codes can create a sense of belonging and unity among students and help eliminate the division of schools according to cliques. By doing so, dress codes can help schools have a sense of community among students, and Federal law should not block local educators from fostering this sense of community.In Kansas City, MO, the George Washington Carver Elementary School, a magnet school, established a dress code policy for the 320 elementary school students in 1990. The results are positive. Philomina Harshaw, the principal for all 6 years that Carver has had uniforms, observed that a new sense of calmness exists throughout the school after students began wearing uniforms. ``The students feel good about themselves, as uniforms build a sense of pride,'' she has reported.Long Beach, CA, has a school uniform in all its elementary and middle schools. District officials found in the year following the implementation of the school uniform policy, overall school crime decreased 36 percent, fights decreased 51 percent, sex offenses decreased 74 percent, weapons offenses decreased 50 percent, assault and battery offenses decreased 34 percent, and vandalism decreased 18 percent, sending a clear message that some of the resources which can be used to implement such a policy is sending a clear message of freedom to our schools that they are free to act in the best interests of their students.The federal government should be in a position to assist schools in making decisions that they believe can make a difference, particularly when the record is clear about the difference made in other districts.In addition, this task force, which was formed to look at our federal education policy to see if anything could be done to reduce the impact of violence in schools, included in the amendment a provision which provides certain liability protections for school personnel when they undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline, and a safe educational environment.This provision, to which Senator Coverdell will speak shortly, is based upon similar liability protections for volunteers that was signed into law, as well as a number of state laws that offer teachers limited civil liability against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits. We must assure that teachers and other school personnel are able to do what is necessary to provide a safe and stable learning environment for all students.This amendment also includes language that makes certain that school discipline records follow a student when a student transfers to another public or private school.The receiving school should have information about the discipline records of a student coming into that school environment. In the last Congress I sponsored an amendment that ensured that juvenile records were available to schools when students transferred.My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of 15-year-old Christine Smetzer in a restroom at McCluer North High School in St. Louis County. The male special education student convicted of murdering Smetzer had a juvenile record and had been caught in the women's restroom at a previous school. However, teachers and administrators at McCluer North say they were not informed of the student's record when he transferred to their school.It was tragic the transfer didn't involve the disciplinary records, because it cost Christine Smetzer her life.In response, I secured a provision in the law requiring that, under IDEA, student disciplinary records must transfer to a new school when the student goes to a new school.The language in the task force amendment expands that provision, so that any student's discipline record--whether or not the student is served under IDEA--will be available to any school--public or private--to which the student transfers.We need to send all the information we can about a student to a new school when a person transfers.These provisions and others were developed by the Republican Education Task Force which I chaired. I want to again thank my colleagues who worked with me on the Task Force--Senators DeWine and Hutchinson, Gregg, Coverdell, and Helms. I look forward to working with them to ensure that these proposals are included in the final bill.It is in response to these considerations. As a result of the work product of this task force, we developed a package of considerations in an amendment.I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.,2015-03-17 19:09:47.167067,2015-03-17 19:09:47.167067,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-17/html/CREC-1999-05-17-pt1-PgS5394-3.htm,71,193,145,S5394-S5416,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2366,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support to Absentee Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voters Act of 2001. This bill ensures that Americans serving overseas, be they the men and women of the military who stand guard on foreign shares, or equally deserving citizens who serve our country in other venues, will have their vote counted. American citizens should not loose their right to vote under arbitrary or unfair standards. It is therefore incumbent upon lawmakers to ensure their rights are protected.Although overseas mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark, the reality of the situation is that circumstances in foreign countries, or at sea aboard u.S. Navy ships, can result in mail being sent without a postmark. Currently several states require a postmark for an absentee ballot to be counted and without such a postmark citizens are denied their vote through absolutely no fault of their own. We saw the damaging affects of this standard in our most recent Presidential election.My bill provides that states may not refuse to count a ballot submitted in an election for a Federal office by an absentee uniformed services member or overseas citizen voter on the grounds that the ballot was improperly or fraudulently cast ``unless the State finds clear and convincing evidence'' of fraud in the preparation or casting of the ballot by the voter. Specifically, the bill states under a ``Clear and Convincing Evidence'' standard, the lack of a witness signature, address, postmark, or other identifying information may not be considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud, absent any other information or evidence. Consequently the mere absence of a postmark will not disqualify an overseas citizen from casting his or her vote. By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dodd):S. 471. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for the renovation of schools; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, today we will be introducing the Public School Repair and Renovation Act. This legislation will provide grants to local schools so they can make the repairs to ensure the safety of their students. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bingaman, Kennedy, Wellsone, Dodd, and Clinton on this legislation.In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a Report Card for America's Infrastructure which reported serious problems with the physical infrastructure in our nation. However, the most alarming finding is the failing grade to schools in the United States--the only area to receive a failing grade.It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our kids see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown place they see is their school. What signal are we sending them about the value we place on them, their education and future?Modernizing and repairing our nation's schools is something I've been advocating for over a decade now. I secured $100 million in the fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill as a down payment on a school modernization program and was disappointed when those funds were rescinded.But we made real progress last year with the passage of a $1.2 billion initiative to make emergency repairs. That was a bipartisan agreement hammered out by Senator Specter and me in negotiations on the fiscal year 2001 appropriations bill with Congressman Goodling and the White House.This was a 1 year authorization and the School Repair and Renovation Act will reauthorize this bipartisan plan for 5 years. This program provides grants to Local Education Agencies to help them make urgently needed repairs and to pay for special education and construction related technology expenses.Funds will be distributed to the States. States will then distribute 75 percent of the funds on a competitive basis to local school districts to make emergency repairs such as fixing fire code violation, repairing the roof or installing new plumbing. The remaining 25 percent will be distributed competitively to local school districts to use for technology activities related to school renovation or for activities authorized under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.The School Repair and Renovation Act is a key component in a two-prong strategy to modernize our nation's schools.In the near future I will join forces with Representatives Johnson and Rangel and introduce the America's Better Classrooms Act in the Senate to provide tax credits for school construction projects. This bipartisan legislation would leverage $1.7 billion in tax credits over 5 years to pay the interest on $25 billion in school modernization bonds.I know this approach will work because it mirrors a successful school construction demonstration program I started in Iowa in 1997. The Iowa demonstration is a two-prong response to our school modernization needs. First, we provide grants to local school districts to make urgent repairs to remedy fire code violations. Second, grants are made to local school districts to subsidize a portion of the cost for a new construction project.The program has been a big success. During the first 2 years of the demonstration, federal funds of $14.7 million supported projects totaling $142 million--each federal dollar leveraged $10.33.There is a legitimate federal role in helping fix our nation's crumbling schools, and we can do so without undermining local control of education. This federal role is recognized by President Bush who is recommending an expanded use of private activity bonds for school construction projects.Over the past few years we have had several partisan skirmishes related to school construction. This is a new year, a new Congress, and a new administration. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the School Repair and Renovation Act of 2001. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the report card to which I referred be printed in the Record.There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:TrillionA = ExceptionB = GoodC = MediocreD = PoorF = IndequateEach category was evaluated on the basis of condition and performance,capacity vs. need, and funding vs. need.,2015-03-17 19:09:47.323185,2015-03-17 19:09:47.323185,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2001-03-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-06/html/CREC-2001-03-06-pt1-PgS1898.htm,28,17,147,S1898-S1910,B000611,mr. bond
2367,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank the acting manager. I thank the Chair.I want to talk about an amendment that I introduced some time ago and which we will vote on later this afternoon. The amendment itself is not very difficult and not very complex. It doesn't have a major change. But it represents a watershed development in education. Parents for a long time have marveled at how fast their children learn when they are very young and how they pick up things--not just things off the floor but how they learn language and how they learn many other things.Research has verified what all of us have known instinctively for a long time--that the first years of life are absolutely crucial in the development of a child's intelligence, habits, and the entire approach to life. The early years have a significant bearing on development and especially on the learning of each child. Infant brain development occurs very rapidly. The sensations and experiences of this time go a very long way towards shaping the baby's mind in a way that has a long-lasting impact on all aspects of the child's life.You can think, if you have been a parent, or if you are parents, about how fast they learn in the first 3 years. A baby learns to walk, to talk, and to interact with others.As a matter of fact, an astounding figure I heard was that half a child's mature intelligence is developed by 3 years of age. During those first 3 years that a child learns, it absorbs so much that it is half of what he or she is going to know for the rest of their life.The early months of growth, understanding, reasoning, and learning can never be brought back or redone again. Once they are gone, they are gone. The early years of a child's development are not just rehearsal. That is the whole show. That is the opening act. That sets the stage and the pace of their entire life's path.Parents and families are key to the early development of a child. Through the amendment that I offer today, we seek to focus on support of parents and family education for young children.This amendment provides a clarification to title VI, part A of the substitute. It simply states that early childhood and early childhood parent education are eligible for funding and that early childhood means zero, or birth, to 5 years of age. The amendment is no new money, and it doesn't authorize any new program.People think learning begins at kindergarten. By kindergarten children are halfway through their learning process in their entire life. Who best to teach that child in the first 3 formative years than the parents? We must focus on the early years of a child's life as well as on the years of formal schooling. We can emphasize and champion this early involvement.My amendment proposes to do just that by supporting successful early childhood programs and initiatives that are working at local and State levels throughout this country.We spend so much time talking about how to improve our public schools, which we must do, and this bill attempts to do that. We talk about improving school performance for students, reducing violence in schools, and all of that we must do. But I think we can reduce the amount of time we spend trying to fix, repair, and cure these problems if we get the job done right at the first stage.A key to this successful prevention is parental involvement at the time most essential in the child's development. The organization, which in my State of Missouri has been doing an outstanding job--and it is being done nationwide--is something called Parents as Teachers. I will refer to it as PAT.It is an early childhood education program and family support program designed to empower all parents, regardless of their income levels, to give their child the best possible start in life. PAT is now in all 50 States and 6 foreign countries.My involvement with Parents as Teachers began in 1979. Then commissioner of elementary and secondary education, Arthur Mallory, who worked for me the previous term when I had been Governor, came to talk to me about a very interesting and challenging program they had begun based on the work of some of the researchers and scholars who had looked at the Head Start Program. He said they were finding out that what a parent does in those first 3 years was vitally important as they stimulate the child's learning intelligence. Curiosity is the basis of it. That was 1979.I started talking about that and ran a successful campaign for Governor in 1980. In 1981, our first son was born. You talk about an old dog trying to learn new tricks. I had just bought a new car, and they gave me a manual about that thick of what to do with the new car. We came home from the hospital with a new baby. They gave us a supply of diapers and told us to be sure to use a child's seat. I said that is a little bit mistaken as to the emphasis we ought to put on preparing children and making sure that parents are ready for the challenge of raising a child.We had, fortunately, access to many initiatives that had been developed in this program, The program was not statewide at the time. It was, in fact, in the initial stages. The scholars, including Dr. Burton White, had written several thoughtful books. We read those books. We learned from them what was supposed to be happening. The interesting thing was it made it a lot easier for us to work with our son to understand what he was doing.I recommended it to the Missouri General Assembly. They did not pass it in 1981. They didn't pass it in 1982. They did not pass it in 1983. But being stubborn, I came back in 1984, and we pointed out to them that this not only prepared the child for learning--my director of corrections came before the committee giving testimony on the bill and said this was the most important thing we could do for the long-term future of our State: reduce the population of our corrections system by getting parents involved and making sure that children were off to a good learning start; making sure that parents were responsible for their children.In 1982, I set up something called the Children's Trust Fund Commission to help reduce child abuse. We had 25 eminent children's leaders from the ministry, education, and health around the State who studied how to prevent child abuse. They came back in 1984 with the unanimous recommendation to adopt Parents as Teachers to help the families know how to deal with the challenges of raising a child.I have always had a theory that if you have a toddler in your house, at some point if that toddler doesn't drive you absolutely nuts, either, A, the toddler is not normal, or, B, you are not normal. Parents as Teachers can teach how you can constructively use that curiosity, that enthusiasm, and that burgeoning intelligence and shift it in the right direction.Fortunately, after a bit of cajoling, a little wheeling and dealing, and a few side deals that I will not mention here, the Missouri General Assembly adopted Parents as Teaches as the statewide program in 1984.It has gone statewide. Each year it is a voluntary participation program, available in all 500-plus school districts in Missouri. And 150,000 families, with 200,000 children, participate in the program. Now the program is working throughout the country. The State of Tennessee has 20 program sites, Massachusetts has 7 program sites, Nevada has 13 program sites, Mississippi has 32 program sites, South Dakota has 20 Parents as Teachers Program sites; our neighbors in Kansas have 222 program sites; Illinois has 132 program sites.As I said, PAT is a voluntary participation program. It is tailored to empower parents to know how to deal constructively with their children. Sometimes it is included as part of Even Start, another title 1 program. PAT and Head Start in Missouri have a great partnership to ensure that all children get off to a great start.Some said at the beginning, why, this is a good program for people on Medicaid or people on TANF, and other programs. And that is true. But it is a program that works for every family, the so-called ``successful'' family, with two working parents--two professionals, working full time, who never have enough time for their families. But with this program they know how to use that time constructively.As a father, I never looked forward to playing the typical father role, which is where somebody says: If you don't behave, when your father gets home, you're really going to get it. I did not intend to be a father so I could be the one to bring out the hairbrush. There was a paddle when I got home. But Parents as Teachers taught me what I could do constructively to help my child be more curious and begin the learning process.Studies and reports have shown that PAT children at age 3 are significantly more advanced than the comparison children in language, problem solving, and social development. Often, through participation in PAT, learning problems or developmental delays or disabilities are identified and treated early.This is one of the great things. They have screening in the program, and they identify minor hearing defects which can, if not corrected, put a child behind as much as a year by the time that child reaches first grade.I had an eyesight problem when I was little. It wasn't identified until I was in the sixth grade. It was too late to help it then. Each year the program has been in effect, they have identified that eye problem; they have been able to correct it because they identified it before the child reached 2 years of age.Some people, when opposing Parents as Teachers, say it is subversive; that the Government is trying to come in and take over the children. The Government is not trying to come in and take over the children. But there is a subversive element that I have learned; that is, once you teach a parent how to do a better job with the child's learning intelligence, you get that parent hooked on the child's education. A parent goes in thinking: Gee, this will help me control my child. The parent comes out being involved, supporting and participating in the child's education. And most people will tell you that the most important thing a parent can do is to stay involved with the child's education.We all know we can have all the programs in the world and can provide all the funding possible, but one of the main ingredients on which we must focus to assure a child's success in school is parental involvement.Earlier this year I received a copy of a report from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report was entitled ``School Entry Assessment Project.'' Some of the findings really piqued my interest.The findings of the report are as follows:No. 1, when Parents as Teachers is combined with any other prekindergarten experience for high-poverty children, the children score above average on all scales when they enter kindergarten.No. 2, the highest performing children participate in PAT and preschool or center care. Among children who participate in PAT and attend preschool, both minority and nonminority children score above average. Children in both high-poverty and low-poverty schools who participate in PAT and attend preschool score above average when they enter kindergarten.No. 3, among children whose care and education are solely home-based, those whose families participate in PAT score significantly higher.No. 4, special needs children who participate in PAT and preschool, in addition to an early childhood special education program, are rated by teachers as being similar in preparation to the average child.Finally, Head Start children who also participate in PAT and other preschool activities score at average or above when they enter kindergarten.These findings sum it all up. PAT works. PAT works for children raised in households of all income levels. PAT works for children who are homeschooled, children who have special needs.My amendment, which I urge my colleagues to support, makes certain that priority is given to programs such as PAT and other early childhood and parent education programs.I thank the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:09:47.468282,2015-03-17 19:09:47.468282,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT,2001-06-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-06-11/html/CREC-2001-06-11-pt1-PgS6023-2.htm,80,10,147,S6023-S6050,B000611,mr. bond
2368,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, our families are struggling in the worst economy since the Great Depression. It is a difficult time for many who do not have jobs or who have seen their savings shrink or are in danger of losing their homes. We are working very hard on many fronts to try to get the economy going again.During this time, I think it is important we not lose sight of our long-term priorities. We have to build a better safety net for our children and families. We must think about the long-term educational prospects and tools for success our children need, regardless of the economy.Today, I highlight two bills that address educational needs of children.First, research tells us that the first months and years of life are critical in laying the foundation for later success in school and social interaction. As a matter of fact, some people say that half of a child's learning intelligence is developed by 3 years old. For too long, we have thought those wonderful little people under 3 were just to be loved and ignored in terms of education. Much of the time is spent in the home, and parents are the most influential part of a child's life. It is my view that they must be the child's best first teacher. During these early moments, with the parents and other family members, children establish their social, emotional and intellectual health that will continue to grow throughout their lives. Enhancing these early critical moments further enhances the later years of a child's education.You know, the key to education is exciting their curiosity. If you can make a child curious, then you can begin to teach them because you can respond to what their curiosity seeks. I think it makes sense to equip the parents with the skills they need to help maximize the child's health and development. This is exactly what a program that I have worked on in Missouri does. It is called Parents as Teachers--or PAT--and that is precisely what it focuses on. It focuses on primarily those first 3 years of life, when half the learning intelligence, when the socialization and interaction are developing, and when the curiosity is excited.The curriculum of PAT is designed to build a foundation for later learning, to provide early detection of developmental delays, as well as health, vision, and hearing problems, to prevent child abuse and neglect and to increase a child's school readiness and success.Actually, we found that detecting those early childhood developmental delays probably saves more money in avoiding special education or remedial education needs later on. The way we finally got the bill passed in the Missouri General Assembly was when a commission I had set up as Governor studied ways to lessen child abuse. They came back and said: You know, the best thing you can do is to equip a parent with the tools to deal with a child's frustration and keep them from pushing you to the point where you are abusive.My Bond theorem is that if you have a 2-year-old child and that child isn't driving you nuts on a regular basis, either, A, you are not normal or, B, the child is not normal. Parents as Teachers gives the parent a means of dealing with those frustrating and challenging times.Twenty-five years ago, I pushed the Early Childhood Education Act through the Missouri General Assembly and signed it into law. It was my second term and I had to fight for 4 years to get the bill passed, but it mandates that Parents as Teachers be offered in every school district in the State. In other words, to every family; whether they were going to home school their children, whether they had their children at parochial or private school or in a public school.That was 4 long years of work, and I don't know that I have ever had a more satisfying 4-year-long battle with that success. I was on a mission because the year I started pushing it was the year my son was born. I was anxious to be a new father and shared the same feelings of anxiety and confusion many new parents still feel today. I had bought a new car before my son arrived, and it came with a handbook. We took Sam home from the hospital, and they told us to use a car seat and gave us diapers. Well, children's schooling is a key component of a child's success in school, and that is why we began working on it.PAT made a positive difference in my family, through sleepless nights, teething, and learning the ABCs. My son was probably one of the first to benefit from the Parents as Teachers materials and books, but countless others have benefited since. And after I passed it, I found that parents would stop me on the street or in my office and say: You would not believe what I learned when the parent educator came to visit us. Every time it was something new and different and it gave the parents a feeling of power that they could deal with the opportunities this new child gave them.What began as an experiment in Missouri has expanded to more than 3,000 sites in all 50 States and 8 foreign countries. Countries all over the world are investing in PAT because the results are positive and the cost is low. We have about 150,000 Missouri families--200,000 children--participating in PAT now. I have had the anecdotal results, but scientifically we have determined, through sound research, that at age 3, PAT children are more advanced in language, social development, problem solving, and other cognitive abilities than their peers; and parents who participate in PAT are more confident about their parenting and more involved in the children's schooling, which is a key component of a child's success in school.I can tell you also that when you talk to an elementary school educator or administrator they can tell you which children have been in the Parents as Teachers program because it is that obvious from the start. A 2008 published, peer-reviewed study of almost 8,000 Missouri children found that 82 percent of low-income children who participated in both Parents as Teachers and preschool entered kindergarten ready to learn, as compared to only 64 percent of similar children who had no involvement in either service.At third grade, 88 percent of low-income children who participated in both Parents as Teachers and preschool received a benchmark level of performance on the Missouri Assessment Program Communication Arts test, compared to 77 percent of similar children with no involvement.These results confirm what I know from personal experience and have heard from so many parents in PAT--it is a tremendous benefit to them and their children.To date, more than 2 million families nationwide have received the education and support of PAT programs. These are accomplishments of which we can be proud, but we need to do more. There are more families that can and should be reached by this life-changing program, which is why I have introduced the Education Begins at Home Act with Senators Murray and Clinton. This legislation will establish the first dedicated Federal funding stream to support the expansion of PAT.Our bill has had strong bipartisan support in the past, and I expect it will continue. It would authorize $400 million over 3 years to States to expand access to Parents as Teachers. It would provide $50 million over 3 years to fund innovative ideas and partnerships at the local level to expand access to PAT in communities with limited English proficiency, and it would provide $50 million over 3 years to reach more military families by expanding access to PAT in schools and community organizations that serve military families.As a side note, we have established the program at several military facilities in Missouri where one parent is often gone overseas, and the family may not have any normal family network to help them. This brings the parents together and it also provides them some of the resources that they might get from a grandmother or an aunt or even an uncle.Parents as Teachers builds on the principle that babies are born to learn and that the child's parent is the first and most important teacher. PAT gives parents the tools they need to prepare children for success in school and life, and helps parents become more active participants in their child's education. I believe the expansion of Parents as Teachers is a sound investment in the future of our children and our families, and I hope my colleagues will join me in it.I, also, wish to add comments about another extremely important act to ensure the success of children--the Vision Care for Kids Act. Eighty percent of what kids learn in their early years is visual, but one in four children has a vision problem that can interfere with learning, and only one in three children receive any form of preventive vision care before school.As I said, children have tremendous potential to learn and succeed, but untreated vision disorders can lead to permanent vision loss. I know that, personally, because I suffer from a permanent vision loss due to a previously undiagnosed condition which wasn't learned about until it was too late. If the condition had been discovered and treated before I entered school, I could have avoided a lifetime of vision loss--and I might have done a much better job of catching fly balls in the outfield.The Vision Care for Kids Act, which I have reintroduced with Senator Dodd, establishes a grant program to complement and encourage existing State efforts to improve children's vision care. Ensuring good vision for kids will help them see bright futures ahead of them. I invite my colleagues to join us in supporting children and families through these important bills.For the vision care, talk with Senator Dodd or me. For Parents as Teachers, talk with Senator Murray or me. We would love to have you on these two important bills.I thank the Chair and I thank the staff for according me this opportunity.,2015-03-17 19:09:47.610388,2015-03-17 19:09:47.610388,Senate,EDUCATION BEGINS AT HOME ACT,2009-01-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-16/html/CREC-2009-01-16-pt1-PgS647.htm,10,0,155,S647-S648,B000611,mr. bond
2369,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Slaughter-Dicks amendment.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Slaughter-Dicks-Horn-Johnson-Morella amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill to give the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) additional appropriations of $10 million and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) an additional $5 million. The value of the NEA lies in its ability to nurture the growth and artistic excellence of thousands of arts organizations and artists in every corner of the country, making the performing, visual, literary, media and folk arts available to millions of Americans.Even in this time of fiscal restraint and budget deficits, the value of the NEA cannot be overstated. Additional appropriations are still required, as the NEA is a great investment in the economic growth of every community in the country. A recent study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology found that the nonprofit arts industry alone generates $134 billion annually in economic activity, supports 4.85 million full time jobs and returns $10.5 billion to the Federal Government in income taxes. While the economic benefit of the arts industry is integral to our Nation's economy, affording children access to the arts through education yields more significant dividends to our society. The U.S. Department of Justice found that arts education reduced delinquency in San Antonio by 13 percent, increased communication skills of Atlanta students by 57 percent, and improved cooperation skills of Portland youth by 57 percent. In addition, the College Board has shown that college bound students who are involved in the arts have higher overall SAT scores than other students.The National Endowment for the Humanities is the largest single funder of humanities programs in the United States, enriching American intellectual and cultural life through support to museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, state humanities councils, public television and radio, and to individual scholars. A small investment through NEH reaps large rewards, providing seed money for high quality projects and programs that reach millions of Americans each year. This money, and NEH's reputation, leverage millions of dollars in private support for humanities projects. NEH is critical to addressing the Nation's future needs in education. More than two-thirds of our Nation's K-12 curriculum is dedicated to the humanities; 2 million new teachers will be needed in our classrooms over the next decade, and 4 out of 5 teachers feel inadequately prepared in their subject area. NEH summer seminars and institutes address these very issues, and are the catalyst for revitalized teachers for tens of thousands of students each year.America's creative industries are our Nation's leading export with over $60 billion annually in overseas sales, including the output of artists and other creative workers in publishing, audiovisual, music and recording and entertainment businesses.The National Endowment for the Humanities plays an important role in the American arts enterprise. NEH grants provide critical funding for work in art history, theory and criticism, including: university based and independent research projects; professional development seminars for K-12 and college teachers; film and radio programs; museum exhibitions and exhibition catalogs; and material culture preservation.In my home state of Missouri, our Humanities Council currently is planning an array of public programs for distribution in Missouri during the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition, 2003 through 2006. The planning is supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Missouri Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission. The NEH planning grant supporting these trial programs is intended to produce program templates that can be deployed successfully with local participation by Native American spokespersons in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, serving communities within a day-trip's distance of the Missouri River. These programs will provide Missouri youth an important lesson in American history in an entertaining environment.Mr. Chairman, I commend all arts advocates today on their continued dedication to arts in education. I strongly urge for increased resources for arts education in this year's appropriations process.,2015-03-17 19:09:47.777508,2015-03-17 19:09:47.777508,House,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2003,2002-07-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-07-17/html/CREC-2002-07-17-pt1-PgH4773-3.htm,97,214,148,H4773-H4819,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2370,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,In addition, and that is so critically important, what a popular idea that is in place in your State and in other States as far as prepaid State tuition plans, to be used again as a tool focusing on higher education.Here are a couple of other perhaps noncontroversial measures in H.R. 7 that I think deserve some mention in addition to the prepaid tuition plans, ending that taxation on both public and private plans. We also help those that are saddled with heavy student loans. How many of us in this body perhaps have used student loans to invest in ourselves in education to maybe go on to higher education or to postgraduate studies. What we do to try to give some relief to those under that heavy burden of student loans is that we continue, we expand the student deduction, the loan interest deduction under current law, we expand that, allow more time for that deduction to be made possible.In addition, there is a lot of discussion about school construction. Interestingly as we debated this bill in our committee, in the Committee on Ways and Means last week, we had a representative from the U.S. Treasury, obviously from the administration, and I pointed out in a document that was printed in 1996 that the statement of the administration was they believed the construction of schools is a local initiative. Yet I guess over the course of the last couple of years, we have suddenly changed or at least the White House has changed into thinking that suddenly school construction and modernization should be a Federal initiative. Without getting into the merits of whether it is a State, and I happen to think it is a State and local initiative, in fact in my home county, Boone County, Missouri in the Ninth Congressional District on the April ballot, we will be going to the polls to decide a bond issue as it appropriately should be done at the local level.But what we also do is provide in this bill relief from some of the complicated rules called bond arbitrage rules that both States and localities use when they make that decision, when they go to the local voters and decide whether to renovate or to build or modernize their school structures, we provide some relief for them. That is also in this bill. Finally, we encourage the private sector to donate computers to schools. And so we have that provision in H.R. 7, as well. Probably not as controversial as some of the other things we have discussed.As a final point, and I see we have got one of our other classmates here, then I will yield to the two of you. You mentioned the policy, and I want to talk about the policy, about using the Tax Code for certain incentives. Let me tell you why I think that it is just good policy generally to encourage savings. Right now, and for those, Mr. Speaker, that may be wrestling with their 1040 forms and maybe have C-SPAN on in the background, if you look at your 1040 form on line 8A and line 8B, you plug into, as far as part of your taxable income, your adjusted gross income, any interest you may have earned, whether on a certificate of deposit, whether it is on a savings account, the old traditional savings account or any dividends you receive, you have to add that obviously to your taxable income according to current law and Uncle Sam wants his share.There is no wonder that we are the lowest savings Nation among industrialized countries. We have already precedent in existing law. We encourage people to put aside money after tax dollars for their retirement, with the Roth IRA, a very popular idea. That is, one puts aside one's after-tax dollars, it accumulates interest or earnings, and then it is not taxed when used for retirement.We had a provision that we sent to the President called the SAFE Act that would shield about the first $500 of interest or dividend income again, to help the small or moderate investor, not the Wall Street types that make a living at investment, but really trying to help middle-class families.Along that line, this education savings account, I think, falls right in that good tax policy, and that is trying to provide this incentive to encourage people, especially families, to plug away more money, whether it is putting nickels and dimes or a monthly set-aside from their paycheck into an education savings account for their child or children. Again, what could be more of a worthy exercise than to invest in your own children's future, not rely upon the Federal Government?Again, I commend the gentlewoman for bringing this issue to the attention of the full House. I look forward to the debate. I hope we can have the debate on policy; and I hope the rhetoric does not get too harsh or hot, although that may be asking for a lot; but nonetheless, I urge, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues to support H.R. 7 when it gets to the floor. I thank my friend for yielding me time this evening.,2015-03-17 19:09:47.965642,2015-03-17 19:09:47.965642,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,2000-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-28/html/CREC-2000-03-28-pt1-PgH1455-4.htm,36,6,146,H1455-H1461,H000948,mr. hulshof
2371,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, the Republican leadership has once again succeeded in bringing to the floor a Labor, Health and Education Appropriations bill designed to please only themselves and their right-wing friends. H.R. 4577 fails to make needed investments in public education and the domestic workforce, and, as the result, would undermine American competitiveness in the 21st century. This bill has already received what has now become its customary and well-deserved veto threat from the Clinton administration. It is clearly going nowhere, and should be soundly defeated.This bill was doomed from its inception, because the economic premise upon which it is based is flawed. Earlier this year, before the appropriations process began, the Republican leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich. They attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution. This decision to squander the surplus, rather than invest it, severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our Nation's critical needs.Overall, the bill provides $2.9 billion less than the President request for the Department of Education, and $1.7 billion less for the Department of Labor. As the result, education, job training, workplace safety, and other programs are either frozen or cut, significantly reducing the level of services that can be provided.For example, the bill would slash Title I funding, forcing school districts to cut back on assistance to disadvantaged students. The Clinton/Clay class size reduction initiative is gutted, leaving school districts without the resources to hire and train 20,000 more top-quality teachers. Adequate funding is denied for after-school and summer programs intended to improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime. And no funds are provided to renovate crumbling and unsafe schools.At the same time efforts are ongoing in the Congress to erase limits on the immigration of foreign workers to fill high-tech jobs, this bill would make steep cuts in the funding of training programs aimed at helping domestic workers fill them and other positions. Dislocated workers and at-risk youth are particularly hard hit by these cuts, even though they are the ones most in need of skills training. By failing to adequately invest in our own workforce, the Republican leadership is jeopardizing American competitiveness and prosperity.This bill also jeopardizes worker health and safety by shortchanging OSHA and blocking issuance of the ergonomics rule intended to prevent about 300,000 workplace injuries a year. The Wilson amendment would add insult to injury by cutting $25 million more from OSHA.Mr. Chairman, this appropriation bill is a disaster. It fails to adequately invest in education, and in the development and security of the Nation's workforce. I urge a no vote on H.R. 4577.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time has expired.

2372,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this continuing resolution, our twelfth in 5 weeks, to keep the government operating; but I deeply regret that we have reached this point and I am deeply disappointed by what has happened to America's education priorities in the last 72 hours.On Sunday night, after 3 days of no negotiations, Republicans met face-to-face with Democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education. Democrats asked Republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered, yes. In an example of bipartisan compromise, both sides came together and both sides sought common ground. Negotiators toiled late into the evening. Each side made concessions, as must be done in a bipartisan compromise, and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue. I give great credit to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), and I give great credit to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), and the Senators who were involved. The bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country. This bill included full funding for 100,000 new teachers, teacher training, after-school programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization.Less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached, the leaders of the Republican Party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby.The Republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who, according to the Washington Post, were making, and I quote, ``urgent calls to the Hill to try to block this compromise,'' simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries. This Republican-led Congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes, so that our children could be better educated.Mr. Speaker, I guess it is not a surprise, because Republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating America's agenda, a bipartisan agenda, by giving in to special interests. On every one of these issues, the Republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over America's agenda.We tried to get an affordable, effective prescription medicine program; we forced it on to the agenda with the help of Republican members, and it was scuttled in conference; and it is not going anywhere, because I guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it.We worked with Republicans to force on to the agenda of this House an effective and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights, and it has been stifled in a conference committee because I guess the insurance companies did not want it.We could have had targeted tax cuts for college and long-term care and child care, but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done.We fought for sensible gun safety legislation, but it is stifled in a conference committee, I guess as a favor to the National Rifle Association.We have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage; but it too is stifled, even though it has strong bipartisan support.We forced on to the agenda of this House campaign finance reform, which is desperately desired by the people of this country, and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this House, and it has been stifled in a conference committee.There is a pattern here, Mr. Speaker. There is a pattern. Bipartisan efforts, which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor, are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the Republican leadership that is running this Congress.The Speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order. Well, it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year, we are 6 days away from a general election, and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this Congress would have simply let the bipartisan majority that was trying to break out and do these things to be able to do them. And as a result, we have a dysfunctional Congress; we have an ineffectual Congress.Education is our most important priority. We have schools with cracked walls and no air-conditioning and leaky windows. We have cornices falling off of buildings. We have kids in temporary structures, in movable classrooms, in inadequate facilities in the wealthiest Nation on Earth. Our children deserve our help in getting them the world-class education that every child in this country deserves.Let us pass this resolution, let us stay here in these next days, and let us get the job done for America's children. We may not be able to do the health issues, campaign reform, gun safety or the minimum wage; but in the name of common sense, let us get done something in these last 2 or 3 days for the children of this country. Let us get them better classrooms, let us get them more teachers, let us get them a better education.,2015-03-17 19:09:48.353918,2015-03-17 19:09:48.353918,House,MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-11-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-11-01/html/CREC-2000-11-01-pt1-PgH11718-3.htm,142,23,146,H11718-H11726,G000132,mr. gephardt
2373,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.Mr. Speaker, in 1965, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, chairman of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, gave a forceful speech advocating a greater role of the Federal Government through passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.In that great speech he said, ``We are compelled to give our most sincere and dedicated attention to the masses of our American youth, youth who give America new vision and new goals. We must not wait any longer. It is later than you think.''Today, Mr. Speaker, we are witness to the Republicans' contempt for the masses, for the 50 million children who attend public schools. Today, they bring to this floor a bill that would steal almost $2 billion from our public school systems. This proposal sends a clear and chilling signal that the Republicans have declared war on public education.The most cynical and pernicious provision of this bill is the wholesale and deliberate denial of civil rights. The parents of low-income students who fall for this voucher scheme will be shocked to learn that their children will attend a private school that has no obligation to protect them from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or age. The blatant disregard for civil rights fostered by proponents of this bill is an abomination.Mr. Speaker, yesterday I received a letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights vehemently opposing this Trojan Horse. In that letter, it was pointed out that under this bill, and I quote, ``Private schools could permit widespread and severe racial harassment of students in class, provide female students with inferior athletic facilities, and refuse to make any accommodations for disabled students.''The letter concludes, ``In short, H.R. 2746 would allow private schools to ignore the civil rights laws that have long protected students in federally funded education.''Mr. Speaker, this bill is an outrageous abandonment of civil rights. I find it ironic that the Speaker of the House stood on the floor of this House last week expressing compassion for little black children, while in fact this bill is striping away 30 years of civil rights protections from the very children he professed to help.Mr. Speaker, in all of my years in Congress, I have not heard so many in this Chamber, who for years have refused to look beyond race and poverty, to see the human needs, now plead so eloquently for those who are victimized by their race and economic condition. No one should be deceived by the false promise that this bill is about saving poor children from the debilitating fate of inner-city schools.Last year, Republicans in this House fought with every fiber of their being against increasing the minimum wage. In the 104th Congress, 223 House Republicans voted to cut child nutrition programs by $10 billion and to eliminate the Federal school lunch program entirely. Where was their compassion then?If proponents of this bill are genuinely concerned about bad schools in black neighborhoods and want to give real choice to poverty stricken and educationally deprived students, let them mandate a program to give poor children the opportunity to attend any public school in the area, even in the most affluent neighboring school districts. That would be real public school choice. No reasonable, fair-minded person would deny that schools in more affluent areas have greater resources and their students receive a more complete and demanding education than children in poor neighborhoods.This voucher bill has been condemned by a broad coalition of education groups because it does nothing to address crumbling and overcrowded schools or to improve teacher performance for the 50 million children now attending public schools.I challenge the Republican leadership to stop playing politics with America's school children and to stop bashing public schools, parents, and teachers. I challenge them, Mr. Speaker, to embrace America's public schools instead of attacking them with this deceitful voucher scheme.I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.,2015-03-17 19:09:48.498020,2015-03-17 19:09:48.498020,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,4,143,H9941-H9965,C000488,mr. clay
2374,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I urge a ``no'' vote on vouchers and a ``yes'' vote for public schools. I want to say that I think everybody here tonight is well-meaning and everybody here I would submit cares about what happens to our children, but I believe that we have to enter into a new discussion. Part of that will happen with the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Roemer] on charter schools.There are other ideas that we are wanting to talk about: Early childhood development, Basics by Six, well-trained teachers and equipped classrooms, relief for crumbling and overcrowded schools, support for local plans to review neighborhood public schools, efficient and coordinated use of resources, parental choice for public schools. This is an agenda that begins to start a national conversation about how we improve our public schools.I had a meeting this morning in my district with the superintendents of all of the school districts in my district, the City of St. Louis, many of the county districts in St. Louis, Jefferson County, and I asked them about this agenda, and I asked them about what we ought to be talking about. Incidentally, most of those school districts, in fact all of them, get very good outcomes. That does not mean it is uniform. That does not mean that every kid is getting a good education. It does not mean every child is graduating, but they are getting some pretty darn good outcomes.We never talk much about that; we never congratulate the people in the public schools that are doing a good job and getting a good result, which is the vast majority of our public schools. We act sometimes as if all the schools are bad and all the kids are not getting an education. Not true.Mr. Speaker, when I asked my superintendents what they thought we ought to be talking about today instead of vouchers, they talked about repairing crumbling schools. One superintendent said, yes, you want to talk about computers? I cannot get an electric line from the electric pole outside my school to support computers. And then once, if I got the electricity and got the computers and got the software and trained the teachers, who would pay the connection charges to the Internet?They talked about early childhood education. Every kindergarten in Missouri does not have kids go all day at age 5. They said the best thing you could do would be to have the kids come all day at age 5 into kindergarten so we could get a good start. That would probably be more important than many of the other ideas put together. There is a long list of things that we ought to be talking about our public schools.Let me say to my colleagues, I think the organizing principle of this society should be making sure that every child is a productive citizen. After World War II we knew what the organizing principle in our society was. It was to make sure that we deterred nuclear war and we kept the Russians from invading us, and fighting communism, and everybody knew their role in that great mission that we won when the wall came down. But since then, we do not know what our organizing principle is. And the truth is, it is not just money; it is everybody's commitment to this task of making sure every child gets a chance at a good education.I was in a school in my district last week, Shepard's School in the City of St. Louis, and they had all the mothers there. The principal goes out and sees parents who will not come in and work in the school and the one mother got up and she said, I work at night, but I am here every day from 7:30 in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I am here to do whatever the principal and the teachers want me to do. I said, why do you do this? She said, I have 2 kids in this school and I want them to have a good education and I want them to go to college. But then she said, but understand, every kid in this school is my child.That is the attitude that we have to have on the part of every American in this country. Every child is my child. Even if I do not have a child in the school, I want to be in the school, because we must raise these children to be productive citizens. We must not siphon off the dollars that are so desperately needed by our public schools to go to private schools. We have to make sure that they go to the children that are wanting and demanding an opportunity to succeed.Let us make that the organizing principle of this society. Let us stop this discussion of vouchers and let us get on to the discussion, the unfinished agenda of this country, to make the public schools in this country better. We can do it, and we are going to do it starting tonight.,2015-03-17 19:09:48.700159,2015-03-17 19:09:48.700159,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,166,143,H9941-H9965,G000132,mr. gephardt
2375,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.In regards to that last statement, let me say that we on this side did not open this debate. It was Senator Lott who opened the debate. And this motion to instruct will correct the debate that Senator Lott opened.Mr. Speaker, let me read something from the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, in regards to this particular problem that we are dealing with. Secretary Riley says, ``I am deeply disappointed that Congress took steps in the wrong direction over the last 2 days as it failed to make a long-term commitment to reduce class size. Both the House and the Senate had opportunities to let local school districts know that funds will continue to be available, so that over 7 years 100,000 teachers can be hired to reduce class sizes in grades 1 to 3 to 18 students per teacher. However, they did not only fail to do that but instead, in the case of the Senate, retreated from the bipartisan agreement reached last year. There is nothing more timely or important than giving parents and teachers the reassurance that their children will be able to learn in smaller classes.''And Secretary Riley says, ``I urge Congress to drop the amendments that undermine last year's bipartisan agreement to reduce class size and reach agreement on the Ed-Flex bill with strong, responsible accountability provisions. It is unfortunate that the first education debate of this Congress ended in partisan efforts instead of addressing the serious issues confronting our Nation's schools. Our students, parents and teachers want, need and deserve better.''Mr. Speaker, I do not understand the switch in the Republican position on 100,000 new teachers to reduce classroom sizes. Last year the Republican leadership, including Speaker Newt Gingrich; the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Dick Armey); and chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Bill Goodling) gave glowing praise to the concept of 100,000 new teachers and voted to start on the 100,000 new teachers; voted for $1.2 billion to start funding the 100,000 new teachers.On October 15 of 1998, President Clinton and congressional budget negotiators reached agreement on a bill for 1999. Among the programs included in that agreement was $1.2 billion invested to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes across America. Here is how the Republican leaders described the 100,000 teachers legislation at the time.Former Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``We said the local school board would make the decision. No new Federal bureaucracy, no new State bureaucracy, not a penny in the bill that was passed goes to pay for bureaucracy. All of it goes to the local school districts.'' Then House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, called it ``A victory for the American people. There will be more teachers, and that is good for all Americans.''The majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Dick Armey), when asked what he would say are the key Republican achievements of this bill, responded, ``Well, I think quite frankly I am very proud of what we did and the timeliness of it. We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way to pay for them. And when the President's people are willing to work with us, so that we can let the State and local communities take this money, make these decisions, manage that money, spend the money on teachers as they saw the need, whether it be for special education or for regular teaching, with the freedom of choice and management and control at the local level, we thought this was good for America and good for the schoolchildren. We were very excited about the move toward that end.''That is the end of the quote of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Dick Armey). They were excited about hiring 100,000 new teachers last October.And the chairman of this committee, of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Bill Goodling). Let us see he said about it. He said, ``It is a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed up with the Washington mandates, red tape and regulation.'' He is talking about the mandating of 100,000 new teachers. That is his quote.So, Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues, if they are for reducing classes, if they are for giving children more individualized attention, if they are for improving student achievement, they must support the Clay motion to instruct.We should never pit one group of parents against each other to score political points. The disability community and the Chief States School Officers and the National PTA support this motion.We have promised America's schoolchildren 100,000 new, well-qualified teachers. This motion demonstrates that we intend to keep that promise, and I ask my colleagues to support the motion to instruct.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:48.854268,2015-03-17 19:09:48.854268,House,APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 800, EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-23/html/CREC-1999-03-23-pt1-PgH1549.htm,46,42,145,H1549-H1556,C000488,mr. clay
2376,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise to speak of the need to preserve and protect the intense vital involvement of parents in decisionmaking in local schools all across America. If America is to succeed in the next generation, we have to have the capacity to have the kind of schools that meet the needs of our students. We will have to have the ability to experiment from one school district to another. We will have to have State and local governments that can tailor the programs which they have to meet the demands of their unique settings.Sometimes when we think about achievement, sometimes when we think about success, we think it might be necessary to try and impose the so-called ``wisdom of Washington'' upon the Nation generally. But, I think that temptation ought to quickly fly from us if we would think of what would have happened, for instance, if we decided there needed to be a single uniform type of computer and we had imposed it from Washington saying there would just be one way of doing things. Maybe we would have chosen Apple computers and their way of doing things instead of IBM and their way of doing things. Or maybe we would have chosen a single software company and said that is the only way it could be handled, and we wouldn't have the flourishing and the flowering and the kind of intense opportunity and plurality for the generation of marvelous alternatives that have made America the far and away overwhelming leader in terms of the technology.I think whenever we feel that temptation to draw to Washington, DC, the decisionmaking and the prerogative of developing for the Nation a single uniform policy which would take the diversity and the creativity out of the system and would cheat America of the vital creativity and opportunity that is expressed when people at the local level are involved, whenever we have that temptation, we should think about how bad it would be in so many areas had we had that kind of policy.America's ability to flourish as a success reflects the diversity of this country and the ability of different groups of individuals to approach things differently and to do so successfully. Not only does it provide for us an energy which carries us to excellence, it also means that we don't ever have all of our eggs in a single basket. We have the capacity to meet a variety of challenges. We have innovative and creative thinking. We have the capacity to look at things from different points of view.One of the things that the President sought to bring to the United States--and I think his intention was good--was he wanted to improve education, by bringing to us national testing, testing of students on an individual basis all across America with a uniform test promulgated by bureaucrats in Washington, a single test which would, unfortunately, chart the direction of education all across the country.When you make a test, you decide that you are testing for something. So if you are going to make up a test that is going to be imposed on the country, you are going to be testing for something and you have to define what you are testing for.So the development of a test, although it might not seem to be at first blush, is really the development of a curriculum. If you decide what you are going to test for, you have to decide what you are going to teach. Once you decide what you are going to teach, you have established a national curriculum.Oddly enough, even deciding what you are going to teach probably isn't all that is controlled with the development of a test.The development of a test probably decides how you are going to teach it, because if you teach English, for instance, with phonics, teach people how letters sound together, and combinations and the like, that is one way of teaching the English language and would be tested differently than teaching the English language with the so-called whole language approach where you just have the recognition of words by rote or memorization.So when you have something like a national test proposed, you have to understand that you are talking about uniformity, that you are going to impose a single system all across the country, going to make everybody pretty much the same, you are going to deprive the system of the creativity and the vitality and diversity of what a lot of different folks can do when they are working simultaneously on a problem.Second, you are not only going to have uniformity, but you are going to determine from Washington, DC--if you have a uniform test, you are going to have a uniform curriculum. What to teach and how to teach it then becomes a uniform decision by bureaucrats. Because in order to test accurately, you have to know exactly what you are teaching and, of course, what you are teaching for will depend on how you are teaching.It troubles me to think that we might take these most fundamental decisions in education and pry them from the prerogative of parents and move them to the educators or bureaucrats of Washington, DC.As a matter of fact, the bureaucrats, educational bureaucrats, in Washington, DC, do not have a very good record. The bureaucrats in Washington, DC, run a couple school systems. We know that.As a matter of fact, they run the Department of Defense Dependent School System. A year or two ago they tried to put the so-called whole math into that system. The results were devastating. The median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 Department of Defense dependent school students, 1 year after the Defense Department introduced whole math, dropped 14 percent for third graders--this is the median percentile score--dropped 20 percent for fourth graders, 20 percent for fifth graders, 17 percent for sixth graders, and 17 percent for seventh graders. One year's implementation of a fad, of the new whole math, devastated the performance of those students.I am not sure we want to yield the control of our public schools to the Federal Government so we can have that kind of devastating impact. I sure do not.Maybe, if you think the Federal Government does things particularly well, you should look at another school system which the Federal Government runs. It is called the District of Columbia School System, where, I think, we have the highest per capita expenditure on students anywhere in the world, and we have some of the lowest achievement levels.What I am trying to say is, we do not need to forfeit to the Federal bureaucracy in Washington, DC, the decisionmaking in education of what to teach and how to teach it, and we need far less to take parents out of the equation.Some people might not understand the value of parents in education, but there has been a lot of work in the educational research area about the value of parents in education. A 1980 report in ``Psychology in the Schools'' shows that family involvement improved Chicago elementary schoolchildren's performance in reading comprehension dramatically.One year after initiating a Chicago citywide program aimed at helping parents create academic support conditions in the home, students in grades one through six ``intensively exposed to the program'' improved .5 to .6 grade equivalents in reading comprehension on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills over students less intensively involved in the program--a 50- to 60-percent better level of improvement when the parents are deeply involved.If we are going to take parents out of the equation of what to teach and how to teach and we are going to tell them, do not bother to try to get active in your schools, because if things are not working there, you would have to change the whole country in order to change what happens at your schools, and besides, all the decisions are going to be made at sort of a quasi-national school board in Washington, DC, I do not think we are going to get effective parental involvement. That is why I believe that locally controlled schools are the fundamental thing that we ought to pursue. It is not only true for Chicago schoolchildren, it has been proven over and over again in other cities across the Nation in a variety of studies.It is important that we have parental involvement. It is important that we have local determination. It is important that we not yield to Washington, DC, the capacity to impose uniform curricula and a uniform teaching methodology all across the country. It would stifle creativity. It would impair achievement in a very, very significant way.The Republican agenda for education has not been to centralize education in Washington, DC. Our agenda, as expressed in this legislative session, has been to give local schools block grants. It has been to send them the power to do what they know they need to do.I heard Congressman Goodling from the House talk about the President's plan to improve education with just one more test. We already have between three and nine standardized tests every year for every student in the country, according to USA Today.Congressman Goodling put it this way: ``If you are trying to fatten cattle, they don't get fat by weighing them one more time.'' If you are trying to educate students, they don't get smart just by being tested one more time. Students not only have the regular tests of their instructional regime, they also have these three to nine other tests which are taking instructional time. And they are telling us pretty clearly where we are educationally. We know where there is much to achieve, but weighing the cattle one more time, testing the students one more time, will not make them fatter or smarter.The truth of the matter is, the solution is to do things like the Republicans have sought to do here, which is to get more capacity into the hands of schools so that it can be devoted to students and teachers, not to the bureaucracy in Washington--a clear contrast.The bureaucracy in Washington grows under President Clinton's ability to dictate, through the backdoor of testing, a curriculum and a teaching style in uniformity across America. Under the Republican proposals, instead of having a growing bureaucracy, you take the resource which would otherwise be sapped by the bureaucracy in Washington, and you target it on the schools, you give block grants to local schools.Another Republican initiative, the A-plus accounts, gives parents choices. Instead of taking parents out of the equation by saying we are going to have a national school board that no parent could afford to come and talk to and that would impose a uniform regime all across America, the Republican plan is to empower parents, to give parents choice. Let parents invest resources so that they can send their children to the schools that the parents choose and invest those resources absent the kind of onerous tax burdens that parents normally would have on their investments.The President's agenda is more programs, more bureaucracies, more of Washington-knows-best. The Republican agenda is a commitment to local schools, local control, local education, the creativity, the pluralism, yes, the diversity and the energy that comes when we have local schools all across America.There is an effort being made in this year's appropriations measure to harmonize the kind of demands that are being made by the administration and the items that were passed in the Senate with items that were passed in the House. I think it is fundamentally important that we protect local schools. If we are not willing to stand up to protect the local schools, the prerogative of parents to operate in those schools, to be effective there, to get involved meaningfully in the development of curriculum and the development of teaching methodology, I think we will have failed in our duty.I intend to do whatever I can, as we close this session--and I mean ``whatever I can''--to make sure we arrive at a conclusion which makes it possible for parents to continue to have that kind of beneficial impact.At the end of this year the President and his bureaucrats seem to be winning. America's children are losing. The block grants, which would have cut the Washington bureaucracy by sending more funds directly to local school districts, were all but abandoned, and I commend the occupant of the Chair for having that idea, which is one of the best ideas that has been offered to help education in this Congress in decades.Scholarships for needy children in the District of Columbia were filibustered to death. Instead of giving parents the power to help their children in education, we lost on that ground. And the President has indicated that, if we succeed on that ground, he will veto it.On Tuesday, the Senate voted to kill A-plus accounts to help parents pay for the costs of their children's education. At least the vote was to not allow that to go forward. We could not get cloture. So those who sought to reinforce the position of the President there deprived America of another opportunity for parents to be beneficially involved.We have lost on the block grants. We lost on the A-plus accounts. We lost on the scholarships for DC students that would empower parents.A final ballot remains over national testing. It is a cause from which I do not intend to waiver.I do not think Senators should pack their bags for the recess just yet. There are rights to defend. There are students whose interests are in the balance. I do not think we should sacrifice the next generation's education for a few extra days of rest at the end of this year. I certainly do not intend to do so myself.National tests would lead to a national curriculum. I think we can all understand that. The President keeps saying that the national testing system he is proposing would be voluntary. He said these will all be voluntary. Do not worry. No school district would be required to be involved in these tests.That is what he said in Washington, DC. That is what he said in his State of the Union Message. That is what he said recently. Perhaps he thought we were not listening carefully when he was speaking in Lansing, MI, on March 10 of this year, 1997. He put it this way:I want to create a climate in which no one can say no, in which it's voluntary but you are ashamed if you don't give your kids the chance to do [these tests].Here is a President who says this is to be voluntary, but he says he wants to make it so no one can say no. When the President has the ability to control funding, and when he has the opportunity to give grants and otherwise to make favorable or unfavorable decisions about what happens in schools, I doubt seriously whether there will be a real opportunity for these to be voluntary.William Safire recently warned of the dangers of allowing the administration's testing proposal. And I quote William Safire in his editorial from the New York Times op-ed page entitled ``Flunk that Test.'' He put it this way:We're only talking about math and English, say the national standard-bearers, and shucks, it's only voluntary.I continue to quote Safire.Don't believe that; if the nose of the camel gets under the tent, the hump of a national curriculum, slavish teaching to homogenizing tests, and a black market in answers would surely follow.You know, the evils of a national test have long been understood, not just by Republicans, but by Democrats as well, because they have understood that national testing ultimately dictates national curricula.Perhaps one of the most eloquent in that respect was Joseph Califano. Joseph Califano was the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Carter administration. When Joseph Califano was asked about national tests, he warned the American people. He put it this way:Any set of test questions that the federal government prescribed should surely be suspect as a first step toward a national curriculum. . . . In its most extreme form, [Joseph Califano went on to warn] national control of curriculum is a form of national control of ideas.We could have a long debate about the potential evils of national control of ideas, but it is pretty clear to me that none of us believes that Washington, DC, should control ideas. I think all of us understand that if Washington, DC, controls things, it generally does not do them well. As a matter of fact, what this country has controlled from Washington, DC, has not been exemplary. It has been an example of what to avoid rather than what to embrace.When you are talking with individuals about the so-called tests which they would impose, you have to wonder whether Washington's imposition of tests would be something like Washington's attempted imposition of the standards for history, which they tried to develop at the end of the last decade and early in the 1990's.The National Endowment for the Humanities sought to develop a set of history standards telling us what we should know and what we should teach. What was interesting to me is that the standards tended to be far more politically correct than they were historically correct.When you are thinking about mathematics, I do not think we should think about that which is politically correct or historically correct. We should think about things that are arithmetically correct.But here is what happened to the national history standards. The national history standards were more interested in those who were politically correct.The standards slighted or ignored many central figures in U.S. history, particularly white males. To name a few, Robert E. Lee was left out, Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers were left out, Paul Revere was left out, so we could have many, many references to the Ku Klux Klan, so we could have references to heroes from other continents.The truth of the matter is the U.S. Senate understood what was happening there and voted against those standards. I believe that these standards were rejected unanimously in the Senate. George Will attacked the failed history standards as ``cranky anti-Americanism.'' It didn't surprise the American public. The American public has witnessed the Federal Government go awry, time after time after time on issue after issue after issue.The proponents of the proposed national tests have indicated that their interest is in the whole math curriculum. As a matter of fact, when we found out what they were talking about with the whole math curriculum we discovered they were talking about a rejection of computation. Computation is 3 times 6 is 18; 3 times 18 is 54; 4 times 18 is 72. They reject that. One whole math proponent was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as having said we can't ask students to say 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2, carry the 4. They said that is discriminatory. Most students can't do that, they are too dumb. That is ridiculous. Our students are smarter than that. They are not that dumb.As a matter of fact, the only thing that will dumb down American education is if we have low expectations. I have studies that show when you have low expectations you get low performance. Here you have people designing the tests who want to run away from the ability of American students to compute. They want to supply everyone with a calculator so no one has to know the multiplication table and no one has to do things in his or her head. I think such dumbing down of America's educational performance would be inappropriate.Most importantly, it is fundamental that we maintain in this great land the ability of moms and dads to be at the focal point of educational policy and development and not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. It is fundamentally important that we maintain local control of education rather than Washington control.As we are working our way to see whether or not we can have an appropriations bill that maintains this balance, I want to say to the U.S. Senate that we have an obligation to stay here and work until we do protect the rights and opportunities of the next generation for a decent education by making sure that their parents are in charge, that local school boards and States are in charge, and that we don't forfeit the prerogatives of education policy to bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who would impose a kind of mindless ``dumbed down'' national curriculum which would fail to have the diversity and creativity and energy --especially the energy--that comes from local involvement that we need.I intend to do whatever I can and everything that is possible to make sure that we protect that prerogative. I hope Members of this body and Members of the House will join me in doing so. As we are seeking in these moments to reach an agreement with the White House in this respect, I hope it will be their understanding that a plan to have a uniform stifling environment promulgated from Washington is not a plan for a prosperous America but is a plan which would pull the educational rug out from under the feet of our children and would destroy our capacity to compete in the next generation.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:09:49.009407,2015-03-17 19:09:49.009407,Senate,NATIONAL TESTING,1997-11-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-06/html/CREC-1997-11-06-pt1-PgS11852.htm,154,0,143,S11852-S11854,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2377,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I think you're absolutely right.The idea, though, that we can bring the level of spending that we've got going on under control by just trying to get efficiency, I think that's probably optimistic. I think what we have to do is decide that there are some things that Washington, D.C. should not be doing in the first place. We shouldn't cut it; we should just totally eliminate it. It should just stop. None. We need to take a good look at our Federal spending and say, What are the things the Federal Government has to do? We have to defend our Nation. We know that much. Because the States aren't going to do that. We have to make sure there's no pirates on the high seas. There used to be a law, it was one of the few Federal laws against piracy on the high seas. There was a Federal law when America started that was against counterfeiting, because that was not a State job; that had to be a Federal job.There are very few jobs that originally started at the Federal level. And then everything else, we have to push them back to the States. I would be happy to say, look, if the people of California, or Massachusetts, or Tennessee want to have socialized medicine, let them try it and see how it works. They could learn from Massachusetts. It didn't work well. They could learn from Tennessee. They about shut down medicine in Tennessee. If States want to try these things, let the experiments begin at the State level. But at the Federal level, we have got to basically stop a lot of stuff. The first place I would start with would be just what Ronald Reagan said, shut down that Department of Education.I had a group I was talking to down at a Honda dealership just a couple of days ago and I asked them, How much benefit do you think you've gotten from a whole bunch of Federal bureaucrats that work in the Department of Education? Has it helped your kid any at all? There were these blank looks. No, I don't think it's helped a whole lot.So what happens if you sell the building and just shut down the Department of Education at the Federal level? Why can't that be done at the State or local level? I think we have to ask those tough questions. Maybe you could make a case, gosh, it would be nice if; but we can't afford it.Here's a number: Debt and deficit as a percent of GDP. This is deficit. Here's the United States. We're right alongside of Greece and Spain and the United Kingdom. We're right in there with these European countries that are struggling, and we're not much better off than they are. We're way overspending.Here is debt as a percent of GDP. You've got the United States. There are only two other countries that are worse than we are, that's Greece and Italy.,2015-03-17 19:09:49.165495,2015-03-17 19:09:49.165495,House,THE GOVERNMENT, THE ECONOMY AND JOBS,2010-07-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-07-14/html/CREC-2010-07-14-pt1-PgH5603.htm,104,63,156,H5603-H5610,A000358,mr. akin
2378,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with deep sorrow that I inform the House of the death of Mrs. Mary L. James.Mary, who was born in West Plains, MO, was a graduate of Harrisonville, MO, High School and the University of Missouri, where she received a bachelor of science degree in education. Mary also earned a master's of public administration degree from the University of Kansas.Through the years, Mary dedicated her life to education, health care, and to the betterment of her community and her state. She was a teacher, a volunteer, and lived her whole life surrounded by or working in the news business. In 1999, Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Mary as a member of the University of Missouri Board of Curators, and she became the board's president in 2005.Mary also served organizations affiliated with the University of Missouri, which she so dearly loved, including the Chancellor's Fund for Excellence, the Advisory and Development Committee within the College of Education, and the Griffith's Leadership Society for Women. Mary was also a member of the Jefferson Club. In 2005, the Alumni Alliance recognized Mary for Outstanding Alumni Service to the University of Missouri System.Mary also worked as the executive director of the Cass Medical Center Foundation, on the board of the Healthcare Foundation of Greater Kansas City, and on the board of the Cass Medical Foundation. In 2006, she was recognized by the University of Missouri as a Distinguished Friend to the School of Nursing because of her commitment to health care and to the University.Mary also served as a member of the Harrisonville Park Board, including time as chairman. During her tenure on the park board, she advocated for a community sales tax that led to building a pool and maintenance facility for the city of Harrisonville, she wrote a grant and raised funds to build an outdoor theater, and she helped plan for a community center. Mary was a member of the Harrisonville Chamber of Commerce, the Harrisonville United Methodist Church, Chapter G.R. PEO, Delta Gamma, and the University of Missouri Alumni Association.Mary's family had been prominent in the Missouri newspaper business. Her parents, the late J.W. Brown, Jr., and Wanda A. Brown, were publishers of the Cass County Democrat-Missourian in Harrisonville. Her father served as Missouri Press Association President. She worked for 26 years as the human resources manager for Cass County Publishing, volunteering extensively in her spare time.In 1971, Mary married Bill James, who himself has been a prominent figure in the Missouri newspaper business and is a former president of the Missouri Press Association. Bill is now the publisher of the Daily Star-Journal in Warrensburg, Missouri.Mary, who is survived by Bill, by her two sons and their wives, by one granddaughter, by her mother, and by her sister, will be remembered fondly by all who had the privilege of knowing her, including me. She has led an exemplary life, which ought to serve as a model for young people in Missouri and throughout our nation. I know members of the Congress will join me in paying tribute the life of Mary James and in extending condolences to her family and friends.,2015-03-17 19:09:49.400657,2015-03-17 19:09:49.400657,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF MARY JAMES,2009-01-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-09/html/CREC-2009-01-09-pt1-PgE58-2.htm,4,0,155,E58,S000465,mr. skelton

2381,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to William Clay, Sr., my father, and a former United States Congressman from the 1st Congressional District in St. Louis, Missouri. Bill Clay has fought a long and historic battle in defense civil and human rights for all Americans throughout his life. His dedication and service to our Nation as a leader on education, labor rights and civil rights, aptly earns his place in the Missouri Walk of Fame and the privilege of being honored today before Congress.William Lacy Clay, Sr. one of six children was born on April 30, 1931, in St. Louis, Missouri to Luella Hyatt and Irving Clay. He is happily married to his wife of 55 years Carol, and they have raised three children, Vicki, Michelle and William, Jr.When Bill Clay was elected to Congress in 1968, he was the first African American member elected from Missouri and one of only two African American representatives from states west of the Mississippi River. Throughout his 16 terms in Congress, he gained a reputation as an effective legislator. A staunch advocate for civil rights and social justice, he also served as one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. From 1991 to 1995 he chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and served as the Ranking Member on the Education and the Workforce Committee until he retired.His success can largely be attributed to his belief that there were no permanent friends or permanent enemies in politics, just permanent interests. He was a true advocate for the people that he represented, and he served them well. He's been credited with turning back racial discrimination throughout his career and remains an outspoken leader in our community. An accomplished author, he has documented he history of not only St. Louis, but the political arena throughout the Civil Rights era up to and including the present.He worked tirelessly on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised, always seeking to give them a voice in Congress. During his tenure he authored the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital Financing Act, which provided $375 million in federal loan guarantees for construction and renovation projects at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and played a key role in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including efforts to reduce early grade class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers nationwide.Throughout his illustrious Congressional career, Clay co-sponsored 3,403 bills, of which 279 were enacted. Of the 248 bills that he sponsored, 16 were enacted. Bill Clay was the key sponsor of the transcendent Family and Medical Leave Act, the first bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton. This bill helped change the life of American families. He was instrumental in passing the Hatch Act which reformed the political activities of federal employees.He continues to contribute to the American political landscape through his work as a successful author. He has authored several works including Just Permanent Interests: Black Americans in Congress, 1870-1991 (1992), which many view as essential American political reading. He continues to be a wonderful husband, loving father, and grandfather.Madam Speaker, my father is my hero and I am proud to salute him for his lasting contributions to both our local St. Louis community and to our Nation. His outstanding leadership and sincere commitment to justice make him more than worthy of receiving our recognition and I urge my colleagues to join me in commending Former Congressman William Clay, Sr. for his induction into the Missouri Walk of Fame and his legacy of serving our Nation.,2015-03-17 19:09:49.876022,2015-03-17 19:09:49.876022,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM CLAY, SR.: A CIVIL RIGHTS PIONEER, GREAT LEGISLATOR AND A PERMANENT PART OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE,2008-09-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-09-22/html/CREC-2008-09-22-pt1-PgE1855.htm,150,0,154,E1855,C001049,mr. clay
2382,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge a debate about the budget and Social Security. Tomorrow Republicans mark up their budget in committee. Next week they put it on the floor for consideration. Their budget will reveal the following facts: Republicans spent $4 trillion in surplus funds. They created deficits as far as the eye can see. They drained $2 trillion from Social Security, breaking promises made repeatedly to safeguard these funds. Their policies reversed 8 years of progress. Their budgets brought a historic reversal that impacts people's lives.Fifteen months ago, unemployment was under 4 percent. We were having serious discussions about what we were going to do with this huge and mounting surplus. How much should we save for Social Security? How much should we put into Medicare? How much should we invest in a prescription drug program? Should we put more money in education? Should we pay down more debt? And there were many who said that we could do all of it because the surplus was so enormous.So where are we today, March 12, 2002? We are not discussing what to do with the surplus. The surplus is just about gone. Today we are having that tired, troubled discussion we had for much of the last 20 years: What are we going to do about the deficit? How are we going to save Social Security? What are we going to do to save Medicare? And how are we going to take care of health insurance for the unemployed?This is a Republican budget that breaks promises made over and over in the last 3 years to protect Social Security. It fails to keep our inter-generational contract and commitment. It threatens the retirement security of millions of baby boomers. In the aftermath of Enron, it is the height of irresponsibility.Five times, Republicans put bills on this floor to create Social Security lock boxes. They voted five times to make the trust fund for Social Security inviolate. They voted five times to save Social Security first. Yet, they put forward a budget that jeopardizes Social Security just as the baby boomers are about to retire. Their budget spends the Medicare surplus in each of the next 10 years. It makes a meaningful Medicare prescription drug program impossible. It reduces our commitment to public education, and it cuts programs promoting clean air and water that makes a difference in children's lives.This is not a debate in the end about the budget. It is a debate about integrity, and it is a debate about responsibility. It is a debate about the values we want guiding our budget decisions.What are our values? In this budget, our values call for keeping our commitments by saving Social Security first. Our values call for adding a real prescription benefit to Medicare, where it belongs. Our values call for making every public school a great and successful public school. Our values call for paying the Federal debt down. Our values call for cutting taxes in order to promote long-term economic growth and opportunity.I will never forget 1993. We balanced the budget. We made tough choices because we believed in opportunity, responsibility, and community. We put that plan together using the right values.So I urge Republicans, let us pass a budget that invests in national security, homeland defense, education, prescription drugs and our environment, and keeps Social Security sound and puts the Nation back on the path to fiscal health. Let us have an economic growth summit to reach the goals we all share. Let us get about keeping our commitments. Let us get about saving Social Security first and doing it beginning today.,2015-03-17 19:09:50.032111,2015-03-17 19:09:50.032111,House,THE BUDGET REVERSAL,2002-03-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-03-12/html/CREC-2002-03-12-pt1-PgH788.htm,27,1,148,H788,G000132,mr. gephardt
2383,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, November 11-17 is National Osteopathic Medicine Week, a week when we recognize the more than 47,000 osteopathic physicians, D.O.s, across the country for their contributions to the American healthcare system. This year, we celebrate D.O.s commitment to preventative medicine and end-of-life care. I am especially pleased these festivities are taking place in my home State of Missouri.During National Osteopathic Medicine, NOM, Week, D.O.s and patients celebrate the benefits of preventative health care by looking at the simple things that can be done to live healthier lives. As physicians who treat people, not just symptoms, the nation's D.O.s are dedicated to helping maintain health through a whole-person patient-centered approach to healthcare. And, within that principle, they recognize death as the legitimate endpoint to the human lifecycle and respect the dignity and special needs of both patients and caregivers.During NOM Week, D.O.s across the country will explore multidisciplinary perspectives on end-of-life care, the ethical debate of pain management and physician-assisted suicide and ways to remove communications barriers in the physician-patient relationship at end of life. Activities also educate Americans about end-of-life care and related topics, such as advances in pain management, cultural sensitivities toward final stages of life, organ donation, advance directives, and end-of-life care options and financing.For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives and health of my fellow citizens in Missouri as well as all Americans. Overall, more than 100 million patient visits are made each year to D.O.s. Osteopathic physicians are committed to serving the needs of rural and underserved communities and make up 15 percent of the total physician population in towns of 10,000 or less.D.O.s are certified in nearly 60 specialties and 33 subspecialties. Similar to requirements set for M.D.s, D.O.s must complete and pass: 4 years of medical education at one of 19 osteopathic medical schools; a 1-year internship; a multi-year residency; and a State medical board exam. Throughout this education, D.O.s are trained to understand how the musculoskeletal system influences the condition of all other body systems. Many patients want this extra education as a part of their health care. Individuals may call 866-346-3236 to find a D.O. in their community.In recognition of NOM Week, I would like to congratulate the over 1,700 D.O.s in Missouri, the 616 students at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, 871 students at the University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine and the 47,000 D.O.s represented by the American Osteopathic Association for their contributions to the good health of the American people. ,2015-03-17 19:09:50.187220,2015-03-17 19:09:50.187220,Senate,NATIONAL OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE WEEK,2001-11-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-11-13/html/CREC-2001-11-13-pt1-PgS11718.htm,156,0,147,S11718,B000611,mr. bond
2384,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.First of all, Mr. Chairman, I would like to correct the Record. The previous speaker referred to the TRIO program as a minority outreach program, but it is not. It is a disadvantaged outreach program, and the majority of students enrolled in TRIO are white.Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Riggs). His attempt to ban the use of affirmative action efforts by colleges and universities is nothing more than a scheme to return the system of higher education to the bad old days of racial segregation. If we follow that direction, our schools will again become a bastion of white, male, good old boys.In addition, this amendment completely shatters the bipartisan nature of H.R. 6, which has been successfully developed by the members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. It is a cruel hoax, Mr. Chairman, to declare that we live in a color-blind society in which only merit counts. Merit is only one criterion for college admissions.Children of alumni have always received special treatment. Children of wealthy donors have always been shown preferential treatment. Athletic ability and musical talents have always been major considerations when deciding whom to admit to colleges and universities. Colleges routinely seek to have classes which reflect geographical differences and other kinds of diversity in the belief that diversity is good educationally.Affirmative action was not designed to deny rights unjustly to those qualified, but to provide remedies for those qualified who are unjustly denied. For this Congress to now prohibit efforts by university leaders to correct centuries of inequitable admission practices is an arrogant abuse of Federal power. It has taken the Nation's colleges nearly 3 decades to develop and implement admission policies which have begun to close the educational gap existing between minorities, women, and their white male counterparts.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to Proposition 209, passed by California voters, and its effects on minority admission to institutions of higher learning will be just as devastating. Admissions of African American, Latino, and American Indian students for next fall's classes have plunged by more than half at the University of California at Berkeley; and admissions of minorities to the University of California's three law schools have dropped 71 percent for blacks and 35 percent for Latinos.Mr. Chairman, there is no validity to the argument that enrollment declines are indicative of previously ineligible students being admitted to these institutions of higher learning. The fact is that over 800 minority students with grade point averages of 4.0 and SAT scores of over 1,200 were denied admission to the University of California at Berkeley.The simple fact is that some believe women, blacks, and Latinos should not be afforded a higher education. The Riggs amendment would embody that belief in Federal law. It was bad policy during the awful period of Jim Crow laws in America, and it is bad policy now.Mr. Chairman, measured by any benchmark, access to equal educational opportunity remains a distant dream for racial minorities. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the Riggs antiaffirmative action amendment.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:50.431393,2015-03-17 19:09:50.431393,House,HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998,1998-05-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-06/html/CREC-1998-05-06-pt1-PgH2860-3.htm,55,167,144,H2860-H2920,C000488,mr. clay
2385,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues and I have come to this Congress for one single fundamental purpose: to fight for the working and middle-class families that are at the very heart of this country.Throughout this very long and difficult budget process, we have held every policy and every proposal to a simple test: Does it make it easier for the lives of families that are working hard, trying to educate their children, trying to save for a decent retirement; or does it make that struggle even harder?That is why Democrats fought so hard for a budget that does not cut education, student loans, or summer jobs, or roll back clean air or water standards or abandon the 100,000 police that we so desperately need on our streets.This is not a perfect budget. This has been a difficult compromise on both sides. But I believe we have proven that we can cut the budget without cutting education or the environment, that we can rein in runaway spending without ravaging hard-working American families.Mr. Speaker, while this is a day for both parties to come together, America must not forget that, without the Democratic Party, we would not have kept our commitment to educate America's children, to keep our environment safe and to insure basic health and safety standards in the workplace. Without the Democratic Party, we would not have kept our faith with working families in the middle class.See, that is what the Democratic Party stands for. That is who we are. And that is why even after 2 Government shutdowns and 13 temporary spending bills, we would never ever give up the fight for education and health care and the environment and safe workplaces.I will never forget visiting an elementary school in Houston with the gentleman from Texas, Gene Green, and the gentlewoman from Texas, Sheila Jackson-Lee, seeing the young children playing with computers and learning to read in intensive after-hour classes sponsored by chapter 1, and seeing the hope and the joy of these youngsters in being able to learn. This budget is for those children and their families. Or being in New Orleans and seening the chapter 1 mothers and their children meeting, and hearing a young mother stand up and saying because of chapter 1 she was getting her high school degree and planned to go to college and said she wanted to get her masters degree because her children were enrolled in chapter 1 in an inner-city school in New Orleans.So I commend my Republican colleagues for letting us save those commitments and making this budget work for working families.Today we celebrate a victory, not of party or partisanship, but of America's most basic and important values. Vote for this budget, and let it be a model of the kind of bipartisanship and working together that I will hope will mark the rest of this Congress.,2015-03-17 19:09:50.663553,2015-03-17 19:09:50.663553,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3019, BALANCED BUDGET DOWN PAYMENT ACT, II,1996-04-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-25/html/CREC-1996-04-25-pt1-PgH4046.htm,55,115,142,H4046-H4101,G000132,mr. gephardt
2386,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, I reluctantly rise in support of H.R. 1720 which provides straight reauthorizations for three education programs scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Those programs are the National Literacy Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. The 1-year extensions included in this bill will help add some certainty to these programs as they continue to compete for funding through the appropriations process.In addition, the legislation includes changes to other programs that were worked out through bipartisan negotiations involving both the House and the Senate earlier this year.This bill provides for the privatization of two Government-sponsored enterprises, Sallie Mae and Connie Lee. I have already voted in support of privatization and will do so again today, but, as I said, with reluctance. Let me explain my apprehension.Last Thursday, in response to a request by a member of my staff for harmless information from Sallie Mae regarding privatization revenue, Sallie Mae mistakenly faxed him a document which strongly suggests possible partisan work by Sallie Mae officials on behalf of the Republicans.There are at least two very disturbing things about the document. First, the document is referred to as a ``candidate's package,'' and it is a highly charged, partisan document that will help Republicans attack the direct loan program and gives them ammunition to defend themselves against the accurate charges that they have tried to cut student loans.The second alarming thing about the fax is that it includes a cover page showing that the document was sent to a Republican representative, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Tom Davis, by one of Sallie Mae's House lobbyists. That fax page has a note on it to Mr. Davis that says, and I quote, ``Here's the full candidate's package.'' Other details about this bizarre and potentially illegal activity are described in this morning's Washington Post.However, I might say in defense of Sallie Mae that the president and chief executive officer wrote a letter to me dated September 18, where he says that, and I quote, ``The document which I have subsequently read is completely inappropriate in its language and tone, and I am at a loss to express my disappointment that this should have happened. This material was not sanctioned nor reviewed by either myself or senior management.''Also, the chairman of the board wrote to President Clinton and he noted that he had directed that an internal investigation be conducted and that appropriate disciplinary action be taken against those individuals responsible for this document.Madam Speaker, I think that the appropriate agencies and congressional committees have an obligation to fully investigate this matter, and until that happens, a dark cloud will hang over the issue of Sallie Mae's privatization.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:50.877712,2015-03-17 19:09:50.877712,House,GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1996,1996-09-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-09-24/html/CREC-1996-09-24-pt1-PgH10783-3.htm,133,4,142,H10783-H10802,C000488,mr. clay
2387,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I oppose this conference report for the same reason that I voted against the original bill, H.R. 800. This report fails to include strong accountability provisions and fails to adequately protect Title I provisions that target assistance to our poorest children.It is legislative folly, Mr. Speaker, to let States and school districts waive the Elementary and Secondary Act before its reauthorization has been even drafted or passed. To proclaim an urgent need for this bill is part of the folly and the foolishness.Current law authorizes Secretary Riley to give flexibility to States and school districts by waiver. And the Secretary has granted hundreds of waivers to school districts based on requests that permitted flexibility yet preserved the sound principles of accountability and targeting the funds to areas of greatest educational need.But, Mr. Speaker, this bill creates unprecedented loopholes for States and school districts to avoid their obligation to serve poor school children first. It eliminates the long established requirement that only schools with poverty rates of 50 percent or greater can create school-wide programs with these Federal funds.This bill permits States to serve wealthier schools before serving poor ones and allows States to reduce per-student allocations at poor schools or pass over poor schools entirely to fund those wealthier schools.This conference report also strikes the sunset provision sponsored by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) which was contained in the House-passed bill. The Kildee provision would have required us to review these waiver provisions during the ESEA reauthorization. Despite the strong recommendation by Secretary Riley to consider the waiver provisions as part of the reauthorization of ESEA, the majority conferees agreed to strike the sunset provision.I am pleased however, Mr. Speaker, that the conferees did support my motion instructing conferees to strike the Lott amendment. This amendment was a reckless abandonment of our commitment to parents and students to reduce class sizes. By striking the Lott amendment, we ensured that the $1.2 billion class size reduction fund will be made available this July as promised.Now that we are nearing the completion of this bill, I hope that we can go to work on reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and other education priorities. Mr. Speaker, we must act to authorize the class size reduction program so we can finish the job of hiring 100,000 new teachers that we started last year.We should help communities struggling to pay for school modernization by supporting the Clinton school construction legislation. We must also continue our work to help communities recruit new, highly qualified teachers, and to strengthen accountability for our elementary and secondary education programs.So I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this legislation because it fails to contain minimum accountability provisions and basic protections for poor school children. We should vote against this proposal because it permits Federal funds to be taken from those students in greatest need and given to those in least need.Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:51.009806,2015-03-17 19:09:51.009806,House,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-21/html/CREC-1999-04-21-pt1-PgH2208-4.htm,55,21,145,H2208-H2218,C000488,mr. clay
2388,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Father Thomas J. Savage, S.J., the 11th President of Rockhurst College. The passing of this exceptional man leaves us with a great sense of sadness and grief. Fr. Thom cannot easily be described in words but the impact he made upon the Greater Kansas City region is monumental and reflects his selfness, lifelong mission to assist those most in need. He was not just a leader but a visionary whose accomplishments continue to positively affect our community.Fr. Thom was especially talented in three areas of expertise: urban planning, education, and spirituality. During his tenure at Rockhurst College, he directed the campus renovation and construction of several facilities including the state of the art Richardson Science Center, the Town House Village, the Jesuit Residence, and Van Ackersen Hall. His goal was to expand Rockhurst's services to its students and to the community. Never forgetting the College's neighbors, the made great efforts to make the school inclusive by taking advantage of its urban location. By using valuable input and resources from members of the community as he further developed the area, he opened communication and strengthened a lasting friendship and alliance with the neighbors of Rockhurst.Committed to lifelong learning and the Rockhurst motto: ``Not what to think, but how to think,'' Fr. Thom supervised and supported the revision of the college's liberal arts core curriculum, the introduction of the master's degree programs in occupational and physical therapy, and a unique partnership with Saint Louis University in South Kansas City at the Ignatius Center. In his own life, education played a significant part in shaping his role as a leader for our community and nation. Fr. Thom obtained an undergraduate degree in philosophy and sociology from Boston College, held a doctor of education and a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University, and a master's degree in city and regional planning from the University of California at Berkeley.Instructed in the Jesuit tradition and officially ordained in 1979, Fr. Thom always aimed for high intellectual and ethnical standards and moral responsibility. He was a trailblazer who celebrated diversity, respect and true justice. In each aspect of his life he sought to bring about goodness. Even with a full workload and schedule, he could be heard in a lively debate on Sunday mornings on the radio as one of the hosts of ``Religion on the Line.'' His past roles in our community are evidence of his conscientious and generous intentions. As Co-Chairman of FOCUS Kansas City, Chairman of the Missouri Humanities Council, Vice President of the Kansas City Chapter of Phil Beta Kappa, Trustee of the Liberty Memorial Association, Member of the Menninger Clinic Board of Directors, the Kauffman Foundation Board of Trustees, the Midwest Research Institute Board of Trustees, the Preferred Health Professionals Board of Directors, and the Holocaust Memorial Advisory Board, Fr. Thom demonstrated his personal commitment to many worthy causes. He wrote for several publications and newspapers to share his views on board governance, trustees, Catholicism, and pedagogical issues.Fr. Thom Savage is truly an inspiration for all who knew him and were touched by his innumerable acts of kindness. His sharp, honed wit and personable, outgoing nature were character trademarks and will be sorely missed. Along with many others from our region and across the nation, I mourn the death of this outstanding man. He will long be recognized as a hero, an agent of change, a champion for the underprivileged, a spiritual leader, and most importantly a friend to everyone in my community.Mr. Speaker, please join me in extending sympathy to his mother and the entire Savage family.,2015-03-17 19:09:51.154909,2015-03-17 19:09:51.154909,Extensions,HONORING J.

2389,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fellow Kansas Citian, and a man who has come to embody the ideals we share as a nation. As a player and coach for the Negro League's Kansas City Monarchs baseball team, as coach and scout for the present day Kansas City Royals, and as a community activist promoting reading and education to children, John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil has come to represent some of our most noble values: determination and dignity, humility and excellence. ``Buck'' has been a pioneer and trailblazer throughout his life and illustrious career, and demonstrates in his everyday actions and words that determination is the pathway to success. He is a role model for our children and a champion for our country.As a player, Buck had a career batting average of .288, including four .300-plus seasons at the plate, and led the Kansas City Monarchs to victory in the 1942 Negro World Series. After 12 years as a player, Buck changed hats and managed the Monarchs to four more league titles in six years. Following his career with the Kansas City Monarchs, Buck joined the major leagues as a scout for the Chicago Cubs. In 1962 the Chicago Cubs made him the first African-American to coach in the major Leagues. Buck is credited with signing hall of Fame Baseball greats Ernie Banks and Lou Brock to their first pro contracts, and is acknowledged to have sent more Negro League athletes to the all-white major leagues than any other man in baseball history.Buck is currently the Chairman for the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City and spends his time promoting the achievements of African-American baseball players who played for love of the game, despite being shut out of the majors because of the color of their skin. As a member of the 18-person Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee, he continues to tear down racial barriers by advancing deserving Negro Leaguers for induction to the Hall. In addition to his duties in Cooperstown and at the museum in Kansas City, Buck is finding new ways to enjoy life and share his wonderful exuberance. As a player, coach, scout, writer, and volunteer Buck represents a magnificent example to our generation and the next.Mr. Speaker, please join me in saluting John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil, a distinguished ambassador for baseball and symbol of African-American pride, a true hero for all of America, and a favorite son of Kansas City. Congratulations, Buck on the 1999 John Stanford Education Heroes Award. It is an honor to help celebrate your 88th birthday and demonstrate the Negro League's commitment to education through ``Reading Around the Bases.'' I salute you for your lifetime of achievement, and am both proud and honored to call you my friend. Thank you, Buck, for all you have done, and for all you continue to contribute to our lives.,2015-03-17 19:09:51.290000,2015-03-17 19:09:51.290000,Extensions,HONORING JOHN JORDAN ``BUCK'' O'NEIL ON HIS 88TH BIRTHDAY,1999-11-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-10/html/CREC-1999-11-10-pt1-PgE2336-3.htm,158,0,145,E2336-E2337,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2390,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise to speak on another very important appropriations bill that has been addressed on this floor and is being considered. That is the debate on education in the Labor-HHS bill. We want to see that important bill moved forward, get passed and signed by the President.It is clear that the two sides of the aisle have very differing views on how we ought to go about improving education. Let us all agree that improving education should be our national priority. We on this side happen to think it is a local and State responsibility, but it is a national priority, the top national priority.Now, one side of the aisle trusts the Federal Government to make the decisions. The other side of the aisle, our side, trusts the parents and teachers, the school districts, the school board members, to make those decisions. This side of the aisle seems to base its decision on whether we are successful in education on the total dollars spent. Our side would judge success on academic achievement of students. This side of the aisle believes accountability comes in successfully filling out paperwork, jumping through the hoops that Washington lays out for school boards and teachers. Our side believes accountability is based on academic achievement.Our friends on the other side of the aisle believe that the Olympians on the Hill--Capitol Hill, that is--know what is best for the folks down in the valley. Our side believes that the great ideas, accomplishments, and actions occur on the local level and that the Olympians on the Hill should watch and learn.My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the Vice President talk a good game. Let me give you my view on what is going on. First, they have talked about the 100,000 teachers program, the school construction program. They have proposed to set aside billions of dollars for these programs alone and not allow flexibility that we strongly believe should be rested in the hands of the local schools, the parents who are served by them, and their children, and the people who run them.I support reduced class size. I campaigned for Governor on that basis. I know there are many school districts around the country that need new school buildings. However, as one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, I want to do the right thing. I agree with that. I know our children and parents and schools are counting on us, in my view, to get out of the way and let them do the job they are not only hired to do but they are dedicated to do.We saw in the first debate what happens when Washington tries to make decisions for what is best in local schools. Vice President Gore told a terrible tale about this young girl who had to stand up in class. After the debate, we found out that she had to stand up or she had to have a chair brought in for 1 day because they had $100,000 worth of new computers. The school superintendent said that getting a place for her to sit was not really the problem. I understand he mentioned something about school lunches in another school district, and very quickly some of the folks from that school district said that is not the problem at all. That is not to say--and I am not saying here--that the Vice President didn't hear real concerns, that he made them up.I am just saying: How are we here in Washington, how is the Federal bureaucracy, how is the Department of Education, and how are those of us who are sitting here in this room trying to make decisions for local schools all across the country supposed to know what the problems are in the Sarasota School or the Callaway County R-6 school in Missouri or a school district in California or a school district in Washington or a school district in Maine?There is a lot of talk about 100,000 new teachers. That proposal sounds good. It is a great slogan to use when you are trying to gain national headlines. But when you look at the formula, trying to find out whether it works, it doesn't work.I traveled around to school districts and talked to school boards and teachers and administrators. Let me tell you how that formula works in Missouri. The Gilliam C-4 School District would get $384; the Holliday C-2 School District would get $608; the Pleasant View R-VI School District would get $846.I first heard about this problem from a small school district when someone in that room said: We would get enough money for 11 percent of a teacher. One other person in the room said: We would get enough money for 17 percent of a teacher. They haven't quite figured out how to use 11 percent of a teacher or 17 percent of a teacher or how to spend $846 on a teacher.Over 175 school districts in the State of Missouri would receive less than $10,000 under this program. Surely you don't think they are going to be able to hire a teacher to reach that 100,000 new teacher goal for less than $10,000.Many of the schools have already addressed classroom size at the expense of other things.Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose giving them the flexibility to utilize these resources in another manner which may suit their needs but which doesn't fall into the dictates of the one-size-fits-all solution that Washington is being pushed to propose by the administration and by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.They are saying that we are not providing the school the resources to do what they need to do because Washington is trying to tell them what their priorities should be without knowing why that girl had to stand up or sit on a stool brought in for that one classroom.Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Vice President Gore advocate taking billions of dollars off the table for thousands of schools across the country. To me, the issue is simple. We must give our States and localities the flexibility to use the resources to improve our public education system and to make decisions at the local level.,2015-03-17 19:09:51.521163,2015-03-17 19:09:51.521163,Senate,DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgS10751-3.htm,132,9,146,S10751-S10769,B000611,mr. bond
2391,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, as we meet today in commemoration of Black History month, I would like to comment on the historic battle for educational opportunity that continues to this day in the state of Missouri. The State of Missouri is proposing to end the 17-year-old school desegregation program that is finally, after more than a century of struggle, beginning to offer equal educational opportunity to black children in the city of St. Louis.It is almost impossible to comprehend the current controversy surrounding efforts to end St. Louis' successful voluntary school desegregation program without understanding the sad, sordid history of state imposed segregation in Missouri's public schools. In 1847 the Missouri Legislature outlawed teaching reading and writing to colored children. In fact, for the next 18 years it was a state felony for any person to teach blacks to read or write. The crime was considered so heinous that those who committed it were subject to six months in jail and a fine of $500. Fortunately, there were people of courage who stood up to this preposterous law.Catholics, Quakers and Unitarians, the First Baptist Church, St. Paul A.M.E. and Central Baptist and other colored churches conducted clandestine schools in underground locations. Catholic nuns at the Old Cathedral openly defied the law and taught Negro children. Six Sisters of Mercy defied the state government and opened a school for blacks in 1856.John Berry Meachum, a former slave, purchased his freedom and then saved enough money to buy a cooperage and boat supply company. He used his earnings to buy the freedom of many slaves and let them work for him until he was repaid. Meachum also became pastor of the First African Baptist Church. During the time that it was illegal to teach blacks to read and write, he operated covert classrooms on boats moored to a sandbar on the Mississippi River. When Meachum's boat schools were discovered, he built a steamboat, equipped with a library, and transported black children and illiterate adults to the middle of the Mississippi River where federal law prevailed. There blacks were taught to read, write and add numbers. His floating school continued until his death.Despite, the heroic and valiant efforts of a few, the state government was determined to keep the black citizens of Missouri illiterate and uneducated. In 1865 the Missouri Constitution stated: ``Separate schools may be established for children of African descent. All funds provided for the support of public schools shall be appropriated in proportion to the number of children without regard to color.'' The following year the City of St. Louis opened its first school for blacks. This was 28 years after the City had opened its first school for whites. In that era more than 120,000 blacks lived in Missouri and according to the 1865 report of Superintendent Ira Divoli, colored property owners paid taxes on between two and three million pieces of property.In 1889, the Missouri Legislature enacted a law mandating separate schools ``for the children of African descent.'' A year later, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the statute and in its unanimous decision declared that ``colored carries with it natural race peculiarities'' justifying the separation of blacks and whites. Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court in Plessy V. Ferguson declared segregated education the law of the land and ruled that ``separate but equal facilities were legal.'' As ``separate'' became the edict, ``unequal'' became the standard for black tax-supported education throughout the nation and the state of Missouri.For nearly 80 years after the historic Plessy V. Ferguson decision, the public schools in Missouri were legally segregated institutions of opportunity for white students and ill-equipped, underfunded dungeons of disgrace for black children who were provided an absolutely inferior education. In 1972, a class action suit was filed alleging segregation in the City's public school system. But, in 1979, the federal district court ruled that the St. Louis Board of Education had not violated the Constitution's ``equal protection'' provisions.Finally, in 1980, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recognized the plight of black children and overruled the 1979 decision. The lower federal court then issued an order allowing busing of children for the purpose of desegregating St. Louis' public schools.Since 1980, more than $100 million has been expended to improve the all-black schools in St. Louis and to assist the St. Louis County suburban schools which serve inner city children. Those who now condemn seventeen years as too long and assert that the expenditure of public funds has been too extravagant, need to familiarize themselves with the long and costly history of mis-education of blacks and the role played by the State of Missouri in this long, sad story.I suggest that critics of the St. Louis school desegregation program compare what the State of Missouri spent in dollars and cents to deny black children an equal education with the amount that is now being expended to equalize educational opportunity. It is hardly the time to decry the cost of school desegregation as excessive and wasteful.Under the court-approved plan each year, 13,000 black children from St. Louis attend public schools in the suburban districts of St. Louis County in the largest voluntary metropolitan desegregation program in the nation. White children from the County attend magnet schools in St. Louis and substantial funds are devoted to early grade reading programs and other educational improvement efforts in St. Louis. These thirteen thousand black students voluntarily board buses in the inner-city each school day and go to the suburban school districts where they learn in an integrated atmosphere alongside middle class white students. These poor black children fit into the latest national study showing that poor children attending predominantly middle class schools do much better than their counterparts who go to school with mostly poor children. And, the record reveals that the 13,000 inner-city students attending integrated and magnet schools in middle class neighborhoods are graduating from high school at twice the rate of students attending all black schools in the inner city.These 13,000 St. Louis school children may be, at long last, ending one of the ugliest chapters in the history of the State of Missouri. Yet, unbelievably, some state leaders are rushing to dismantle their classrooms.Mr. Speaker, Black History Month was established to inspire all people to learn a little more about the history of Black Americans. It is a history that Blacks were once denied the opportunity to learn by the power of the state. Those who do not comprehend this are conspiring to gamble away our future.,2015-03-17 19:09:51.824379,2015-03-17 19:09:51.824379,Extensions,1998 CONGRESSIONAL OBSERVANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH,1998-02-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-24/html/CREC-1998-02-24-pt1-PgE196-2.htm,14,0,144,E196,C000488,mr. clay
2392,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, for years, America's charities and churches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. By contrast, government social programs have failed miserably in moving recipients from dependency and despair to responsibility and independence.Successful faith-based organizations now have a new opportunity to transform the character of our welfare system under the ``Charitable Choice'' provision contained in the 1996 welfare reform law. Charitable Choice allows--but does not require--states to contract with charitable, religious or private organizations, or to create voucher systems, to deliver welfare services within the states. The provision requires states to consider these organizations on an equal basis with other private groups once a state decides to use nongovernmental organizations.The Charitable Choice legislation provides specific protections for religious organizations when they provide services. For example, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on the basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based organization retains its independence from government, including control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs.Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious organizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their employment decisions.The Charitable Choice legislation also provides specific protections to beneficiaries of assistance. A religious organization can't discriminate against a beneficiary on account of religion. And if a beneficiary objects to receiving services from a religious organization, he or she has a right to an alternate provider.Finally, there is a limitation on use of government funds. Federal contract dollars cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.I would like to give a couple of examples of how the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare law is currently working.Last fall, Payne Memorial Outreach Center, the non-profit community development arm of the 100-year-old Payne Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Baltimore, received a $1.5 million state contract to launch an innovative job training and placement program. In a matter of only five months, over 100 welfare recipients successfully obtained employment through their participation in Payne's program. A brochure from this dynamic faith-based institution describes why Payne is successful: ``The Intensive Job Service Program reaches out in love to Baltimore's most disenfranchised, helping them to identify and strengthen their God-given talents--releasing and developing their human possibilities.''Another example of Charitable Choice at work is in Shreveport, Louisiana, where the ``Faith and Families'' program, under a contract with the state, is running a successful job placement program. Faith and Families offers job-readiness classes in northwestern Louisiana, helps set up job interviews, and opens doors into the workplace.The program also links welfare families with faith communities. Churches are asked to adopt a family and provide assistance--possibly child care, transportation, work experience, tutoring, and encouragement--that will help them make the transition from welfare to work.I spoke with the director of Faith and Families in Shreveport just last week, and he told me that his organization has helped 400 people get off welfare and find jobs.These examples demonstrate that under the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare law, caring, faith-based organizations are providing effective services that help individuals move from dependency to independence, from despair to dignity.With this in mind, today I am introducing ``The Charitable Choice Expansion Act of 1998,'' which expands the Charitable Choice concept to all federal laws which authorize the government to use non-governmental entities to provide services to beneficiaries with federal dollars.The substance of the Charitable Choice Expansion Act is virtually identical to that of the original Charitable Choice provision of the welfare reform law. The only real difference between the two provisions is that the new bill covers many more federal programs than the original provision.While the original Charitable Choice provision applies mainly to the new welfare reform block grant program, the Charitable Choice Expansion Act applies to all federal government programs in which the government is authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide federally funded services to beneficiaries. Some of the programs that will be covered include: housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, juvenile services, seniors services, the Community Development Block Grant, the Community Services Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, abstinence education, and child welfare services.The legislation does not cover elementary and secondary education programs--except it does cover GED programs--or higher education programs. Further, the bill does not affect the Head Start program or the Child Care Development Block Grant program, both of which already contain certain provisions regarding the use of religious organizations in delivering services under those programs.We have taken measures to strengthen the bill by providing more protections to both beneficiaries and religious organizations. For example, the government must ensure that beneficiaries receive notice of their right under the bill to object to receiving services from a religious organization. Additionally, religious organizations must segregate their own private funds from government funding.This proposal is necessary because while some areas of the law may not contain discriminatory language towards religious organizations, many government officials may assume wrongly that the Establishment Clause bars religious organizations from participating as private providers.The Charitable Choice Expansion Act embodies existing case precedents to clarify to government officials and religious organizations alike that it is constitutionally allowable, and even constitutionally required, to consider religious organizations on an equal basis with other private providers. It is my hope that these protections in the law will encourage successful charitable and faith-based organizations to expand their services while assuring them that they will not have to extinguish their religious character when receiving government funds.I am pleased to say that there is broad-based support for the Charitable Choice Expansion Act. Some of the organizations supporting the concept of this legislation include Agudath Israel, American Center for Law and Justice, Call to Renewal, Center for Public Justice, Christian Coalition, Christian Legal Society, the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education, National Association of Evangelicals, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the Salvation Army, Teen Challenge International USA, and World Vision.America's faith-based charities and nongovernmental organizations, from the Salvation Army to Catholic Charities, have moved people successfully from dependency and despair to the dignity of self-reliance. Government alone will never cure our societal ills. We need to find ways to help unleash the cultural remedy administered so effectively by charitable and religious organizations. Allowing a ``charitable choice'' will help transform the lives of those in need and unleash an effective response to today's challenges in our culture.

2393,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Ms. Paula Smith, a trail-blazing business woman and beloved member of the St. Louis community, who recently passed, on January 28, 2010, at 76. Ms. Smith devoted over 30 years of her life to public service and worked tirelessly to better the lives of those around her.At the age of 16, Ms. Smith dropped out of high school, but she later earned a high school equivalency diploma and then went on to receive a degree in economics from Washington University. Ms. Smith's education did not end here; she earned a master's in business administration from St. Louis University and did graduate work at Harvard. Ms. Smith's dedication to her education was a testament to her entrepreneurial spirit and allowed her to contribute to the St. Louis community, as well as to society as a whole.Ms. Smith's career in public service began in 1981, when then Governor Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond appointed her director of the state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. At that time she was the only woman and the only African-American in the Governor's cabinet. Throughout her career Ms. Smith broke barriers and defied expectations, proving to those around her that she was capable of making an impact in the most profound way.After serving the Governor for several years Ms. Smith was summoned to Washington by President Ronald Reagan to run the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. In 1990 Ms. Smith returned to St. Louis and started her own business: she opened a consulting company and used her years of experience in Washington and as an employee of Kit Bond to make a difference in St. Louis.Throughout her life Ms. Smith demonstrated a commitment to improving life for those around her; she strove for social justice and fought to ensure equality for all. She was passionate about her civic and philanthropic work and determined to make a profound impact in her own community. Ms. Smith's powerful legacy lives on through her three children. Her daughter, Cheryl Walker of St. Louis, is now a lawyer and her two sons, Dwayne and Dwight Bosman, are both well-known jazz musicians.Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Ms. Smith; a woman who always strove to make a difference and succeeded. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Paula Smith, an amazing woman whose legacy will forever be remembered. I extend my sincerest condolences to her family and friends.

2394,MO,Todd,Akin,R,You know, the thing that was interesting to me, about December of last year there was a guy who is one cool businessman, he is the CEO of Emerson Electric--which is not a big household name to a lot of people, but Emerson is a gigantic manufacturing company headquartered in St. Louis with operations in countries all over the globe. And this guy was a little bit--I won't say it was a rant, but he was fired up. He said, Look, I think I know something about job creation. And he went back over the record of that company and all of the jobs that had been created and how profitable they were and what they were doing in manufacturing. They have all kinds of really high-tech kinds of things like the electronic controls that control different businesses and huge complicated process industry and things like that, a lot of very sophisticated stuff. They have all of these jobs they have created through all of these years.So this guy is the CEO of this place. He has come up through the ranks. He is an engineer; he knows what it takes to make a company work. And he says, I'll tell you what, with what's being done in this country I can guarantee you we won't be creating jobs in America. We'll create jobs--we're going to create them in foreign countries because the foreign countries aren't doing this crazy stuff. We can put the jobs there and make a decent profit. Essentially what he's saying is the U.S. Government is forcing us not to make jobs and to do all our job creation overseas.Now, that's a tragedy; that's a tragedy. And he was shook up about it. He was upset about it because he's an American; he loves this country. He wants the jobs to be made here. But, no, we're going to do this socialized medicine gig, which has never worked in any country of the world. I mean, at a minimum, we could learn from the former Soviet Union. They had the theory that the government should provide you a job and health care and an education and food and a place to live. That's what their theory was, and it didn't work worth a crud and the Soviet Union collapsed. And so what are we doing? Well, the government is going to provide you now with education and food and housing--and health care, of course.I yield.,2015-03-17 19:09:52.479844,2015-03-17 19:09:52.479844,House,THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY,2010-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-04-21/html/CREC-2010-04-21-pt1-PgH2779-12.htm,57,21,156,H2779-H2786,A000358,mr. akin
2395,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Marvin Teer, Sr., a valued member of the St. Louis community. Mr. Teer passed away on May 27, 2010, at the age of 93. His efforts greatly enriched the city of St. Louis, and his legacy will continue to inspire his residents for years to come.Mr. Teer grew up against a backdrop of adversity and racial tension. He was born in Meridian, Mississippi, and at the tender age of 5, his family suffered the tragic loss of Mr. Teer's uncle, who was lynched. Mr. Teer's parents moved the family to East St. Louis in search of new opportunities for themselves and their children. Mr. Teer took full advantage of those opportunities, graduating from Lincoln Senior High School and going on to earn his bachelor's degree in education and two master's degrees, one in education and another in administration.In World War II, he fought courageously in the Army, which was at that time segregated.

Mr. Teer participated in a diverse array of city organizations, including the Metropolitan Youth Commission, the St. Louis Board of Equalization, the Board of Building Appeals, and the St. Louis Area Agency on Aging.Upon his retirement, Mr. Teer directed his enthusiasm for serving his community toward the goal of providing transportation to the seniors of St. Louis. He co-founded Available Citywide Transportation, which grew from one van to a fleet of 43 under his watch.Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Mr. Teer, a citizen whose commitment to his community was a testament to Missouri and to America.

2396,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, today, as Women's History Month comes to a close it is a good time to reflect on the many accomplishments women have been part of and to address what needs to be done further to fully carry out equality for all and get our economy back on track.As we experience the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression we will need the leadership of all Americans including strong leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was the first woman chosen as Speaker by her colleagues and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who ran an historic campaign for the presidency. Both who have broken and shattered the glass ceiling have demonstrated remarkable accomplishment the nation can be confident in during these tough times.This nation has faced multiple challenges that we have faced with the help of strong women. And today many women face challenges of succeeding in the workplace, caring for their family including their aging parents. I am proud of the work this Congress has done in a short amount of time for American working women.It is telling that President Barack Obama's first bill signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that reverses a Supreme Court ruling that made it more difficult for Americans to pursue pay discrimination claims. At a time when too many workers are seeing their jobs and wages slashed, we've got to make sure that all Americans are paid fairly for their hard work.Congress has also passed significant tax cuts for working women and major investments in health care. To help get us out of this economic mess we also created thousands of jobs where women have new opportunities including contracting opportunities and the availability of small business loans.Speaker Pelosi said it best: ``Women want what men want: an equal opportunity to succeed, a safe and prosperous America, good paying jobs, better access to affordable health care, and the best possible education for our children.''President Obama and this Congress have made progress with all those issues in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and will continue to build upon those accomplishments with the passage of the President's budget blueprint, which makes investments in health care, energy and education--all intended to create jobs.,2015-03-17 19:09:52.957191,2015-03-17 19:09:52.957191,Extensions,WOMEN ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY,2009-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-31/html/CREC-2009-03-31-pt1-PgE831.htm,54,0,155,E831,C001060,mr. carnahan
2397,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Reclaiming my time, it does my heart a great deal of sadness to see my friend from Texas without a little bit of a twinkle in his eye, which is so commonly there. But this is a very serious subject. We try not to yell and scream too much about it, but we know that economically what's being done is going to harm our constituents. It's getting rid of jobs. It's making the small businessman have to basically shutter down and to keep his operation small, which is exactly the wrong thing for what we should be doing.And why is it that we need all of this money? That is the question that I think we need to be asking. Why is it that we have to be spending all this money on government programs? And the answer seems to me to be, again, we're not learning very well from history. Just bear with me for a second. I'd like to get your perspective on this.A certain number of years ago, there was a thing called the Soviet Union, and they were bad guys. And they were a bunch communists and they were socialists. And what was it that they thought? They thought the job of the government should be to provide you, first of all, with a job, and then they wanted the government to give you health care and food and housing and an education. And one thing particular about them, they didn't want you to talk about God ever.Now, in our country, let's see, we've got all this government spending going on so the government can provide you with health care and a job and food and housing and an education and it's politically correct not to talk about God because if you did that, gentlemen, you'd realize your rights come from God.

2399,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor two men who have spent many years serving their community in Springfield, Missouri, as charter members of the Board of Trustees of the Ozarks Technical Community College. Frank Farmer and Don Wessel both enjoyed long and distinguished careers in private business before being selected by their neighbors to serve on the newly created Board of Trustees, following the creation of the school in April 1990. They have each been reelected to consecutive terms since then; at the end of this month, both men will be ending their tenure of service.Farmer and Wessel helped shape the growth and direction of a school that serves the students of 13 public school districts in southwest Missouri--and far beyond that. The growth of the school has been nothing short of a phenomenon, with enrollment this year topping more than 10,000 students. OTC, as it is known to many local students and residents, is also moving forward on plans to expand its operation to a second campus in Ozark, Missouri, with an eye on affording greater accessibility to its growing student body.From its modest beginnings in central Springfield at the old vocational-technical school, OTC has blossomed into a modern campus that has helped revitalized center Springfield and help train its local youth.From the beginning, Farmer and Wessel led the way in developing the infrastructure and educational leadership OTC would depend upon for its spectacular growth. First they hired an effective president in Norman Myers. The board of trustees, led by president Wessel from 1992 to 1994 and Farmer from 1994 to 1996, embarked on a plan to build new classroom buildings and greatly expand the number and diversity of available courses available to students.Farmer's background in education includes service on the Willard Board of Education, on which he also served as president. Journalist, author and dairyman, Farmer has lent his experience and expertise to several public boards and charities, while attending to his duties as the editorial page editor of the Springfield News-Leader before his retirement there.Wessel is a well-known car dealer and philanthropist, who has been active in the Springfield Chamber of Commerce, American Red Cross, Cox Medical Centers, and has served on virtually every public and civic board in the Springfield area.To Mr. Farmer and Mr. Wessel, I wish to extend a heartfelt ``thank you and well done'' for their untiring work over the last two decades.

2400,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Dr. Benedict K. Zobrist, the former director of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library.Dr. Zobrist was born in Moline, Illinois, on August 21, 1921, son of Benedict and Lila A. Colson Zobrist. He graduated from Moline High School in 1939 and went on to attend Augustana College, but left his studies to join the United States Army in 1942. After serving in World War II and upon discharge from active duty, he returned to complete his college studies. It was at Augustana College that he met Donna Anderson, his future wife. Benedict graduated in 1946 with a bachelor's degree in history and began graduate school at Stanford University. However, he returned to the Midwest to be closer to Donna and on October 23, 1948, they were united in marriage.Dr. Zobrist resumed his studies at Northwestern University, earning both a master's degree (1948) and a doctor of philosophy degree (1953) in history. After completing his education, Dr. Zobrist joined the staff of Augustana College, where he became a full-time faculty member in 1960. In 1962, he won a Fulbright Fellowship and studied at Tunghai University in Taichung, Taiwan. He also pursued advanced studies at the East Asia Institute at Columbia University in New York in 1962-63. Dr. Zobrist moved to Missouri in 1969 to join the staff of the Truman Library in Independence; he became director shortly thereafter. He worked diligently to expand the collections of the library, traveling from coast to coast to meet with members of the Truman administration, as well as other significant figures of that period. Zobrist expanded the work of the Harry S. Truman Library Institute, the not-for-profit foundation associated with the library. He went on to charter a course for the expansion of the Institute's education efforts and its support of the library's operations within the National Archive system. Dr. Zobrist was most proud of instituting ``Truman Week'', a week long annual celebration held around President Truman's May 8th birthday.Dr. Zobrist maintained his affiliation with the United States Army as a reservist, and retired as lieutenant colonel. He spent many summers on active duty with the Office of the Chief of Military History in Washington, DC,; he also served as a faculty member at the Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, and the Army Intelligence School, Fort Bragg.Madam Speaker, I know the members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to Donna Anderson Zobrist and their three sons: Karl, Mark, and Erik.,2015-03-17 19:09:53.812799,2015-03-17 19:09:53.812799,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF DR.

Under her dedicated leadership, the medically underserved and uninsured receive comprehensive medical treatment daily across the St. Louis Metropolitan Area. The St. Louis community will celebrate Ms. Kerr during a very special Gala Weekend, which includes a historical renaming of PHC to the Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers. This is a fitting tribute for an extraordinary woman who has been credited with taking her vision of community health to an international level.PHC Health Centers, PHC, has a 35 year history of providing essential primary care and prevention health education risk reduction services. Under Kerr's leadership, the PHC campus is now a sprawling community of apartments for the elderly, housing for persons with disabilities, social security services, primary health care, dental services, a pharmacy, affordable homes, small businesses, and school-based sites that provide increased access to health in conjunction with health center locations. All health services are provided by clinicians who are accountable for addressing the personal health needs of the residents in St. Louis. The success of PHC is a true reflection of Kerr's commitment and dedication to ensuring that primary care and prevention services are efficiently provided, regardless of a patient's socioeconomic status.Kerr has also ventured beyond medical treatment by incorporating medical research into PHC. By partnering with government agencies, teaching institutions, and a host of other participants, PHC is able to conduct clinical research trials in an effort to improve health outcomes for medically underserved persons with chronic diseases. And reduce health disparities. Ms. Kerr has a strong belief that every citizen has the right to a long and healthy life. She continues creating unique programs, such as the Sharing the Care Program, which allows eligible PHC participants to receive life-saving drugs free of charge.Kerr has recently extended her mission of serving the underserved through the Betty Jean Kerr Scholarship. These College Family Life Assistant Scholarships are awarded to African American students with an interest in higher education in the fields of health and health related professions.Madam Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Betty Jean Kerr today before Congress.

General Lord is retiring after serving in our nation's Air Force with distinction for over 37 years.General Lord received a Bachelor of Science in education from Otterbein College in Ohio, where he entered the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program. He earned a Master's degree in industrial management from the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks. He also attended the Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base.After entering the Air Force in 1969, General Lord served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty. He was the Director of the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in West Germany and he was the Commander of two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. At Vandenberg Air Force Base in California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He led Air Force Education as the Commander of Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base and was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff for the Headquarters U.S. Air Force.

2403,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I rise today in opposition to the rule before us.The ethics process in this body is broken. In all candor, there is plenty of blame to go around as to why we find ourselves in this situation. We undermine the public's faith in this great institution when we let petty politics erode the very processes meant to preserve the public's trust in Congress.I have met with the Majority Leader on this issue, and I sincerely believe that he has a genuine desire to have an effective, functioning Ethics process in the House. I thank him for his willingness to listen, and I hope we can perhaps address this issue in the future.Having previously served on the Ethics Committee, I firmly believe that the ethics process can work. For the sake of this institution--it must work. And as we begin consideration of the Leadership's ethics and lobby reform package, I will say there are some provisions in the base bill before us that should ultimately be adopted--earmark reform, denying Congressional pensions to convicted felons, enhanced disclosure and improved ethics education are common-sense proposals that I would hope that we can all support.That being said, I cannot support this rule. Ethics reform is incomplete absent changes to improve the enforcement of House rules. My colleague Joel Hefley and I have put forward legislation to strengthen the ability of the Ethics Committee to dispense with ethics matters by expediting the review of these issues and insulating committee members and non-partisan staff from the political pressures that can pollute the ethics process. We do this by giving the Chair and Ranking Member on the committee subpoena power earlier in the investigative process and prohibiting the arbitrary dismissal of Members and technical staff. We also require ethics education for Members and staff, and we dramatically improve disclosure associated with gifts and travel. All of these common-sense reforms would greatly improve the ethics process in the House.We sought to offer our legislation as an amendment to the bill we are to consider today. This proposal was not made in order under the rule. Thus, we are faced with the prospect of passing an incomplete ethics reform package that lacks enhanced enforcement.I think this is a mistake, and for this reason, I must reluctantly oppose this rule.,2015-03-17 19:09:54.584345,2015-03-17 19:09:54.584345,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4975, LOBBYING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2006,2006-04-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-04-27/html/CREC-2006-04-27-pt1-PgH1877-7.htm,48,87,152,H1877-H1886,H000948,mr. hulshof
2404,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express gratitude for the passage of H.R. 5574, the Children's Hospitals GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2006. This bill will extend funding through fiscal year 2011 for children's hospitals that provide approved graduate medical residency programs. Hippocrates once said, ``Healing is a matter of time, but is sometimes a matter of opportunity.'' Kansas City's Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics continue to provide numerous opportunities for the children of Missouri and Kansas to receive the best pediatric healthcare available. The services Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) provides are invaluable. The $7 million received by Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area trains 125 interns and residents from the University of Missouri-Kansas City Medical School each year. The CHGME program ensures that children will continue to receive excellent healthcare and our Nation's pediatric health workforce will remain strong and competitive for years to come.Since Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City is the only children's hospital between St. Louis, Missouri and Denver, Colorado, I know it is essential to continue to provide this vital funding. These valuable funds will keep the hospitals running efficiently while training our future pediatric care providers. I will support the restoration of CHGME's full funding for $300 million when the House considers the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2007.Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics provide services spanning from Wichita, Kansas to Springfield, Missouri, and the passage of H.R. 5574 will ensure on-going financial support for over 60 children's hospitals, including Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City where the program started. From heart surgery to brain tumors to burn treatment, patients at Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics know they are receiving the best medical care possible and parents will never forget the ``angels'' who saved their children's lives.

2405,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a distinguished career at the Naval Postgraduate School will soon come to an end. Mr. Richard Elster has announced his official retirement after 37 years of service.After receiving his bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota in 1962, Richard pursued his M.S. in Industrial Relations, and his PhD in Industrial Psychology. By 1967, Richard had finished with school and become a project scientist at Litton Industries.Dr. Elster became associated with the Naval Postgraduate School in 1969 when he joined the faculty as an assistant professor. During his tenure, he served as an associate professor, professor, Chairman of the Department of Administrative Sciences, Dean of Instruction, and the Provost and Academic Dean.Throughout his career at Naval Postgraduate School, Dr. Elster served in several high ranking Pentagon positions. Starting in 1975, he served as special advisor to the Secretary of Defense for manpower and reserve affairs. Dr. Elster also held positions as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Resource Management and Support.Dr. Elster was recognized for meritorious civilian service as Provost and Academic Dean at the Naval Postgraduate School, from July 1995 to December 2005. Because of his leadership, the Naval Postgraduate School attained unprecedented stature in the defense establishment and the academic community. It was recognized in 2005 with the highest score for military value of all Department of Defense education commands by the Education and Training Joint Cross Service Group.The Naval Postgraduate School is respected as a world class research university due in part to Dr. Elster's leadership, strategic vision, and devotion to public service. Much of the academic work of the school's students and faculty responds directly to real world defense mission needs.As Dr. Richard S. Elster prepares for retirement, I know the Members of the House will join me in expressing appreciation for his dedication to the Naval Postgraduate School and will wish him well in all the days ahead.,2015-03-17 19:09:55.112722,2015-03-17 19:09:55.112722,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RICHARD S.

2406,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay honor to an institution celebrating its centennial milestone this month. College of the Ozarks is an institution of higher learning that for many years was known as ``The School that Runs on Faith.'' This small Christian college, located in the hills near Branson and Hollister, Missouri, has seen its share of struggle and triumphs. But central to the College is its mission of providing a Christian education to young people from the Ozarks who are deserving, yet financially unable to procure such training.Originally, the purpose of The School of the Ozarks, also known by its students and graduates as ``Hardwork U,'' was to provide an opportunity for a high school education. This mission was pursued without significant change until 1956, when The School of the Ozarks added 2 years of junior college to the 4-year high school program. This format continued until 1964 when the Board of Trustees and the faculty voted to expand the 2-year program into a 4-year liberal arts program. The 4-year college program of The School of the Ozarks began classes for juniors in September 1965. In 1990, the Board of Trustees approved changing the operating name of The School of the Ozarks to ``College of the Ozarks.''The distinctive tradition of the work program and the College's commitment to its five-fold mission of academic, spiritual, cultural, vocational, and patriotic growth in its students has attracted and continues to attract famous guests, including U.S. Presidents and First Ladies, U.S. Commanding Generals, Prime Ministers, and other dignitaries who recognize its uniqueness. Today, the College offers degrees in 34 academic areas, and student enrollment is approximately 1,400.More than ever, our country needs young men and women with these values to serve as leaders. Dr. R. M. Good, who led the school during the Depression years once said, ``Investments in humanity bring substantial and sure dividends.'' This is why the College has a renewed commitment this centennial year to continue its worthy, distinct mission--a tradition that works. It is these things--a respect for and appreciation of our roots and work tradition, as well as the prospect of a promising future--that College of the Ozarks will celebrate throughout its centennial year.I want to wish College of the Ozarks another 100 years of service to the region, educating and inspiring students with a curriculum that emphasizes character, faith and excellence.,2015-03-17 19:09:55.353892,2015-03-17 19:09:55.353892,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLLEGE OF THE OZARKS,2006-11-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-11-15/html/CREC-2006-11-15-pt1-PgE2052.htm,129,0,152,E2052,B000575,mr. blunt
2407,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, a resolution recognizing the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME, on the occasion of its 125th anniversary.125 years ago, a group of prominent mechanical engineers gathered in the New York offices of the ``American Machinist'' to form what ultimately became ASME, one of the premier professional engineering organizations for technical education and research issues. Since 1880, ASME has worked to advance technological knowledge and facilitate the transfer of information from research to application.Significant among ASME's many achievements is its efforts to improve the safety and reliability of equipment, especially boilers. In the year that ASME was founded, nearly 160 boiler explosions occurred in the U.S., each of which brought death and injury. During this period of industrial growth, boilers were becoming larger, more numerous and dangerous.On March 10, 1905, a boiler explosion at the Brockton Shoe Factory resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries and completely leveled the factory. Terrible accidents like Brockton drove the creation of ASME's comprehensive Boiler Code, a set of standards to ensure the reliability and predictability of machine design and production. Quickly adopted by most States, this code virtually eliminated boiler explosions in the United States.Today, ASME has thousands of volunteers working on committees that combine to issue more than 600 standards, ensuring proper specifications for a wide range of manufactured items. From the pressure valve of boilers to the threads on a screw, these standards ensure that equipment fits and holds safely, protecting American workers and the general public.Some of our most prominent Americans have helped found ASME and many of our greatest innovators have occupied its board. Many will recognize the names of such members as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and George Westinghouse.ASME continues this proud tradition more than a century later, engaging men and women of substance in emerging and future technical fields and cultivating the next generation of industrial leaders. In fact, ASME fellows can be found in the Halls of Congress and throughout the administration, providing valuable insight on legislation, regulation, and policies related to technology and the practice of engineering. The ASME members are tireless advocates for quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education for students of all ages.For 125 years of service to the U.S., I want to extend my warmest and heartfelt congratulations and sincere appreciation to President Harry Armen and the members of ASME for their strong and inspired leadership. I look forward to our continued association and future ASME achievements.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:09:55.588060,2015-03-17 19:09:55.588060,House,CONGRATULATING ASME ON THEIR 125TH ANNIVERSARY,2005-03-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-03-02/html/CREC-2005-03-02-pt1-PgH852-6.htm,22,6,151,H852-H854,A000358,mr. akin
2408,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that I inform the House of the death of Dr. David Henson of Jefferson City, Missouri.Dr. Henson grew up in Orlando, Florida. He attended Florida A&amp;M University where he received a B.S. degree in Biology in 1961. In 1968, he earned a M.Sc.Ed. degree in Chemistry from Tuskegee University. In 1972, Dr. Henson received his Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry from the University of Iowa.For more than two decades Dr. Henson made significant contributions to the field of higher education. Most notably, he was the Acting Chairperson, Department of Biochemistry, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, and Associate Professor of Biochemistry at Howard University College of Medicine; Dean of Student Affairs, Associate Dean of Yale College, Lecturer in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and Fellow in Timothy Dwight College at Yale University; Provost and Professor of Chemistry at the Broward Campus of Florida Atlantic University and Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Services/Student Support Services at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Dr. Henson also served as President and Professor of Chemistry at Alabama A&amp;M University in Huntsville, Alabama, and as Vice President of Student Services at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. On July 2, 1997, Dr. Henson became the seventeenth President of Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri. Under his leadership Lincoln University experienced unprecedented growth and renewal.Dr. Henson also was involved in the Jefferson City community. He served on the Board of Directors for the Jefferson City Chamber of Commerce, was a member of the Jefferson City Leadership Forum and the Rotary Club of Jefferson City.Dr. Henson was a member of Sigma XI Honorary Society, Beta Kappa Chi Scientific Honorary Society, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and an Honorary Member of Kappa Kappa Psi Band Organization. Dr. Henson received the ``African Americans Who Make a Difference Award'', the Howard University College of Medicine Student Council's Award for ``Excellence in Teaching'', the George Washington Carver Research Foundation Student Award, and an American Council on Education Fellowship.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Henson was a valuable leader in his community and was respected by everyone who knew him.

2409,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member from Connecticut for yielding me time.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution honoring the late Senator Paul Simon. It was my privilege to have known Senator Simon for most of my life. I have fond memories of watching Congressman Simon on the House floor many years ago when I was a student and a doorkeeper, and he has long been a source of personal inspiration.When I first came to know Congressman Simon, he represented Southern Illinois and served with my father on the House Committee on Education and Labor. He was among the most active and effective Members in the history of this institution, and I was not surprised when I recently learned that in 1983, Time Magazine cited Congressman Simon for passing more amendments than any other Member of the U.S. House of Representatives.Paul Simon served in the Illinois House of Representatives, the Illinois Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Throughout his career, Paul Simon was famous for championing the causes of working people, children, the disabled and veterans. When he served in the Illinois legislature, he helped to create the State's community college system and the Illinois Arts Council. He also won the Independent Voters of Illinois Best Legislator Award every session in which he served.While serving in the U.S. Congress, Paul Simon sponsored the Missing Children Act and the legislation establishing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He also wrote the National Literacy Act, the School to Work Opportunities Act and the Job Training Partnership Act amendments. He was a leader in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the establishment of the direct college loan program.Deeply dedicated to the community that sent him to represent their interests in Washington, Senator Simon held more town hall meetings than any other Illinois senator and his office was legendary for its constituent services.While in Congress, Paul Simon worked to enact legislation designating the first five federally chartered future high-speed rail corridors, which included the St. Louis-Chicago-Detroit/Milwaukee corridor, and to designate the Illinois-Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor. He was also instrumental in expanding the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, which is St. Louis's Gateway Arch National Park, to the State of Illinois.He possessed a rare knowledge and understanding of the legislative process and manifested an extraordinary energy for public policy-making.Senator Simon left us all way too soon. He lived a life dedicated to serving others, and he certainly left this world a better place for his time on Earth.,2015-03-17 19:09:56.201496,2015-03-17 19:09:56.201496,House,AGREEING WITH THE SENTIMENT OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PAUL SIMON,2004-01-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-01-21/html/CREC-2004-01-21-pt1-PgH52.htm,2,16,150,H52-H57,C001049,mr. clay
2410,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Doris Dunlap Darden, an educator who has devoted 50 years of service to the St. Louis Public School District. She has dedicated her life to enabling children to attain quality education and providing opportunities that help students realize their abilities and achieve their highest goals.She began her commendable teaching career in 1953 and has worked diligently to level the educational playing field for at-risk youth in low-income neighborhoods throughout the city of St. Louis. Darden has encouraged hundreds of children by setting high expectations and implementing programs for students to gain leadership and communications skills necessary to succeed in life. She has been committed to reaching both the students and their parents with her educational outreach. Darden impressively took the initiative to create ``Home, School and Community,'' a program which introduced students to local and national newsmakers and celebrities. This innovative program allows famous guest speakers to encourage students to achieve academic excellence, while their parents attended informative workshops and seminars.Darden solidly believes that all children deserve a high quality education regardless of their socioeconomic status. As a tutor, early in her career, she took note of the way wealthy parents trained their children and introduced those same learning techniques to inner city students. Darden found that her efforts helped raise both the productivity level and esteem of children who would otherwise might have been cast off by society.In addition to her unwavering commitment to teaching, Darden has selflessly allotted time for community service. She had dedicated numerous hours to working with the Colored Women's Association, National Association of University Women, Tot's N' Teens, various city-wide committees and Leadership for Teachers.Mr. Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Doris Dunlap Darden to today before Congress. This extraordinary women strongly believes that every child has the capacity to learn and deserves a chance to express that capacity through life goals. In 50 years, Darden has influentially touched the lives of thousands of young people in classrooms and throughout the St. Louis community. She has a stellar record of demonstrating compassion in the classroom. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring a treasured member of the St. Louis community, Doris Dunlap Darden.,2015-03-17 19:09:56.535734,2015-03-17 19:09:56.535734,Extensions,FOR THE LOVE OF TEACHING--A TRIBUTE TO REMARKABLE DORIS DUNLAP DARDEN,2003-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-02-25/html/CREC-2003-02-25-pt1-PgE283-2.htm,30,0,149,E283,C001049,mr. clay
2411,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I would like to commend the Guadalupe Center Inc. for their continued commitment to improving the life of Latinos throughout Kansas City, MO.The Guadalupe Center began as a volunteer school and well baby clinic for Mexican immigrants in Kansas City's Westside in 1919, becoming one of the Nation's first social service agencies for Latinos in the United States.Once working out of the rectory of Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine on West 23rd Street, the Guadalupe Center now has nine buildings and has expanded to serve the entire Kansas City Metropolitan Latino community.Today, the Center provides a number of essential services and is a leading advocate for the Latino community.Health programs at the center include substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS education and counseling. The center's diligent work in reaching this disproportionately affected Latino population is to be congratulated and encouraged.Also, the center has had a great deal of success with increasing employment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in the Latino community. This success goes hand in hand with the center's constantly expanding education programs, which provide participants with a number of opportunities, including second language GED and job training skills.Beyond reaching adult and young adults, the center also works to expand opportunities for children through its Plaza de Ninos preschool, which prepares young Latino children for early school success and helps them with the necessary English language skills, while providing childcare for working parents.The Guadalupe Center's activities and services, which continue to grow in number and impact, serve as an example of the center's vision and dedication for the Latino community.The future of Kansas City and the quality of life for its residents, especially the Latino community, depends on the decisions and the investments made today. The Guadalupe Center had taken the lead in making these strategic investments in Kansas City's urban core. Their efforts have improved the lives of the Latino community's children and families and the effects will be felt for generations to come.I look forward to partnering with the Guadalupe Center in future investments in Kansas City's Latino community. ,2015-03-17 19:09:56.790916,2015-03-17 19:09:56.790916,Senate,GUADALUPE CENTER FOR DEDICATION TO IMPROVING THE LIFE OF LATINO COMMUNITY,2003-04-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-28/html/CREC-2003-04-28-pt1-PgS5431-3.htm,61,0,149,S5431,B000611,mr. bond
2412,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will transfer the control of the Mingo Job Corps Center to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to be administered by the U.S. Forest Service. Since its inception, the Center has served at-risk youth by providing a facility where students can complete their secondary education and serve the local area through community service projects. The Department of Labor has expressed their plans to contract out operations of the Mingo Center, which is currently administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, an action that would greatly increase the chances for the permanent closure of the facility.The Mingo Job Corps Center has been extremely successful in southern Missouri. For over 40 years, the Center has been a place for students to complete their education, learn a trade, and serve the community. Through the Center, students master trades from auto repair to fire fighting, from carpentry to culinary arts, and from bricklaying to business. The closure of the facility would mean 250 students would not be able to receive their High School Diploma, GED, or learn the skills necessary to earn gainful employment.For over 40 years the Center has made a substantial contribution to the community through service projects. Mingo students have participated in national projects such as the recovery of the space shuttle Columbia and fighting western forest fires. However, the main impact of their activities are felt locally in southern Missouri. Each year the Mingo Job Corps completes over $1 million worth of community and conservation projects. These projects include construction of the Poplar Bluff Forest Service District Office, construction of many Puxico School buildings, and the painting and repair of furniture at various local schools.The Mingo Job Corps Training Center is truly an invaluable asset to the State of Missouri that must be preserved. Last year, with the help of Congresswomen Jo Ann Emerson, I secured a commitment from the USDA to have the Forest Service assume operation of the Mingo Job Corps Center. However, now it has become necessary for this transfer to be handled legislatively. My legislation will ensure that the Center will continue to be a positive force that shapes the lives of our youth. Our economy and the kids who depend upon this facility will remain the real winners here.,2015-03-17 19:09:57.248239,2015-03-17 19:09:57.248239,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2003-11-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-11-03/html/CREC-2003-11-03-pt1-PgS13803-2.htm,157,3,149,S13803-S13804,B000611,mr. bond
2413,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Madam President, today I am proud to introduce the Uterine Fibroids Research and Education Act 2002. This bipartisan legislation addresses a serious health problem that affects women during their reproductive years. At least twenty to thirty percent of all women aged 35 and older have symptomatic fibroids that require treatment. This number rises to approximately fifty percent for African-American women.I am pleased that two of my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Mikulski, are joining me in sponsoring this legislation. Both are strong advocates for women's health.Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that impact the reproductive health of women, particularly minority women. If they go undetected or untreated, uterine fibroids can lead to childbirth complications or infertility, among other things.For those who do seek treatment, the option prescribed most often is a hysterectomy. Uterine fibroids are the top reason for hysterectomies currently being performed in this country. A hysterectomy is a major operation--the average recovery time is six weeks. This is just the physical impact, the emotional impact lasts much longer.We need to invest additional resources in research, so that there are more treatment options for women, including options less drastic than a hysterectomy. We also need to increase awareness of uterine fibroids, so that more women will recognize the symptoms and seek treatment.To accomplish both of these goals we need a sustained Federal commitment to better understanding uterine fibroids. That is why I am introducing this legislation today.My bill has two components. First, it authorizes $10 million for the National Institutes of Health, (NIH), for each of our years to conduct research on uterine fibroids.Second, the bill supports a public awareness campaign. It calls on the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to carry out a program to provide information and education to the public regarding uterine fibroids. The content of the program shall include information on the incidence and prevalence of uterine fibroids and the elevated risk for minority women. The Secretary shall have the authority to carry out the program either directly or through contract. By Mr. INOUYE:S. 2127.

The team took top honors for their multi-media presentation detailing their year's accomplishments.Drury's SIFE team devoted more than 7,000 hours to 35 educational and community service projects. All of the projects were designed to develop leadership and communication skills through free enterprise education. Besides receiving excellent practical experience in business skills, the students were also investing themselves in their local and national communities.Among their almost three dozen projects this year the team continued to develop and expand the Young Entrepreneurs Association, a web-based organization devoted to free enterprise education for middle school teachers and students. Only three years old, the program now serves 510 middle schools, representing 17 countries and all 50 states.The Team also built on a three year relationship with an ``at-risk'' middle school in Laredo Texas and this year conducted a three day educational program built around the principles of free enterprise, ethical marketing and entrepreneurship. The project culminated with a ``mercado,'' in which 800 customers purchased products designed and produced by the middle school students.Their win qualifies them for the first SIFE World Cup, to be held in London on July 11-13. Teams from 23 nations will compete for the title of SIFE Global Champion.SIFE is a grassroots student movement active on more than 1,000 college and university campuses in 48 states and 20 foreign countries.

In 1998, the Santa Barbara News Press honored him with its Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1999, the John Templeton Foundation selected him as one of 50 college presidents who have exercised leadership in character development.But most important of all, David Winter's real impact cannot be measured by awards and titles. His real impact has been on the thousands of students who have attended Westmont in the last twenty-five years. He has spearheaded the effort on the part of the entire Westmont Community to provide a thorough liberal arts education with a Christian foundation. His leadership and firm faith have led Westmont into the 21st Century as the Westmont community continues to turn out young people who are committed to being good citizens of the United States and the world. I want to wish David and his wife and partner in leading Westmont, Helene, the best as they enter this new phase of their life together.,2015-03-17 19:09:58.603203,2015-03-17 19:09:58.603203,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DAVID K.

2418,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), for yielding me this time.Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1291, the 21st Century Montgomery GI Bill Enhancement Act. As a co-sponsor of the bill, I urge its passage. This legislation continues our efforts to improve the education program for our men and women in uniform. The bill provides an increase in benefits, including raising the monthly educational stipend to $800 a month for fiscal year 2002, to $1,100 by fiscal year 2004.I remember well the beginnings of what was later known to be the Montgomery GI bill. It was shared between the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the House Committee on Armed Services, and I remember playing a part in making sure that it reached the floor at that time.The gentleman from Mississippi, the Honorable Sonny Montgomery, was the author, is the author; and we should remember his efforts as we improve on that bill today.This legislation is the right step toward enhancing this bill for our veterans. We must continue to take advantage of opportunities to provide our veterans a truly meaningful and substantial educational program.Full funding for tuition and fees and a monthly stipend for living expenses in exchange for a service commitment would dramatically improve the GI program and would bring parity with other scholarship and tuition assistance programs currently available to young Americans. Efforts by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) to build upon improvements under the Montgomery GI bill will greatly improve this education program for our men and women in uniform, and I hope that his efforts on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will continue and that they will be able to pass additional educational benefits, as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) so desires.Now while it is important that the House consider this legislation, the process by which it is brought to the floor concerns me. It is deeply disturbing that no member of the Subcommittee on Benefits or of the full Committee on Veterans' Affairs has been given the opportunity to engage in a full and open debate on this measure or vote on the bill before today.I hope procedural abuses like this do not occur again, because it is not fair, either to the Members of this body or to the veterans for whom it is intended to benefit.,2015-03-17 19:09:59.847086,2015-03-17 19:09:59.847086,House,21ST CENTURY MONTGOMERY GI BILL ENHANCEMENT ACT,2001-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-06-19/html/CREC-2001-06-19-pt1-PgH3212-5.htm,85,9,147,H3212-H3220,S000465,mr. skelton
2419,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an institution which for a quarter of a century has served an invaluable role in preserving and remembering our Southwest Missouri history and heritage.Twenty-five years ago The History Museum of Springfield and Greene County was created in honor of the Bicentennial of our great nation. The citizens of Springfield and Greene County established the museum to educate others about the area's culture and open a new window on the history of day-to-day life in the region. A key local education resource was born.Teachers and other educators in Southwest Missouri have been blessed to have such a historical museum readily available. Over the years it has become a favorite field trip destination, permitting thousands of young minds to experience some of the culture that nurtured their parents and grandparents as well as other generations before them. Many educational trips have been hosted by The History Museum for Springfield and Greene County. The Museum, founded and guided in its early years by Springfieldian Kitty Lipscomb, is also a place of remembering and learning for adults too.The museum is a storehouse of knowledge about past experiences which helped shape our families, neighborhoods and communities and are still molding us as a society today. It reveals the common threads that bound neighborhoods and communities together in past generations. Capitalism, Democracy, Liberty and Faith were the core values that stirred our imagination and gave birth to America's work ethic, innovation, and self betterment through a commitment to education, and personal independence. Each of these qualities is on display at the History Museum for Springfield and Greene County in vintage photographs, clothing displays, maps and documents depicting how our communities grew and developed. With its home on the top floor of the Springfield City Hall, the Museum has dedicated itself to the reflection of our past with an eye toward our future.This superb facility gives us the opportunity to memorialize our own stories of accomplishment, development and expansion as well as documenting how we overcame challenges and disagreements. Individuals, neighborhoods, community leaders and institutions joined together to forge a strong, diverse economy and society in the Ozarks.I'm confident that my Colleagues join with me in expressing our thanks to the vision and foresight of community leaders a quarter century ago. Because of their dedicated work, the residents of Southwest Missouri have had a place where they can go to rediscover the roots of our past and benefit from lessons for the future.,2015-03-17 19:10:00.285398,2015-03-17 19:10:00.285398,Extensions,THE HISTORY MUSEUM OF SPRINGFIELD AND GREENE COUNTY,2001-09-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-09-10/html/CREC-2001-09-10-pt1-PgE1616-4.htm,116,0,147,E1616-E1617,B000575,mr. blunt
2420,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. One of the things that we all worked for and voted for last year right here on the House floor was a resolution that did exactly what you and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra) and others want to do and the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Thune) was mentioning with education. I know the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) was an advocate of this. That was, let us get what money we spend where it does the most good. Let us be focused on education, not focused on bureaucrats. This is the right kind of solution that we need.I think 310 Members of the House, which means that lots of Democrats joined virtually all the Republicans, and we passed a resolution that said that 90 cents out of every dollar in every Federal elementary and secondary program needed to get to the classroom, the Dollars to the Classroom Act. And suddenly we are reducing all that money that is used up by bureaucrats, all that money that is used up by people figuring out new forms to fill out and by people that have to fill out those forms and by people that monitor those forms. We are saying, let us get that money to where it will do some good.Let us be sure that we do not waste $1,800 for every classroom in America every year, like we are doing now when we are getting about 65 cents out of every dollar in the classroom. Let us get 90 cents out of every dollar in the classroom. Let us let parents be involved in that decision. Let us let local building administrators be involved in spending that money. But mostly let us let teachers and kids get together. Let us put that money not in the hands of some bureaucrats in Washington, or even in all of our State capitals, let us put that money in the hands of a teacher who knows every child's name in that class. That can make a difference.,2015-03-17 19:10:00.436506,2015-03-17 19:10:00.436506,House,EXPLAINING THE ATTITUDES, CONCERNS, AND BELIEFS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS,1998-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-04/html/CREC-1998-03-04-pt1-PgH841-2.htm,20,18,144,H841-H848,B000575,mr. blunt
2421,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to say a few words in tribute to John Ryland Edwards, a superb soldier and educator, who is retiring after 22 years of service to Wentworth Military Academy.Born in Lexington, MO, John Edwards graduated from the University of Missouri with a BS in Education. In 1955, he became a teacher and coach at Henrietta, MO, High School, but joined the United States Army one year later. From 1956 to 1976, Mr. Edwards served his country in the U.S. Army while stationed in Texas, Alaska, Colorado, Indiana, Washington, DC, Vietnam, and Okinawa. During his tenure in the Army, he worked as an Adjutant General Corps Sports Director, an Assistant Army Service Officer, a Special Service Officer, an Administrative Officer, a Recreational Services Officer, an Adjutant General, the Director of Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Office, Army Project Officer for the Presidential Reception honoring Vietnam veterans, Director of U.S. Army Sports Program, Officer in Charge of U.S. Armed Forces basketball team, and the Army Representative to the 1976 Olympics. John Edwards retired from active duty in 1976, with the Legion of Merit award, a Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal (with Oak Leaf Cluster), Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal (with two Oak Leaf Clusters), National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.Following his active duty career, John Edwards moved back to his hometown of Lexington, MO, to serve at Wentworth Military Academy. During his 22-year tenure at Wentworth, John served as Operations Officer, Special Events Coordinator, Project Officer, Athletic Director and basketball coach, Alumni Director, Adult Education Director, and Interim Superintendent. John has provided superior leadership at Wentworth, and has worked with every department on campus. He served as the man behind the scenes who made every event work with precision.In addition to his military career, John Edwards has participated in many community activities. He is a member of the Lexington, MO, Lions Club, Lafayette Regional Health Center Board of Trustees, Lexington Area Chamber of Commerce Board (serving as President for one term), Lafayette County Health Department Board, and Member of Turners. He has received the Melvin Jones Fellow Award and Lion of the Year Award, as well as the Lexington Outstanding Leadership Award.Mr. Speaker, I am certain that my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to John Ryland Edwards, an outstanding Missourian. His career in the United States Army and at Wentworth Military Academy, combined with superb community service, make him a role model for young military and civic leaders.,2015-03-17 19:10:00.581609,2015-03-17 19:10:00.581609,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO JOHN RYLAND EDWARDS,1998-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-30/html/CREC-1998-04-30-pt1-PgE720-2.htm,51,0,144,E720,S000465,mr. skelton
2422,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for yielding me this time.Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this voucher bill because it will do absolutely nothing to improve the quality of educational opportunities available in the District of Columbia. What this bill will do, however, is create false hope in the minds of schoolchildren and their parents and allow the Republicans to trumpet a lot of their baseless partisan political themes.Let me say to my Republican colleagues and the District residents that federally funded school vouchers will not be made available here or anywhere else in America during the 105th Congress.Madam Speaker, this is the third time that Republicans have trotted out this misguided D.C. voucher proposal for consideration in the House. Twice before they unsuccessfully attempted to attach it to the D.C. Appropriations bill. Now, the proposal finally stands alone to be judged on its own. It has never gone through the committee process for deliberate consideration. If it had, it would not have seen the light of day.Just, last November, a bipartisan majority of this body soundly rejected legislation to offer federally funded vouchers nationwide. Why? Because Members recognized that vouchers simply channel taxpayer dollars to private and religious schools--something ridiculous to do when budget pressure makes it difficult to properly fund public schools. Members also recognized that the bill would erode protections afforded through our civil rights laws. The voucher proposal before us today suffers from the very same fatal flaws. What's more, the D.C. voucher bill would be vetoed if it were sent to the President.Madam Speaker, we should not undermine the efforts of those local officials who are principally responsible for the education of District students by forcing upon them the failed and unconstitutional voucher experiment. Rather, what we should do is support the Norton substitute to provide the D.C. public schools with $7 million to implement comprehensive reforms and hire additional reading tutors. Both initiatives would target the lowest performing schools. This approach would ensure all D.C. students the promise of a quality education from what would soon become an exemplary public school system.,2015-03-17 19:10:00.735718,2015-03-17 19:10:00.735718,House,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP ACT OF 1997,1998-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-30/html/CREC-1998-04-30-pt1-PgH2651.htm,51,5,144,H2651-H2660,C000488,mr. clay
2423,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the Republican rule on the National Endowment for the Arts and in support of full funding for the NEA. We must make this commitment not only to fulfill our Nation's cultural life but also to nourish the local economic development efforts which rise from our investments in the arts.I hope that the majority of the House will eventually support funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, but we can only get there by crossing an obstacle course put in place by the Republican leadership. Their Byzantine maneuvering on this rule is a waste of the House's precious time.Support for NEA is more than just about the love of art or high-minded support of cultural endeavors. It is about supporting the efforts of State and local governments to create economic growth. The NEA's funding goes to projects which increase economic opportunity by promoting the cultural and artistic activities of local citizens. The arts enhance a community's quality of life, thereby attracting industry, jobs, and increasing the tax base. Investment in the arts is both economically prudent and wise.Federal funds are leveraged by localities to bring about a bigger bang for the NEA buck. The $98 million invested in the NEA by the Federal Government stimulated State and local governments to provide more than $975 million to the arts. This is big business: The nonprofit arts industry generates $36 billion of business annually and supports 1.3 million full-time jobs.And the NEA benefits rural as well as urban areas. The NEA's partnerships foster rural community revitalization, downtown development, and historic revitalization. The cultural traditions of local communities can serve as a strategy for economic development of economically depressed rural communities.Also, funding for the NEA is about supporting a full and rich education for our children. In 1997, 10 percent of its annual grant dollars were spent in support of pre-K through 12 arts education programs. NEA grants are used to provide educational opportunities for millions of children to learn and be enriched by the arts, opportunities that would not exist without the NEA.So we need to fund the NEA to make sure that we nurture the artistic capabilities of all Americans. Funding for the NEA is a small investment in the spiritual and intellectual health of our country. It has and will continue to pay great dividends for our Nation, far beyond its modest cost.I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and support full funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.,2015-03-17 19:10:00.891830,2015-03-17 19:10:00.891830,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4193, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999,1998-07-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-21/html/CREC-1998-07-21-pt1-PgH5972.htm,98,14,144,H5972-H5980,G000132,mr. gephardt
2424,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to express good luck to our colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Fawell, who is retiring from the House at the end of this Congress. It has been my privilege to serve with Mr. Fawell on the Committee on Education and the Workforce throughout Mr. Fawell's congressional career. During that time we have more often taken opposing points of view regarding legislation, particularly legislation affecting the labor laws. However, our differences have been political, never personal. Further, though our views may have differed on most issues, those differences have not prevented us from working together when we have been able to find common ground. When we have found common ground, we have successfully enacted good legislation.In the last Congress, I joined with Mr. Fawell in support of legislation to provide an exemption for police and fire departments from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In this Congress, I supported the efforts of Mr. Fawell, and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Payne, to enact the Saver Act. I also participated in the national summit on retirement savings that the Saver Act created. I believe both the first summit and the subsequent summits that will occur as a result of enactment of the Saver Act will serve to better educate workers regarding the importance of retirement savings. As a result, more workers will have financially secure retirements.I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Fawell for his work on the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act. Recently enacted as part of the Higher Education Act, this law permits certain voluntary retirement incentive plans for college faculty. I was not initially a supporter of this legislation. However, Mr. Fawell worked diligently to address concerns raised by myself and others and the final product is one in which we all, and especially Mr. Fawell, may be proud.Mr. Fawell first came to Congress in 1985, following the retirement of John Erlenborn. Mr. Erlenborn had a substantial reputation in this body as both a leader for conservative positions on labor issues and for his role in the enactment and subsequent development of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Many thought Mr. Erlenborn's shoes would be difficult to fill. But let me say for the record that, from my perspective, Harris, you fully filled the shoes of your distinguished predecessor. I wish the best for you and your family in the years ahead.,2015-03-17 19:10:01.046939,2015-03-17 19:10:01.046939,House,TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN HARRIS FAWELL,1998-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-06/html/CREC-1998-10-06-pt1-PgH9654.htm,138,21,144,H9654-H9659,C000488,mr. clay
2425,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.Mr. Chairman, I, too, am a grandfather. I have three grandchildren in public schools, and I am concerned about them as well as any other grandparent.But I was lost by the logic or illogic of the last statement made about compassion for a seventh grader who is in an unsafe environment and that parent being able to take that child out of that unsafe environment and put that child in a safe environment.I would think that to take one child out of an unsafe environment and leave the rest of the children in that unsafe environment does not make much sense. I would think one would take the disruptive children, the ones who are causing the unsafe environment, out of that situation and leave all of the children in a safe environment.I, too, am a grandparent. I have many reasons why I oppose this amendment. The Committee on Education and the Workforce deliberated at length on the issue of private school vouchers. Then we voted overwhelmingly in committee to reject that concept.Second, if this amendment were adopted, it would destroy the bipartisanship we developed on this bill during the last 12 or 14 months. It would also jeopardize all the progress that we are making in improving Title I.Beyond that, Mr. Chairman, this is a reckless amendment that would divert funds from poor public schools to parochial schools. It provides no oversight of the quality of education provided with Federal funds, which is the opposite of what we are doing in the rest of this bill.Also, Federal funding of private school vouchers raises serious constitutional issues that could jeopardize the independence of religious schools and disrupt the administration of Title I programs.Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill would have a very discriminatory effect. Those students who get private school vouchers can receive up to $3,500 in vouchers, which is substantially more than per pupil allocation for current Title I students who are in the public schools.So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:10:01.203051,2015-03-17 19:10:01.203051,House,STUDENT RESULTS ACT OF 1999,1999-10-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-21/html/CREC-1999-10-21-pt1-PgH10621-3.htm,144,6,145,H10621-H10656,C000488,mr. clay
2426,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dr. C. Pat Taylor, who has served as president of Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, for the last 15 years, making him the longest serving president in the 133-year history of the school. Dr. Taylor already had an impressive record in higher education before coming to SBU in 1996. In the last 15 years he has added to that record of accomplishment and earned respect for his leadership and dedication to the students and community at Southwest Baptist University.Southwest Baptist University is a very special place to me. I earned my undergraduate degree there and 20 years later served 4 years as its President. Dr. Taylor is my successor, and I have enjoyed watching the university grow and get even better under his leadership.During his remarkable tenure at SBU:Dr. Taylor has presented a record 11,881 degrees since 1996.SBU has Missouri's third largest nursing degree program on its Springfield campus.The number of student missionaries sent out in North American has doubled to more than 400 in the last decade, and Dr. Taylor hopes to see that continue to increase. Student enrollment peaked at more than 3700 in the fall of 2009 and remains at 3,576 this semester.The Partner in Excellence campaign between 1999 and 2005 raised a record $62 million to fund 13 major building projects for the arts, instructional technology and extended learning, sports and athletics, religious education, and campus parking.The SBU endowment more than doubled during the last decade to over $19 million.The school's first doctoral program was launched, and the number of physical therapy applications has grown each year.``It's all God's blessing,'' Dr. Taylor has explained. ``We've worked hard, but God has blessed it. It's not what we've done, but it's what God has done through us. When I really look at our success, it's because God has ordained that we will be successful.''I could not agree with Dr. Taylor more. I would add that Dr. Taylor is a blessing to Southwest Baptist University and the community. It is my hope that Southwest Baptist University continues to meet its mission as a ``Christ-centered, caring academic community preparing students to be servant leaders in a global society.'' It is a bold calling, and I am certain SBU has the leadership and dedication in Dr. Taylor to see it fulfilled. ,2015-03-17 19:10:01.336140,2015-03-17 19:10:01.336140,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2011-09-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-09-26/html/CREC-2011-09-26-pt1-PgS5991-3.htm,144,0,157,S5991-S5992,B000575,mr. blunt

The Outstanding Public Service Award is the second highest honor given by the Chairman to a public servant who ``has rendered service or assistance to considerable personal sacrifice, motivated by patriotism, good citizenship and a sense of public responsibility.''Sgt. Sewell enlisted in the United States Air Force on January 23, 2003, and was assigned to Spangdahlem Airbase, Germany, as a Munitions Systems Inspector. During his service, he was deployed to Afghanistan with the 52nd Fighter Wing in support of the unit's A-10, which assisted in the first elections held in Afghanistan. He completed his military service in August of 2007 with the 509th Bomb Wing at Whitman Air Force Base, Missouri. Currently, Mr. Sewell is a Staff Sergeant with the Missouri Air National Guard with the 131st Bomb Wing in Whiteman Air Force Base.Sgt. Sewell received a bachelor's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Missouri. He's currently working toward the completion of his master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Missouri. Mr. Sewell was the president of the student veteran's group at the University of Missouri, and he led the organization in efforts to establish the first on-campus Veteran's Center in the country. The Veteran's Center provides a ``one-stop'' resource center for our veterans on campus, which assists the veteran with all student veteran needs. He continues to find ways to assist veterans by teaching a class called ``Learning and Transition Strategies for Veterans.'' The goal is for veterans to have a successful transition from military life back to academic life.Sgt. Sewell continues to find ways to help veterans by being an advocate. He was the advocate for the review of military transfer credits. This led to hundreds of veterans receiving academic credit for their applicable military education and training. He manages and coordinates with the Student Veteran Volunteer network, which helps veterans working toward their higher education on a national level.In closing, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Sgt.

2432,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it has come to my attention that John Hoskins has recently retired as the Director of Missouri's Department of Conservation after a career in conservation that spans more than three decades. A steadfast steward of Missouri's beautiful natural resources, Mr. Hoskins has spent his life protecting our environment so that future generations may enjoy Missouri's God-given beauty.A lifelong Missourian, Mr. Hoskins grew up on a small Ozark farm where he learned the value of a clean environment and the special connection we enjoy with our natural surroundings. After graduating with a bachelor's degree from Southeast Missouri State University in 1975, he went on to complete a Master of Public Administration degree at my alma mater, the University of Missouri.Throughout his tenure with the department, Mr. Hoskins has balanced competing priorities with a fixed budget. Under his leadership, the department has expanded conservation education facilities across the state and created new school programs to teach young Missourians the importance of caring for our precious natural resources.On a personal note, the magazine of the Department of Conservation, the Missouri Conservationist, has been a mainstay of my office for many years now. My fellow Missourians and I have long enjoyed the magazine's interesting articles and the beautiful pictures of Missouri's great outdoors.Madam Speaker, I trust my fellow members of the House will join me in recognizing John Hoskins, a man who has dedicated his life to the effective stewardship of Missouri's environment.,2015-03-17 19:10:02.296829,2015-03-17 19:10:02.296829,Extensions,ON THE RETIREMENT OF JOHN HOSKINS,2010-02-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-04/html/CREC-2010-02-04-pt1-PgE164-2.htm,17,0,156,E164,S000465,mr. skelton

2436,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, 8 years of failed economic policies under the Bush administration left a deep economic hole for the new Obama administration, but three things are clear: It will take some time to dig out; we have made steady progress; and there is much more to do.But yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released its report showing progress with new jobs created and decreasing unemployment in my home State of Missouri. Now is not the time to reverse direction. We must remain focused on the real measure of recovery, and that's jobs. We need to move beyond bickering to real solutions that will put real people back to work.I urge my colleagues to once again take up the job-creating America COMPETES bill that would strengthen U.S. scientific and economic leadership, support employers, and create jobs through investments in science, innovation, and education.We can't let partisan gridlock hold us back while countries pass us by to invent, build, and sell us the technology that will power the next century.

Each devoted over four hundred hours of voluntary public service to St. Louis Irish Arts, where they taught and performed traditional Irish dance for the benefit of people of all ages.As is required for the Congressional Award, each of these young women also completed an expedition of personal discovery, traveling to Ireland to become immersed in a different culture and study Irish music.Natasha and Abigail have both demonstrated a passion for self-discovery through the examination of traditional Irish culture, and extended that passion to the education and betterment of others within their community.Young people such as these show a promising future for the United States, and I am proud and honored to have such individuals in the Third Congressional District of the great state of Missouri.

2438,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of Rev. Doctor Samuel E. Mann, an individual who has dedicated his life to helping the underserved in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, the District that I am honored to represent. This weekend, Reverend Mann is retiring, after 40 years as Pastor Administrator of St. Mark Union Church and executive director of United Inner City Services. In that capacity, he oversaw a budget of $1.5 million annually, a sixty-two member staff and programs that included: child and family development, social services, and community development and street organizations and violence prevention.He is a native of Eufaula, Alabama and a graduate of Birmingham Southern College, BA; Duke Divinity School, M. Div., and St. Paul School of Theology, D. Min. He is married to Dr. Beverlye J. Brown, and is the father of three children and grandfather of seven.Remarkably, Rev. Mann was a local preacher at the age of 15 years old at the First Methodist Church of Eufaula, Alabama; he was later the Associate Pastor of St. John United Methodist Church of Kansas City, Missouri, and sometime later, the Pastor of the First Methodist Church of Peculiar, MO, and Director of the Young Adult Projects, Inc. Rev. Mann was dismissed from both churches because of his views on race and peace.As a long-time civil rights activist, Rev. Mann marched in numerous demonstrations, including the march for the garbage workers in Memphis, Tennessee, the march against the war in Vietnam, led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and was part of the U.S. delegation that visited with South Africa ANC leader Dr. Nelson Mandela shortly after his release from prison. Dr. Mann has also been jailed on several occasions for his participation in these activities. He served as a key participant in the national effort to respond to the burning of black churches in America. He has traveled to Nicaragua and China for various humanitarian efforts.Rev. Mann was instrumental in the formation of Operation Break and Build, a street outreach organization that evolved out of the Urban Peace and Justice Summit in 1994. Its purpose was to assist street organizations, gangs, with transforming their lives via crisis intervention, education, economic development, addressing women's issues, and criminal justice.He has been the recipient of many awards, including the NAACP Harold Holiday Award; the John M. Swomley Human Rights Award, the Elder Statesmen of Kansas City award, the MO Jazz award, the Sam Eason Award presented by Niles Home; the Black Archives of Mid-America award; the Beta Omega PSI PHI Fraternity Inc.'s Citizen of the Year Award; and many, many more. He is co-founder of the project ``Reframing the Dialogue on Race in America.'' Through this national project, he attempts to address the problem of race by focusing on the issues of white supremacy and white privilege. Through training, he seeks to inspire ministries to address racism in their congregations.His most recent project was the building of the $4 million child care center, the St. Mark Child & Family Development Center, located at 2008 E. 12th Street in Kansas City, Missouri. St. Mark's is a state of the art child care facility that annually serves approximately 225 low-income families through its early childhood education program, before- and after-school program, and summer camp. Nearly 100 percent of the children are African American, with many living in single parent households in one of Kansas City, Missouri's poorest neighborhoods.Rev. Mann is presently a leader working in concert with other agencies in making Kansas City a Zone Seven site to provide additional services in the urban core for the education of children. I am proud of the federal funding I helped secure for St. Mark.Madam Speaker, it is an honor and privilege for me to recognize my friend, and colleague, the Reverend Doctor Sam Mann for his efforts to improve the education and quality of life in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. It is with great pride that we honor Reverend Doctor Mann today for his commitment to the residents of Missouri. On behalf of the people of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, I wish this thunderous preacher and fearless prophet a well-deserved retirement.,2015-03-17 19:10:03.186461,2015-03-17 19:10:03.186461,Extensions,RECOGNIZING REVEREND DOCTOR SAM E.

2442,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,I rise today and join the Epilepsy Foundation in calling for Americans to Get Seizure Smart! Epilepsy awareness is critically important because Americans need a better understanding about the basics of the condition. For instance, people often characterize seizures as jerking and shaking uncontrollably. However, not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many different symptoms of seizures, which can include eye fluttering, staring and laughing. Recurring seizures can be a sign of epilepsy.Epilepsy awareness is critically important for public servants too. Because first responders are often called when someone is having a seizure, it's critical they have good information on which to act. And because epilepsy is common in children, educators, administrators and parents need to know how to respond in an emergency.For 40 years, the Epilepsy Foundation has been raising awareness and reducing the stigma associating with this condition. Specifically, I commend the Epilepsy Foundation of Missouri and Kansas in their efforts to ensure that people living with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences. They are working to prevent, control, and cure epilepsy through research, education, advocacy, and services.I urge my colleagues to Get Seizure Smart! to help dispel the myths associated with epilepsy and empower those millions of Americans affected by this condition. We must work together to learn more about epilepsy and connect with our local Epilepsy Foundation to raise awareness in our communities.,2015-03-17 19:10:03.797899,2015-03-17 19:10:03.797899,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL EPILEPSY MONTH,2010-12-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-12-02/html/CREC-2010-12-02-pt1-PgE2035-2.htm,156,0,156,E2035,C001060,mr. carnahan
2443,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, there is a condition in this country that affects more than 3 million people and sees 200,000 new cases every year; 25 percent are children. It's epilepsy. It's the third most common neurological disorder after Alzheimer's and stroke. The cause is unknown in two-thirds of epilepsy cases. It can develop at any age. It can be a result of genetics, stroke, head injury, and other factors.Earlier this year, I met a spirited 9-year-old from my district. Since the age of 7, Chad has been living with epilepsy and faces daunting challenges in school because of various misconceptions. Despite major progress in diagnosis and treatment, epilepsy is often misunderstood and overlooked. Contrary to belief, it is not contagious. Some believe epilepsy is curable with medication or treatment when, in fact, over 30 percent of patients suffer uncontrollable seizures despite treatment.This is why raising awareness is so important. It will dispel myths and empower millions affected by this condition. I urge my colleagues to support further research, awareness, and education as we work together to find a cure for epilepsy.,2015-03-17 19:10:03.941019,2015-03-17 19:10:03.941019,House,NATIONAL EPILEPSY AWARENESS,2009-12-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-12-02/html/CREC-2009-12-02-pt1-PgH13391-5.htm,177,1,155,H13391,C001060,mr. carnahan

This is not an ongoing effort in every single country, whether Colombia might have graduated, Nicaragua, and other countries.But, you know, with so many threats against our Nation, I just think it's important to share America's bounty with hungry children in other places and in critical places around the world so that we can help America feed their hungry bodies out of goodness.And it really is something that the entire Defense Department--you ask any Army officer or any member of the armed services, when they are in areas where these children's lives are being changed by a bowl of mush, as Mr. McGovern said, it makes a huge difference. It makes them able to go to school.

These women exemplify that a woman can do any job a man can do. As we saw during the Presidential election, women like Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed Americans that women are ready to lead.My daughter, Rebecca, turned in her fourth grade biography report on Susan B. Anthony this week. She and I learned together about the right to vote and equal access to education for women that she fought for so valiantly but never lived to see. As the mother of two young daughters, it is so important to me that they see strong women taking the lead to repair our world.As we look to the future and the steps that must be taken to save our planet, women can and will take the lead.,2015-03-17 19:10:05.296955,2015-03-17 19:10:05.296955,House,SUPPORTING NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH,2009-03-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-17/html/CREC-2009-03-17-pt1-PgH3453.htm,46,23,155,H3453-H3456,C001049,mr. clay

It serves a four-State area as a center for commerce, education, health care, and transportation.Gary Shaw has spent several years in service to the city of Joplin, and I am thankful for Reverend Shaw's committed efforts to the city as a member of several committees and leadership boards. His work to improve business, safety, and historic preservation in his community and State does not go unnoticed.He's a devoted father and husband.

A veteran of the United States Army, a graduate of Ozark Christian College in Joplin, Reverend Shaw has also been a witness for his faith in over 30 countries.It's truly my honor to welcome Reverend Shaw to the House today and thank him for his service to Missouri and many years of dedicated service to the city of Joplin.,2015-03-17 19:10:05.419047,2015-03-17 19:10:05.419047,House,WELCOMING REVEREND GARY SHAW,2009-03-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-26/html/CREC-2009-03-26-pt1-PgH4029-4.htm,52,2,155,H4029,B000575,mr. blunt
2453,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, the fallout from the failed policies of the last 8 years will take time to turn around.The Bush administration inherited a record surplus of $5.6 trillion, and turned it into a record deficit of $5.8 trillion. President Obama's budget is a long-term plan to turn the economy around and transform it for future prosperity, with targeted investments in health care, energy, and education. The plan takes steps to reduce health care costs, one of the largest contributors to the deficit and a growing burden on American businesses like the auto industry. The budget includes $2 trillion worth of savings, ending the war in Iraq, cutting programs that are not effective, and ending tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas.My constituents who are struggling to make ends meet continue to urge me to support this budget. The American people understand this commonsense blueprint for change is exactly what we need for these challenging times. They understand it cuts taxes for 95 percent of Americans, cuts wasteful spending, cuts the deficit in half over 4 years. What this budget grows is jobs.

2455,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, last week, the House passed House Resolution 492, recognizing this week as High-Performance Building Week. The resolution aims to provide greater public awareness about the benefits of high-performance buildings, and it works to increase education about the impact buildings have on our environment.Each year, our homes, offices, schools, and other buildings consume 70 percent of our electricity, 60 percent of all raw materials, and they emit 40 percent of all CO emissions in the U.S. By designing and building high-performance buildings, we reduce energy consumption and our carbon footprint. We save both water and raw materials. We save demolition and construction debris from going into landfills. Most importantly, high-performance building construction creates good-paying jobs that give workers the valuable skills they need to excel in a clean energy economy.2It is my hope that Members will use this week to highlight the importance that buildings have on our environment and for Congress to continue to support future research, development and the deployment of high-performance building technologies.,2015-03-17 19:10:05.886380,2015-03-17 19:10:05.886380,House,RECOGNIZING THIS WEEK AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE BUILDING WEEK,2009-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-06-15/html/CREC-2009-06-15-pt1-PgH6748-7.htm,89,1,155,H6748,C001060,mr. carnahan

Ryan had had a seizure. Ryan went on to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, where he majored in political science. At Westminster, Ryan remained politically active, became vice president of the Student Government Association, and was elected Homecoming King during the fall of his senior year. All the while, he hid his epilepsy from his peers.Epilepsy is one of the most common disorders of the nervous system. It affects people of all ages, races, and ethnic backgrounds. More than 3 million Americans of all ages are living with epilepsy, and every year, 200,000 Americans will develop seizures and epilepsy for the first time. Epilepsy can develop at any time of life, especially in early childhood and old age. It's a neurological condition that makes people susceptible to seizures.Ryan is now 25 and serves as a congressional aide. He hopes to use his experiences and influence to raise awareness. As November is designated National Epilepsy Awareness Month, I am honored to help Ryan promote his message for increased research, awareness, and education to openly work toward a cure.,2015-03-17 19:10:06.631916,2015-03-17 19:10:06.631916,House,HONORING RYAN DILLON DURING NATIONAL EPILEPSY AWARENESS MONTH,2009-11-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-11-18/html/CREC-2009-11-18-pt1-PgH13115-4.htm,171,1,155,H13115,E000172,mrs. emerson

2470,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Madam President, we have successfully added this amendment to all appropriations bills to date. It is a very simple amendment. It requires the Departments under this bill to maintain a direct link to the agency's inspector general Web site, on the home page of his or her department's Web site. It requires this direct link because the information the inspector general provides to the public needs to be easily available. They are the eyes and ears of the taxpayers in many ways. They are on the front lines in terms of waste, fraud, and abuse. They provide a valuable service. In many departments, one can't find the information. This amendment will require that on the home page of the Web sites of the Departments of Education, Labor Health and Human Services, there be a direct link to the inspector general of that Department's Web site so taxpayers, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch can easily find the important information that is provided by the inspector general's office.I urge passage of the amendment.,2015-03-17 19:10:08.290083,2015-03-17 19:10:08.290083,Senate,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008, Continued,2007-10-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-10-17/html/CREC-2007-10-17-pt1-PgS12962-2.htm,157,133,153,S12962-S12980,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

I always take pleasure in giving reasons for why I am a member of the Democratic Party.Since taking control of Congress, Democrats have worked to pass legislation that will help families once again live the American Dream. Over the last 6 years, college costs have shot up 40 percent, putting higher education out of reach for most Americans. I have one son in college today, and I can tell you I am excited over the fact that we passed, and the President did, in fact, sign the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This law is the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill. It strengthens the middle class by cutting interest rates in half and subsidizes student loans over the next 5 years. We are also able, in this bill, to increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarships by $500.Madam Speaker, I am pleased and I am excited to be a Democrat.,2015-03-17 19:10:08.511239,2015-03-17 19:10:08.511239,House,DEMOCRATS TRYING TO EASE THE PAIN OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BY MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE,2007-10-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-10-23/html/CREC-2007-10-23-pt1-PgH11850-9.htm,161,1,153,H11850,C001061,mr. cleaver

Included are nearly $8 billion in new charges that will raise the cost of college loans through new fees and higher interest for millions of American students and families.For the typical student borrower already saddled with over $17,000 in debt, these new fees and higher interest charges will cost up to $5,800 more.Financial barriers should never prevent a qualified student from going to college, and that is why America has long since made the commitment to help all Americans afford a higher education. Studies show that financial barriers alone will prevent over 4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public university over the next decade and prevent another 2 million from attending college at all.Mr. Speaker, the wrong priorities in this Republican budget reconciliation will put college out of reach for millions of American students. It should be rejected.,2015-03-17 19:10:10.731818,2015-03-17 19:10:10.731818,House,REPUBLICAN RAID ON STUDENT AID SHOWS MISGUIDED PRIORITIES,2005-11-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-11-08/html/CREC-2005-11-08-pt1-PgH9968-5.htm,147,1,151,H9968,C001060,mr. carnahan
2487,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,I thank my friend for yielding. This is an important topic for us to deal with. Pension security is incredibly important to Americans and their future.We believe we have a good bill from the Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Workforce Committee that has been put together. But I also understand that because both bodies have to be involved, it is highly unlikely that whatever we do would find its way to the President's desk this year.At the same time, circumstances might allow us to move that bill next week. But I would not put that on the list of things that we are almost certain to do, but certainly it is on the list of things we are looking at to see if there is a way we can go ahead and advance a House position so that our friends on the other side of the Capitol can move on this issue as well, and early next year, we could come to conclusion on an issue that is so critically important to so many Americans and their families.,2015-03-17 19:10:10.878929,2015-03-17 19:10:10.878929,House,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2005-12-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-12-08/html/CREC-2005-12-08-pt1-PgH11266-5.htm,157,18,151,H11266-H11268,B000575,mr. blunt
2488,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Honorable Bishop Vinton Randolph Anderson. Bishop Anderson's devotion to the ministry is exhibited by his history of preaching and lecturing internationally, including the Caribbean, Canada, Taiwan, India and Australia. In addition to his commitment to ministering, Bishop Anderson has been an effective and vocal advocate of civil rights and ecumenical issues.Bishop Anderson was born in 1947 in Somerset, Bermuda. He graduated with honors from Wilberforce University and earned his Master of Divinity Degree from Payne Theological Seminary. Later he earned his Master of Arts Degree in philosophy from Kansas University. Bishop Anderson has also received honorary doctorate degrees from Paul Quinn College, Wilberforce University, Payne Theological Seminary, Temple Bible College, Morris Brown College, Interdenominational Theological Center and Eden Theological Seminary. Bishop Anderson's pastoral experience encompasses Kansas and Missouri.Bishop Anderson has demonstrated his unwavering dedication to community development by creating adult education programs, summer youth programs, promoting the first black owned supermarket in St. Louis, and developing 162 units of low income housing in St. Louis County. Bishop Anderson's extraordinary leadership is exemplified through his participation as chairman of several boards of directors, membership with many committees and by the numerous honors that have been bestowed upon him.Mr. Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Bishop Anderson today before Congress. He is well-deserved of our respect, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Bishop Vinton Randolph Anderson.,2015-03-17 19:10:11.009044,2015-03-17 19:10:11.009044,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO BISHOP VINTON RANDOLPH ANDERSON,2004-03-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-03/html/CREC-2004-03-03-pt1-PgE285-3.htm,26,0,150,E285-E286,C001049,mr. clay

2492,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, let me take this means to recognize Lincoln University in Jefferson City, MO, on 137 years of service to the State of Missouri. On January 30, the annual Founders' Day Celebration was held at Richardson Auditorium at the university.Lincoln University was founded on January 14, 1866, by soldiers and officers of the 62nd and the 65th Missouri Colored Infantry units. They gave a combined $6,400 to establish the educational institution they named Lincoln Institute. The institute was founded with three stipulations: The institution shall be designed for the special benefit of the freed African Americans; it shall be located in the State of Missouri; and its fundamental idea shall be to combine study and labor.In 1921, the Missouri Legislature passed a bill introduced by Walthall M. Moore, the first Black American to serve in that body, which changed the name from Lincoln Institute to Lincoln University and created a board of curators to govern the University.Mr. Speaker, Lincoln University's annual Founders' Day Celebration is not only a celebration of another passing year's educational service but a chance once a year to remember the history of this great university. I applaud Lincoln University for its willingness to not forget the past and make sure its students know exactly how their university came to be. I know the Members of the House will join me in congratulating Lincoln University on 137 years of education excellence.,2015-03-17 19:10:11.553408,2015-03-17 19:10:11.553408,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN UNIVERSITY,2003-03-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-03-03/html/CREC-2003-03-03-pt1-PgE343-2.htm,33,0,149,E343,S000465,mr. skelton

Mr. Speaker, the United States Constitution requires the Congress to raise and maintain the military and also to establish the rules and regulations thereof. Through my years in Congress, I have had the opportunity to do both and particularly, in writing rules and regulations insofar as military education is concerned and insofar as the structure of the military is concerned, which resulted in what we now call Goldwater-Nickles.Mr. Speaker, this is the right thing to do. The Americans are in Saudi Arabia, have been in Saudi Arabia, were there to make sure that Saddam Hussein's troops did not come down south and into that country. They are there for the protection of that country.

2496,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gracious gentlewoman from Hawaii for this opportunity to join with her today as we are commemorating the 30th anniversary of the passage of title IX of the education amendments of 1972.This title has been instrumental in prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs and sports activities that receive Federal funding. This law applies to admissions, recruitment, financial aid, academic programs, grading, vocational education, recreation, physical education, employment, athletics, and much more. This title continues to present many opportunities for girls to acquire new skills, friendships and make their dreams a reality.Before title IX, many schools saw no problem in maintaining strict limits on the admission of women or simply refusing to admit them at all. Since the passage of title IX, this has changed dramatically. In 1994, women received 38 percent of medical degrees, 43 percent of law degrees, and 44 percent of all doctoral degrees. In 1972, women received only 9 percent of medical degrees, only 7 percent of law degrees, and a mere 25 percent of doctoral degrees.Title IX has provided unprecedented opportunities for young women interested in pursuing a competitive athletic career. The U.S. Women's Soccer team won the World Cup victory in 1991 against Norway and again in 1999 against China, and this was possible because title IX funds were available to the young women earlier in their lives.I had the opportunity to share a remarkable experience with the team. I was able to attend Eileen Collins' launch of a NASA space shuttle with the soccer team, then First Lady Hillary Clinton, and many other supporters of title IX. This was the first time a woman commanded a NASA shuttle. It was a spectacular event that symbolized the accomplishments of the act. Commander Collins and members of the soccer team continue to inspire younger women to follow their own dreams.Younger women are now aggressively entering many fields with more confidence and assurance because of the positive impact of models such as these and the availability of title IX funds. In my district, title IX has allowed many young women to enter and excel in sports. Independence's Fort Osage High School's Dana Rohr was awarded a $2,000 scholarship for her academic work and participation in sports. Angela Goodson of Blue Springs South High School won the Missouri State Girls title in swimming. Liz Pierson of Lee's Summit North won six goals and three assists for her soccer team, which finished second in Missouri. Janiece Gatson, a junior in Grandview, won fifth place at the Missouri 4A State meet for running 400 meters in 57.3 seconds. Saint Theresa's, an all girls' school in my district, became the first non-St. Louis team to win a Missouri 1A-3A soccer girls title with a 6-2 victory this past Saturday.Thanks to title IX, more and more young women are being recognized and encouraged for their scholarly and athletic work. Since 1971, women's participation in sports has markedly increased, with more than 135,000 women presently competing in intercollegiate sports. Women currently constitute nearly 40 percent of all college athletes, compared with only 15 percent in 1972.Recent data show that approximately 2.6 million high school girls participate in a wide selection of high school sports, representing nearly 40 percent of all high school athletes. In 1971, only 7.5 percent of high school athletes were female.Female participation in sports, like receiving a college education, has had an unexpected benefit for women. Studies have shown that values learned from sports participation, such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, and pride in accomplishment, are important attributes as women increase their participation in this workforce as well as their entry into business management and ownership positions.My love of sports throughout my schooling gave me confidence and a sense of accomplishment. The friendships I made with teammates and the memories we share keep us in contact in our adult lives. My experience in sports enabled me to attain leadership and professional skills and gave me the confidence that helped shape my career.Thirty years after the passage of title IX, we recognize and celebrate the profound changes this legislation has helped to bring about in America and the resulting improvements in educational and related job opportunities for millions of Americans. More and more women are entering and graduating from college and graduate school, more women are entering and excelling in sports activities, and more women are entering the corporate world and holding management positions.I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) for her leadership in enacting title IX. Thanks to her courage and her persistence, the country is better because more women are able to achieve their full potential. I am pleased to join with her and my colleagues today in celebrating the 30th anniversary of title IX and promise to work with them to uphold and enforce this legislation in order to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans.,2015-03-17 19:10:12.197866,2015-03-17 19:10:12.197866,House,CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX,2002-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-06-19/html/CREC-2002-06-19-pt1-PgH3703-6.htm,82,13,148,H3703-H3709,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

Furthermore, the program was named in Peterson's Smart Parents Guide to College as an example of how small colleges can become centers of culture for an entire region.Mr. President, Dr. Harriman has been a tremendous asset to William Jewell College and, indeed, the entire Kansas City area. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating him on this most distinguished honor. ,2015-03-17 19:10:13.176556,2015-03-17 19:10:13.176556,Senate,RECOGNITION OF THE HARRIMAN ARTS PROGRAM OF WILLIAM JEWELL COLLEGE,2000-02-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-02-10/html/CREC-2000-02-10-pt1-PgS642.htm,12,0,146,S642,B000611,mr. bond
2502,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, Susan B. Anthony is remembered for her pioneering work to establish equal rights for women. As she fought to widen society's guarantee of equal rights to include women, she also sought to widen this guarantee for others as well. For Susan B. Anthony, this meant opposing slavery. And it also meant rejecting abortion, which she considered nothing less than ``child murder.'' Today, 180 years after Susan B. Anthony's birth which we commemorate today, we continue her legacy in promoting equality under the law for all, including the unborn.Susan B. Anthony rejected abortion because she championed equal rights for all. In Anthony's view, abortion violated the rights of both women and children for it deprived the unborn of their right to life, and exploited women. As Susan B. Anthony said: ``When a woman destroys the life of her unborn child, it is a sign that, by education or circumstance, she has been greatly wronged.''On this the 180th anniversary of her birthday, let us recommit ourselves to fulfilling the pro-life and pro-women vision of Susan B. Anthony, moving toward that day when neither women nor children shall ever again be greatly wronged by abortion.,2015-03-17 19:10:13.453759,2015-03-17 19:10:13.453759,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO SUSAN B.

2503,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to speak in tribute to all the men and women in law enforcement in this country. This week, May 14-20, is National Police Week, set aside to honor the men and women behind the badge. In 1962, Congress passed and President Kennedy signed a joint resolution proclaiming May 15 of each year as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week of each year during which such May 15 occurs as Police Week, ``in recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our laws,'' from Public Law 87-726.Sadly, between 140 and 160 law enforcement officers die in the line of duty each year. On average, 21,433 officers are injured in the line of duty each year.In honor of the thousands of officers who have given their lives to protect the people of this Nation, I am pleased to announce an important step that the Senate took yesterday in furtherance of a much needed change in the current federal law. Last September I introduced S. 1638, a bill to expand the educational opportunities under the Deegan program, named after slain Federal officer Bill Deegan, for the families of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. This bill honors those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending our communities by making available Federal funds to those officers' spouses and dependent children in order to pursue secondary education.Yesterday, on National Peace Officers Memorial Day, the Senate unanimously passed S. 1638. I want to thank the Senate for taking this action, and urge the House to do the same.I want to thank the co-sponsors of this bill--Senators Collins, Grams, Robb, Tim Hutchinson, Dodd, Abraham, Specter, Bryan, Gregg, Helms, and Biden. I am very pleased by the bipartisan support for the bill, and for the endorsements of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and other law enforcement organizations.This bill extends retroactively the benefits created under the 1992 law to the surviving spouses and dependent children of law enforcement officials who were killed between 1978 and the current start dates of the program.It is important to extend these benefits back to the year 1978 because under the existing program, a large number of dependent children currently between the ages 8 and 21, those born between 1978 and 1992, are excluded from participating in the program merely because their parent was killed before 1992. Pushing back the date allows these dependent children, currently facing the prospect of paying for secondary education in the often financially strained environment of a single-parent family, also to benefit from this program.This goal is consistent with the intent of the original law: an effort to show our gratitude to the maximum number of dependent children of slain law enforcement officers.This provision affects the families of an estimated 4,100 officers, including more than 60 in Missouri. The bill makes these spouses and dependent children eligible for up to $5820 a year for 4 years if they enroll in full-time study at an approved secondary school. In short, it helps the loved ones of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defending the rest of us by allowing them to pursue their dreams to move forward with their lives and continue their education.On this occasion, I also want to thank a very important organization headquartered in Camdenton, MO--the Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. [COPS]. COPS was organized in 1984 with 110 members. Today COPS' membership is over 10,000 families. Concerns of Police Survivors, provides resources to assist in the rebuilding of the lives of surviving families of slain law enforcement officers.Furthermore, COPS provides training to law enforcement agencies on survivor victimization issues and educates the public of the need to support the law enforcement profession and its survivors.To help those families begin rebuilding their shattered lives, COPS is again hosting the National Police Survivors' Seminars as part of National Police Week--the second day of this seminar is occurring today in Alexandria, VA. For 15 years, COPS' National Police Survivors' Seminars have provided survivors of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty the opportunity to interact with other survivors and have access to some of the best mental health professionals available. I wish to thank COPS for the many programs that they operate in addition to the Police Survivors' Seminars, including scholarships, peer-support at the national, State, and local levels, ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' counseling programs, the ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' Summer Camp, Parents' Retreats, trial and parole support, and other assistance programs.We owe a debt of gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of police officers who protect the lives and property of their fellow Americans. By the enforcement of our laws, these same officers have given our country internal freedom from fear and are responsible for helping our nation lower its crime rates again this year. These men and women, by their patriotic service and their dedicated efforts, have earned the gratitude of us all.Officers who give their lives to protect our freedom leave behind families that must cope with the terrible loss. When this tragedy occurs, we have an obligation to help the spouses and children of fallen heroes. One way to help is to offer the opportunity to pursue their education. I thank the Senate for supporting this bill, and urge the House of Representatives to pass this legislation quickly.,2015-03-17 19:10:13.598862,2015-03-17 19:10:13.598862,Senate,LAW ENFORCEMENT SURVIVORS' EDUCATION BENEFITS,2000-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-16/html/CREC-2000-05-16-pt1-PgS4005-3.htm,60,0,146,S4005-S4006,A000356,mr. ashcroft

Words alone do not fully describe the sorrow Jane and I and all Missourians feel at the loss of our Governor.Mel Carnahan was a good man. He was a decent, caring man. He loved his state, and he fought hard for every person in it. A man who considered public service a high calling, Mel had a quiet, humble demeanor and his commitment to families in Missouri made a difference in the lives of millions of people.A beloved governor, the son of two teachers in the Ozark mountains, Mel worked hard day after day to give every child a chance in life. He was committed to education with a sincere passion.We extend our deepest sympathy to Mel's wife Jean and their three surviving children; our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult moment.

2505,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, last night in the State of the Union message the President set some good goals for America. He talked about a balanced budget, he talked about saving Social Security. He committed himself further to welfare reform; he is for education reform, he is against drugs, he is even for some family tax cuts.The question is not about whether these are the goals we want for America, but how to achieve those goals.For instance, the President said that a family of four that makes less than $35,000 should not pay any Federal income tax if they have high child care costs. Well, I agree. A family of four that makes less than $35,000 should not pay any Federal income tax. But it should not matter whether they have child care costs or not--$35,000 for a family of four is $35,000.Mr. Speaker, we ought to work for those American families, and we ought to work for better solutions for American families.,2015-03-17 19:10:14.301356,2015-03-17 19:10:14.301356,House,ACHIEVING AMERICA'S GOALS,1998-01-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-01-28/html/CREC-1998-01-28-pt1-PgH69-4.htm,2,1,144,H69,B000575,mr. blunt
2506,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, in spite of the fact that the United States has the most advanced health care system in the world, 3 percent of our children are born with birth defects. Approximately 150,000 babies are born each year in this country with a serious birth defect.Although some birth defects are minor and have no permanent consequences, others cause permanent disability, which necessitates constant medical care, special education and other services that cost victims and their families countless tears and thousands of dollars each year. All too often serious birth defects result in death. In fact, birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in America today.Next week, the House will consider legislation that could dramatically reduce the incidence of birth defects in America. The Birth Defects Prevention Act, sponsored by Senator Kit Bond and passed by the Senate last year, would direct the Centers for Disease Control to serve as the national clearinghouse for the collection and storage of data on birth defects, help states establish birth defect surveillance programs or improve existing ones, and make grants available to the public and nonprofit organizations to develop and implement birth defect prevention strategies.,2015-03-17 19:10:14.556536,2015-03-17 19:10:14.556536,House,THE BIRTH DEFECTS PREVENTION ACT,1998-03-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-05/html/CREC-1998-03-05-pt1-PgH856.htm,21,1,144,H856,B000575,mr. blunt

Why was it that last year the tax cuts that were passed while the budget was in a deficit were not a threat to Social Security, but tax cuts while the budget is in surplus are?This is just goofy, Mr. Speaker.The other side is counting yet again on their hopes that seniors will not know the facts, so they can scare them just like they did 2 years ago about cuts in Medicare. Those cuts turned out to be actually increases in Medicare.Even goofier is their obvious bad faith in opposing tax cuts this year, along with their argument that billions and billions of dollars of new spending they support does not raid Social Security.Well, my friends on the other side of the aisle, which is it?

2513,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that there is a term in the vocabulary adequate to describe my level of disgust with this bill. The Republican majority began this process with proposals reported out of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and the Workforce that represented the most pernicious assault on the working poor I have witnessed as a 29-year Member of this body.In response to the chorus of outrage that rang out against those proposals, the majority fabricated window dressing to make their proposals seem more moderate. But this new manager's amendment, rewritten by the Committee on Rules late last night, remains unfair, immoral and unconscionable.Mr. Speaker, I have three fundamental objections to this bill. First, it establishes a new class of workers who would be treated like indentured servants without coverage under the landmark worker protection and civil rights laws. Second, it concocts a scheme of watered-down grievance procedures and remedies that would render millions of workers unprotected from discrimination and exploitation. And finally, Mr. Speaker, it endangers the job security and financial well-being of millions of current public sector employees by establishing a weak set of nondisplacement protections.Here is why this proposal treats poor workers like second-class Americans. It denies so-called community service participants employee status and purports to use the old CWEP Program as precedent. But that program was quite different from the workfare program established in this proposal. Whereas that program had a strong training element, the community service program established by this proposal is work, pure and simple.Community service workers will be employees in every sense of the term. They will sweat like other workers, their children will get sick just like the children of other workers. And these workers have dreams and aspirations for their families just like other workers.But this proposal says no, they are not the same and they do not deserve full respect and dignity. Although they will be employed to perform the same tasks performed by other workers, these welfare workers will be denied the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the many other important Federal laws. And those employed by nonprofit private sector employers will be denied the right to organize or bargain collectively.The grievance procedures established in the rewritten proposal are a house of courts, substantially weaker than protections adopted by the Republicans on the Committee on Education and the Workforce. There is no provision to ensure that the grievances will be fairly heard and adjudicated. In a real blow against due process, there is no appeal from what may well turn out to be a kangaroo court.Here is an example of how outrageous these grievance procedures are. A woman who has been sexually harassed may be required to seek redress from the very agency where the harassment occurred. Under this proposal that woman would not be entitled to a fair hearing, or the right to appeal an adverse decision. What have poor women done to deserve such indignity?Finally, protections that were included in the education and work force proposal to ensure that community service workers are not used as pawns in a ploy to displace existing workers have been gutted by the manager's amendment. As reported by the Committee on Education and the Workforce, a welfare worker could not be assigned to an equivalent job if another individual was on layoff status. That protection has now been effectively stripped. As reported by committee, a welfare worker could not be assigned to a job if a consequence of that assignment was the partial displacement of an existing worker. Those protections have also been deleted.Mr. Speaker, this legislation is nothing short of a bill of exploitation that will leave workers more vulnerable to racism, sexism, and unsafe workplaces. Rather than encouraging work, these provisions demean workers. I urge its resounding defeat.,2015-03-17 19:10:16.486909,2015-03-17 19:10:16.486909,House,BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997,1997-06-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-25/html/CREC-1997-06-25-pt1-PgH4416.htm,91,63,143,H4416-H4606,C000488,mr. clay

The Republicans are going to spend $1.4 million of tax money to intimidate labor leaders, harass the Department of Labor, and attempt to repeal labor laws that have protected the rights of workers for over a half a century.This plot was never discussed in a public hearing of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and it was approved by the House oversight committee without any witnesses testifying to its need. Although the majority is trying to dress up their mission statement, the real attempt is to pursue an extremist antiunion agenda. The Republicans are scheming to attack union members as payback for labor union participation in the 1996 elections.

No strangers to hard work and sacrifice, the Boyers are struggling to provide their children with a quality education.Cecil is a janitor in the County Sheriff's Department; Mary, a biology and algebra teacher for the past 23 years at Valle Catholic High School, has started working a second job as an attendant at a local gas station.Now not only are the Boyers taking out student loans, but their daughter, Cathy, a junior at Central Missouri State and their son, Kevin, a Jefferson Community College student are also working part-time jobs. Combined, the Boyer family, four people working five jobs, make about $50,000 a year, middle class by anybody's definition of the word.Under the Democratic tax plan, the Boyers would receive a $1,584 tax cut; under the Republican vision of tax relief the Boyers would receive only $528 in tax cuts.Republicans have taken weeks to reach agreement on a unified tax cut proposal, but for most middle-income families like the Boyers it was not worth waiting for.We hope the President can persuade Republicans to move toward the Democratic tax cut and direct relief into the pockets of the families who truly need it.,2015-03-17 19:10:17.064325,2015-03-17 19:10:17.064325,House,TAX RELIEF FOR FAMILIES WHO TRULY NEED IT,1997-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-07-24/html/CREC-1997-07-24-pt1-PgH5668-2.htm,106,1,143,H5668,G000132,mr. gephardt

The Constitution is different than any other document that was ever devised as a framework for Government on this continent or any other, and the difference in the Constitution is found in the first three words, ``We the people.''No other document ever purported to be the framework for Government and get its right to govern from the people. The Magna Carta started, ``We the Barons of England.'' The Articles of Confederation started, ``We the States.''This document has been the framework that has lasted longer than any other document that has been the framework for Government. It has been copied by country after country.One of the major tenets of the Constitution is the importance of State governments, the importance of communities, the importance of a Federal Government that acts appropriately in this Federal system we have.We will be bringing bills to the House later this year, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Rogan] has pointed out, that I am a cosponsor of, that we have cosponsors of from both sides of the aisle, that talk about giving more decisionmaking back to states, back to communities, and education.

2517,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute a great man from Kansas City, Albert P. Mauro, as the first recipient of the American Citizen Award presented by the Southtown Council which for 15 years has brought together area businesses, associations, institutions, and neighborhoods to educate and strengthen our community. Mr. Mauro has served our community for over 40 years. In 1954 he was an assistant to City Manager L.P. Cookingham. He went on to lead the fight to end segregation at General Hospital. He was the public policy architect behind the vision for combining all the entities on hospital hill and more importantly the collaborative funding sources--that is, city, State, county, Federal, and so forth. No other complex has had such a diverse and complex fund mechanism. Through his work, the economic development of our area thrived. His leadership contributed tirelessly to the campaigns for the Boys and Girls Club, the Genesis School, and in securing the construction of the Deramus Education Pavilion at the Kansas City Zoo. Although he has retired as vice president and corporate secretary of Kansas City Southern Industries, he continues to chair the downtown council and serves on numerous boards and civic associations.Mr. Mauro's combination of compassion and ingenuity have produced a brighter future for Kansas City. I join with the Southtown Council in recognizing Mr. Mauro for his leadership, integrity, and friendship.Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Mauro on his well-deserved receipt of the First Southtown Council American Citizen Award.,2015-03-17 19:10:17.542689,2015-03-17 19:10:17.542689,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO ALBERT P.

I would say to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Etheridge], if North Carolina or any State does not want to use these opportunity scholarships, there is a simple answer. They do not have to under this bill. It is up to them.I want to read a quote from Jonathan Rauch, who was writing in the November 10th New Republic. I think it is applicable to the debate today.``It's hard to get excited about improving rich suburban high schools that act as feeders for Ivy League colleges. However, for poor children trapped in execrable schools, the case is moral rather than merely educational. These kids attend schools which cannot protect their physical safety, much less teach them. To require poor people to go to dangerous, dysfunctional schools that better-off people fled years ago, and that better-off people would never tolerate for their own children--all the while intoning pieties about `saving' public education--is worse than unsound public policy. It is repugnant public policy.'',2015-03-17 19:10:17.875896,2015-03-17 19:10:17.875896,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,190,143,H9941-H9965,T000024,mr. talent
2519,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, as we have progressed in this House through the appropriation for the education program, especially for our title I program, we have found a continuation of the philosophy on the majority side that these funds for elementary and secondary education can be cut without causing any harm to the students in the school systems throughout the United States, that the majority of the Republicans feel, under the leadership of Newt Gingrich that these funds can be cut and no harm will be done.I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you and other Members of this House do as I have done, and that is to contact your local school districts and talk to them about what a 17- or 20-percent cut in title I funds for remedial reading and reading recovery or math, remedial math, and those programs will do to those local districts.I have done so and I would like to read to you, without naming the names of the school districts, some of the comments that have come from those schools. One says a 17-percent cut in funding will be a cut of $15,000 to $16,000 real program dollars. They currently have two full-time teachers, elementary level, who teach remedial reading and math. Since the calculation for change this year, they actually get more money and will have a little carryover. They plan to use the carryover to fund a reading recovery program. They do not have a summer school program.Another one currently has 35 or 36 full-time teachers, about 18 aides, who serve 400 to 500 students. They deal with remedial reading and math during the regular school year and summer school, which includes pre-kindergarten level, to start a reading recovery program for at-risk first graders which is working out wonderfully. A 20-percent cut, which is what is heard, will be a great impact on their schools. Off the top of his head, the superintendent said that they would do all they could to save the reading recovery, but cuts will be done to regular remedial programs.Another one, currently one of every two teachers with two aides full-time; they deal with two remedial reading classes. Total program costs $75,000 to $80,000 to fund, no math program, no reading recovery program. They have had astounding success with remedial reading, do not want to lose this program, program serves grades 1 through 6. Majority emphasis is on 1, 2, and 3, although it continues to grade 6, and they have students in 4, 5, and 6 who still participate in the program. The majority of students graduate after grade 3. Cuts in the program would hurt this system.Another one currently has 3\1/2\ teachers in grades 1 through 6 teaching remedial reading and math, are anticipating loss of 1 full-time teacher. Each teacher there serves 45 to 60 students. If you lose one teacher, 60 students will not be served in remedial reading. Feels that remedial reading is a good program, has had good results.Here is one from another school district. They get a little over $200,000 in title I funding, have about 7 full-time teachers plus two aides. Figures they would be cut about $40,000. This means a loss of one teacher, probably one aide and one program. Currently have remedial reading and math in extended-day kindergarten and a transition program for first graders. Those who seem to be struggling are placed in classroom with two teachers. Figures the program that would be cut would be the extended-day kindergarten. They currently serve about 200 kids. Said they are not a high-impact district.And there are other local school districts closer by that are high-impact and would have more adverse effects on those.Here is another one. They are every dollar they receive from the title I to directly benefit a child. Currently have three full-time teachers who teach remedial reading and math. Besides regular program during the day, they have had an evening program which provides tutoring. The three teachers serve about 500 students, 25 percent of school population. Cuts in the program funds would directly cut one or more of the teachers. Could not absorb the cuts, and they thank our staff for calling. They say they are quite concerned with it.I have many others here that have answered our questionnaire, and all of them are to the gist that with a couple of exceptions where the school districts are fairly well funded, that they would not be able to replace these programs with local funds, that they would have to do without, and many children would be hurt by these cuts that are being made in education for the title I programs.Every one of them said that these moneys, our Federal dollars, are being used wisely to help educate, they are being used to make sure our children learn as they progress through the elementary grades. And I think it is poundwise, very foolish for their House to continue on the road to cutting education for our youngsters. They are the future of our country. To say we do not need to educate them, I think is a vast mistake.Another thing I would like to comment on is some of these school districts are in very economically low-grade or poor areas, and they need this money. They are not going to be able to replace it with local tax dollars.So I urge the House to restore the funding for our educational programs.,2015-03-17 19:10:18.210134,2015-03-17 19:10:18.210134,House,CUTS IN APPROPRIATIONS FOR EDUCATION,1996-03-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-13/html/CREC-1996-03-13-pt1-PgH2194-2.htm,34,1,142,H2194-H2195,V000112,mr. volkmer
2520,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the radical Republican majority is still bent on cutting educational funds, especially title I funds. It is mean-spirited. Who does it impact on? Not the local school districts, but it impacts on children; children, preschool children in the first and second grade; children like the two that I visited with and many others in my district while I was out there. These young children, without these reading skills, will be destined to a future that they will not be able to participate in in this great society of ours because they will not be able to read.The Republicans say that we do not need those funds for title I. I say we do. I say that the future of this country is bound by the education that our children receive, and it is necessary that they have the skills of reading and math, and that is what title I provides.I say to the Republicans, let us not be mean-spirited.,2015-03-17 19:10:18.442306,2015-03-17 19:10:18.442306,House,LET US NOT BE MEAN-SPIRITED,1996-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-23/html/CREC-1996-04-23-pt1-PgH3666-2.htm,53,1,142,H3666,V000112,mr. volkmer
2521,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, It has come to my attention that a distinguished career in the banking industry has come to an end.Joe W. Scallorns, bank president of Farmers and Traders Bank, retired recently after over 30 years of serving Missouri's banking needs.Scallorn's distinguished banking career began as a bank collector in Columbia, Missouri while finishing his degree as a student at the University of Missouri. After college, he joined Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as a credit analyst. He returned to Columbia in 1967, eventually rising to the position of Vice President of the First Bank of Commerce and later as President of the First National Bank and Trust Company. He joined Eagle Bank of Highland, Illinois, as its President in 1987. In June 1988, he purchased Farmers and Traders Bank in California, Missouri.Additionally, Joe is active in professional organizations, chairing the committees on Banking Education, Legislative Affairs, and the Political Action Committee of the Missouri Banking Association, also serving on its Board of Directors. He also served on the Government Relations Council of the American Bankers Association and its National BancPac Committee.As he prepares for quieter time with his wife, Fran and his son, Joseph, I know all Members of Congress will join me in paying tribute to my good friend Joe Scallorns and in wishing him the best in the days ahead.,2015-03-17 19:10:18.676472,2015-03-17 19:10:18.676472,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RETIRING MISSOURI FARMERS AND TRADERS BANK PRESIDENT JOE W.

2522,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Yes, that is correct. I am proposing this provision in response to specific concerns I have heard from Missourians.Mr. President, a message that I am hearing from parents and teachers and students is the issue of school discipline. For the past few months my staff and I have been looking into this issue to see if there are changes that can and should be made to the Individuals with Disabilities Act Reauthorization legislation, in order to give local schools the flexibility they need to apply disciplinary measures in a fair, uniform, and logical manner. I will have more to say on this issue when the Senate takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.But one issue has come to my attention that I believe Congress should address right now, and it involves the issue of a school's ability to discipline IDEA students who carry or possess weapons to or at schools.Mr. President, I have proposed a provision within Amendment No. 68 which makes an important addition to a provision in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The revision I propose will ensure that the IDEA legislation accurately reflects the intent of Congress that schools should have the ability to place a child with a disability in an alternative setting for discipline situations involving weapons.Specifically, this provision revises the law to explicitly allow a school to place a child with a disability in an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the child carries a weapon to or possesses a weapon at school, on school premises, or to or at a school function. Currently, the law says that a school could take such action only if the child carries a weapon to school or to a school function.The problem with the current statutory language is that it creates an unintended loophole which could prevent a school from placing a child in an alternative placement if the child at question is in possession of a weapon.Some school boards in my state have expressed concerns about the language in the IDEA reauthorization allowing a 45 day change in placement of a child who ``carries'' a weapon to school. Schools want to know whether that language means they can change the placement of a child whom they found to be in ``possession'' of a weapon, as well as a child found to be simply ``carrying'' the weapon to school. They are afraid that the language of the statute sets up a distinction that is going to create a big loophole which kids can jump through to avoid the 45 day change in placement.Right now, there is a situation in a school district in my state involving two students, both with individualized education programs (IEPs). I have been asked not to name the specific school district at issue because proceedings are still pending on this matter. But here are the facts: Student A carried a weapon into the school and gave it to Student B, who then put the weapon into his (Student B's) locker. The school knew that it could put Student A into an alternative placement, since Student A literally ``carried `` the weapon into school. But could the school also change Student B's placement, since technically he didn't ``carry'' the weapon into school, but instead was simply ``possessing'' it?The school went ahead and also placed Student B in an alternative placement as well. However, the school is now worried that at the pending proceeding, Student B will raise the issue of ``carrying'' as opposed to ``possessing'' the weapon. The school says that it doesn't know how it will be able to get around an argument from the child or his parent that the child did not literally carry the weapon to school.Surely Congress did not intend to set up such a situation in the 1997 IDEA reauthorization. Surely we intended that schools have the ability to place a child in an alternative setting for up to 45 days if the child possessed a weapon on school premises, as well as carried a weapon to the school. And this is why we should pass this amendment: to ensure that schools have the ability to take the appropriate measures against students when weapons are involved.I would like to point out that even the Department of Education has acknowledged that the current statutory language ``carries a weapon to school or to a school function'' is ambiguous, and that it was the clear intent of Congress to cover instances in which the child is found to be in possession of a weapon at school.Now this amendment, if passed, would not apply to the school district in Missouri that is facing this dilemma, since that is a pending case. But we would be addressing this problem for any future situations, providing the clarity that schools, parents, and children need.Mr. President, schools, teachers, principals, and administrators want and need to be able to treat all students on a uniform basis when weapons are involved. We need to be sure that our laws allow a school to remove any student from the regular classroom if that student is found with a weapon at school. We need to close up any loopholes in the law that would prevent a school from taking this immediate action to maintain a safe learning environment for our students.Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join with me in making this vital addition to the IDEA law, so that schools will be able to exercise the authority we intended to give them to maintain a safe school environment for all our children.,2015-03-17 19:10:18.986692,2015-03-17 19:10:18.986692,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-11/html/CREC-1999-03-11-pt1-PgS2556-2.htm,39,139,145,S2556-S2573,A000356,mr. ashcroft

This is an intense engineering competition of highly trained and dedicated federal employees, both military and civilian. The candidates are accomplished in their education, service, and leadership to accomplish their agencies' missions. They have performed above and beyond their job descriptions and represent the best and the brightest among those who work for all the citizens of the United States.Lieutenant Colonel Estes commands the 169th Engineer Battalion at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where he oversees the training, discipline, and management of over 2,000 new soldiers a year in nine different military engineering occupational specialities. He contributes immeasurably to his community by teaching night courses to soldiers and donating that salary to charities and battalion activities. Lieutenant Colonel Estes is a pioneer in the application of system reliability and optimization techniques for engineering structures. His leadership, accomplishments, community service, and participation in professional organizations make him ideally suited for the Federal Engineer of the Year Award.Other finalists for this award who deserve recognition are Gregory M.

2524,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Senator Domenici, first let me reiterate my admiration for the remarkable budget you have produced. You have produced a budget that, in the first decade of the new millennium, balances the entire federal budget, protects Social Security, increases funding for education by 40%, seeks to protect the Social Security surplus from paying for other government operations, reduces federal debt, provides funds requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to strengthen our national defense, and provides an $800 billion tax cut. This is a strong budget that I will support.As you know, I intended to offer an amendment that would eliminate a $2.9 billion deficit currently projected for FY 2000. It appears likely, however, that when the final budget resolution is written and we have the latest budget and economic forecasts, that this deficit will be eliminated and, in fact, the budget will be in surplus. As I understand, the budget resolution, as reported by the committee, provides that any FY 2000 surplus should be devoted to tax cuts.,2015-03-17 19:10:19.756233,2015-03-17 19:10:19.756233,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000,1999-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-25/html/CREC-1999-03-25-pt2-PgS3385-2.htm,48,320,145,S3385-S3432,A000356,mr. ashcroft

The number is vast, with 13 or 14 percent in Tennessee, and 13 or 14 percent of the students in Missouri and Iowa. These are not people who show up for school with guns very often. When some of them do, they are threatening the others.When a person shows up with explosives or a gun at school, the objective there ought to be school safety. It ought to be to address that.The amendment provides school officials with the discretion to suspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in the same manner as other students in cases where they bring firearms to school.It has been stated there is a lot of opposition.

When you suggest that there is an equity for those who are subject to an IEP, but the violation is not a manifestation of the disability, that there is not any requirement for services, that is simply not true. The law provides the services must continue.I think the fundamental point the Senator from Tennessee and I want to make is this. There are not very many people who are bringing guns to school. There are very few of them. And even fewer who would bring guns or pipe bombs to school are students with a disability.But for those who do, the school officials ought not to have to go through torturous legal proceedings and laborious determinations of manifestations and the like for those who bring pipe bombs and guns to school.

Children's hospitals are responsible for the pediatric training of almost one-third of the Nation's pediatricians. A lack of Federal support jeopardizes all education and training programs in children's hospitals, thereby threatening not only the pediatric workforce, but future health-care research and our children's health.

2530,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I wanted to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues the very clear, overwhelming message I received as I traveled over the State of Missouri and met with teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, and school board members. They asked me a very simple question: Why is it the people in Washington know so much more about our needs than we do? How are you, in Washington, DC, so smart, to know that what we really need is more teachers?I can tell you instance after instance where, for example, they say: Look, we are in a small school. We only have so many classrooms. We cannot put another teacher in those classrooms. What we need is more equipment. Do not give us the money for a teacher for whom we do not have a classroom, or do not give us more money for another teacher when our salaries are so low we have to raise all the teachers' salaries in order to make sure we keep good people in teaching. It is not just quantity. In a lot of these areas it is getting the money to pay for quality teachers. That is why I believe the Gorton proposal is the way to go.I have talked to those in small school districts who say: Do you know what we would get? We would get .17 of a teacher, 17 percent of a teacher. That makes a pretty poor teacher, when you have only 17 percent of the teacher. They have not quite figured out how to usefully employ seventeen one-hundredths of a teacher.But that is the extreme case. The real case, time and time again, is that this is viewed in school districts around my State, and I suggest it would be viewed that way in your own States if you asked them, that Washington is not so smart as to know what each district--whether it is North Callaway or the Scotts Corner or the Martinsburg-Wellsville-Middletown School District needs another half a teacher, or a teacher-and-a-half. Those decisions should be made by the school boards that represent and serve the parents of the district who employ the superintendents and the principals and the teachers.I proposed something called a direct check for education, which is molded on the work of my colleague, Senator Gorton. That has had overwhelming support from people who actually do the job of teaching our students. We entrust the future of our students to these people. Then we come in from Washington, DC, and say: We are a lot smarter; we know what you need in the school district. One size does not fit all. Washington's solution is not right in every school district. I can assure you of that. I can assure you the people who are responsible, the people who are elected--usually by the constituents in that district, the patrons of the school district--want to see the best for their children.Do you know what bugs them? Do you know what is causing them problems? It is all the time and energy they waste in filling out the forms on how they used that 17 percent of a teacher. Filling out those reports, sending them to Washington to keep more bureaucrats busy, does not educate a child or teach the child to read. It doesn't help that child figure out multiplication or division or even to learn about science and history. We need to get the Federal redtape and regulations and misdirected priorities off the backs of the schools that are laboring to teach our kids.If you have any confidence at all in public education, public education in America today is, and must be, controlled at the local level. Yes, it is a national priority. It must be a national priority.I commended President Bush when he set out to start the work of raising the standards and the expectations for everybody in America to improve our education system. That is a national priority. But it is a local responsibility. Let us not impose our will on local officials, school board officials, parents, principals, and the teachers on how to spend that money.I think this is a clear-cut case where we want to trust the people who teach our kids. They know the kids' names, they know the kids' problems, and they know the kids' opportunities.I urge support of the Gorton amendment. I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.Several Senators addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:10:20.865026,2015-03-17 19:10:20.865026,Senate,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000,1999-09-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-09-29/html/CREC-1999-09-29-pt1-PgS11585-8.htm,129,205,145,S11585-S11637,B000611,mr. bond
2531,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I am at a loss to understand why the gentleman would exclude Title I from factoring in the administrative costs when it is the largest education program in the country, $8 billion. And when we factor in the ESEA to Title I funding, my figures are correct. Ninety-nine percent of the Federal money goes to the States, and 94 percent of that goes to the classroom.The problem the gentleman from Pennsylvania has is with his State agency. IDEA, when we send Federal money to the State, the State keeps 25 percent of it instead of sending it on to the LEAs or the local LEAs or to the classroom. When the national average for that money is 13.5 percent, what is the State of Pennsylvania doing with the other 13.5 percent, the other 12.5 percent? That is where his problem is, and that is where he ought to be trying to get the State legislature to do something about that.Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Martinez).(Mr. MARTINEZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.),2015-03-17 19:10:21.047157,2015-03-17 19:10:21.047157,House,SENSE OF THE HOUSE URGING 95 PERCENT OF FEDERAL EDUCATION DOLLARS BE SPENT IN THE CLASSROOM,1999-10-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-12/html/CREC-1999-10-12-pt1-PgH9843-2.htm,137,7,145,H9843-H9847,C000488,mr. clay
2532,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I insert the following eloquent speech entitled ``the True Goal of Education'' into the Congressional Record.It is a pleasure to be here, and to join in marking the chamber's Business Appreciation Month. New Hampshire is a state of small businesses. Many of them here in the north country are prospering, and this organization has played an important part. I am honored by your invitation. I am an optimist, I believe that the next century will be a time of incredible prosperity--if we can create an environment where entrepreneurs like you can dream and flourish. A prosperity sustained by low taxes, unleashed by lighter regulation, energized by new technologies, expanded by free trade. A prosperity beyond all our expectations, but within our grasp. But this hope, in the long-run, depends directly on the education of our children--on young men and women with the skills and character to succeed. So for the past few months, I have focused on the problems and promise of our public schools. In September, I talked about disadvantaged children left behind by failed schools. The diminished hopes of our current system are sad and serious--the soft bigotry of low expectations. Schools that do not teach and will not change must have some final point of accountability. A moment of truth, when their federal funds, intended to help the poorest children, are divided up and given to parents--for tutoring or a charter school or some other hopeful option. Last month, I talked about raising the academic ambitions of every public school in America--creating a culture of achievement. My plan lifts the burden of bureaucracy, and gives states unprecedented freedom in spending federal education dollars. In return for this flexibility, each state must adopt a system of real accountability and high standards. Students must be tested on the basics of reading and math each year--and those results posted, by school, on the Internet. This will give parents the information to know if education is actually taking place--and the leverage to demand reform. My education proposals are bound by a thread of principle. The federal government must be humble enough to stay out of the day-to-day operation of local schools. It must be wise enough to give states and school districts more authority and freedom. And it must be strong enough to require proven performance in return. The federal role in education is to foster excellence and challenge failure with charters and choice. The federal role in education is not to serve the system. It is to serve the children. Yet this is only part of an agenda. Yes, we want our children to be smart and successful. But even more, we want them to be good and kind and decent. Yes, our children must learn how to make a living. But even more, they must learn how to live, and what to love. ``Intelligence is not enough,'' said Martin Luther King, Jr. ``Intelligence plus character--that is the true goal of education.'' So today, here in New Hampshire, I want to make the case for moral education. Teaching is more than training, and learning is more than literacy. Our children must be educated in reading and writing--but also in right and wrong. Of course, every generation worries about the next. ``Children today are tyrants,'' said one educator. ``They contradict their parents, gobble their food, and tyrannize their teachers.'' And that teacher's name was . . . Socrates. Some things don't change. The real problem comes, not when children challenge the rules, but when adults won't defend the rules. And for about three decades, many American schools surrendered this role. Values were ``clarified,'' not taught. Students were given moral puzzles, not moral guidance. But morality is not a cafeteria of personal choices--with every choice equally right and equally arbitrary, like picking a flavor of ice cream. We do not shape our own morality. It is morality that shapes our lives. Take an example. A Massachusetts teacher--a devoted supporter of values clarification--had a sixth grade class which announced that it valued cheating, and wanted the freedom to express that value during tests. Her response? ``I personally value honesty,'' she said. ``Although you may choose to be dishonest, I will insist that we be honest on our tests here. In other areas of your life, you may have to be dishonest.'' This is not moral neutrality. It is moral surrender. Our schools should not cultivate confusion. They must cultivate conscience. In spite of conflicting signals--and in spite of a popular culture that sometimes drowns their innocence--most of our kids are good kids. Large numbers do volunteer work. Nearly all believe in God, and most practice their faith. Teen pregnancy and violence are actually going down. Across America, under a program called True Love Waits, nearly a million teens have pledged themselves to abstain from sex until marriage. Our teenagers feel the pressures of complex times, but also the upward pull of a better nature. They deserve our love and they deserve our encouragement. And sometimes they show character and courage beyond measure. When a gun is aimed at a seventeen-year-old in Colorado--and she is shot for refusing to betray her Lord. When a seventeen-year-old student, during a madman's attack on a Fort Worth church, is shot while shielding a friend with Downs Syndrome--and continues to comfort her, even after her own injury. We are finding, in the midst of tragedy, that our children can be heroes too. Yet something is lost when the moral message of schools is mixed and muddled. Many children catch a virus of apathy and cynicism. They lose the ability to make confident judgments-- viewing all matters of right and wrong as a matter of opinion. Something becomes frozen within them--a capacity for indignation and empathy. You can see it in shrugged shoulders. You can hear it in the watchword of a generation: ``Whatever,'' Academics like Professor Robert Simon report seeing many students--nice, well-intentioned young men and women--who refuse to make judgments even about the Holocaust. ``Of course I dislike the Nazis,'' he quotes a student, ``but who is to say they are morally wrong?'' At the extreme, in the case of a very few children-- lawless, loveless and lonely--this confusion can harden into self-destruction or evil, suicide or violence. They find no elevating ideals--from parents or church or school--to counter the chaos in their souls. ``We laugh at honor,'' said C.S. Lewis, ``and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.'' But something is changing in this country. Perhaps we have been sobered by tragedy. Perhaps the Baby Boom generation has won some wisdom from its failures and pain. But we are no longer laughing at honor. ``Values clarirfication'' seems like a passing superstition. Many states have instituted real character education in their schools, and many more are headed in that direction. After decades of drift, we are beginning a journey of renewal. Above all, we are relearning a sense of idealism for our children. Parents and teachers are rediscovering a great calling and a heavy burden: to write on the slate of souls. We must tell our children--with conviction and confidence-- that the authors of the Holocaust were evil men, and the authors of the Constitution were good ones. That the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not a personal opinion, but an eternal truth. And we must tell our children--with clarity and certainty-- that character gives direction to their gifts and dignity to their lives. That life is too grand and important to be wasted on whims and wants, on getting and keeping. That selfishness is a dark dungeon. That bigotry disfigures the heart. That they were made for better things and higher goals. The shape of our society, the fate of our country, depends on young men and women who know these things. And we must teach them. I know this begins with parents. And I know that is easy for a politician to say. Mark Twain once commented, ``To do good is noble. To instruct others in doing good is just as noble, and much easier.'' But the message of our society must be clear. When a man or woman has a child, being a father or mother becomes their most important job in life. Not all teachers are parents, but all parents are teachers. Family is the first school of manners and morals. And the compass of conscience is usually the gift of a caring parent. Yet parents should expect schools to be allies in the moral education of children. The lessons of the home must be reinforced by the standards of the school--standards of safety, discipline and decency. Effective character education should not just be an hour a week on a school's virtue of the month. Effective character education is fostered in schools that have confidence in their own rules and values. Schools that set limits, enforce boundaries, teach high ideals, create habits of good conduct. Children take the values of the adult worlds seriously when adults take those values seriously. And this goal sets an agenda for our nation. First, we must do everything in our power to ensure the safety of our children. When children and teenagers go to school afraid of being bullied, or beaten, or worse, it is the ultimate betrayal of adult responsibility. It communicates the victory of moral chaos. In an American school year there are more than 4,000 rapes or cases of sexual battery; 7,000 robberies; and 11,000 physical attacks involving a weapon. And these are overall numbers. For children attending inner-city schools, the likelihood of being a victim of violence is roughly five times greater than elsewhere. It is a sign of the times that the same security company used by the U.S. Mint and the FBI has now branched out into high-school security. Surveying this scene, it is easy to forget that there is actually a federal program designed to confront school violence. It's called the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The program spends about $600 million dollars a year, assisting 97 percent of the nation's school districts. What's missing from the program is accountability. Nobody really knows how the money is spent, much less whether it is doing any good. One newspaper found that federal money had gone to pay for everything from motivational speakers to clowns to school puppet shows to junkets for school administrators. As president, I will propose major changes in this program. Every school getting this funding will report their results-- measured in student safety. Those results will be public. At schools that are persistently dangerous, students will be given a transfer to some other school--a safe school. No parent in America--no matter their income--should be forced to send their child to a school where violence reigns. No child in America--regardless of background--should be forced to risk their lives in order to learn. In the same way, it is a federal crime for a student to bring a gun into any public school. Yet this law has been almost completely ignored by federal prosecutors in recent years. Of some 3,900 violations reported between 1997 and 1998, only 13 were prosecuted. It is easy to propose laws. Sometimes it is easy to pass laws. But the measure of our seriousness is enforcing the law. And the safety of our children merits more than lip service. Here is what I'll do. We will form a new partnership of the federal government and states--called Project Sentry. With some additional funding for prosecutors and the ATF, we can enforce the law and prosecute the violators: students who use guns illegally or bring guns to school, and adults who provide them. And for any juvenile found guilty of a serious gun offense, there will be a lifetime ban on carrying or purchasing a gun--any gun, for any reason, at any age, ever. Tougher enforcement of gun laws will help to make our schools safer. But safety is not the only goal here. The excellence of a school is not just measured by declines in robbery, murder, and aggravated assault. Safety is the first and urgent step toward a second order of business--instilling in all of our public schools the virtues of discipline. More than half of secondary-school teachers across the country say they have been threatened, or shouted at, or verbally abused by students. A teacher in Los Angeles describes her job as ``nine-tenths policeman, one-tenth educational.'' And many schools, intimidated by the threat of lawsuits, have watered down their standards of behavior. In Oklahoma, a student who stabbed a principal with a nail was suspended for three days. In North Carolina, a student who broke her teacher's arm was suspended for only two days. In too many cases, adults are in authority, but they are not in control. To their credit, many schools are trying to reassert that control--only to find themselves in court. Generations of movies from The Blackboard Jungle to Stand and Deliver cast as their hero the teacher who dares to bring discipline to the classroom. But a modern version of this drama would have to include a new figure in the story--the lawyer. Thirty-one percent of all high schools have faced lawsuits or out-of-court settlements in the past 2 years. This is seriously deterring discipline, and demands a serious response. In school districts receiving federal school safety funds, we will expect a policy of zero-tolerance for persistently disruptive behavior. This means simply that teachers will have the authority to remove from their classroom any student who persists in being violent or unruly. Only with the teacher's consent will these students be allowed to return. The days of timid pleading and bargaining and legal haggling with disruptive students must be over. Learning must no longer be held hostage to the brazen behavior of a few. Along with this measure, I will propose a Teacher Protection Act to free teachers, principals and school board members from meritless federal lawsuits when they enforce reasonable rules. School officials, acting in their official duties, must be shielded from liability. A lifetime dedicated to teaching must not be disrupted by a junk lawsuit. We do not need tort lawyers scouring the halls of our schools-- turning every classroom dispute into a treasure hunt for damage awards. Safety and discipline are essential. But when we dream for our children, we dream with higher goals. We want them to love learning. And we want them to be rich in character and blessed in ideals. So our third goal is to encourage clear instruction in right and wrong. We want our schools to care about the character of our children. I am not talking about schools promoting a particular set of religious beliefs. Strong values are shared by good people of different faiths, of varied backgrounds. I am talking about communicating the values we share, in all our diversity. Respect. Responsibility. Self-restraint. Family commitment. Civic duty. Fairness. Compassion. The moral landmarks that guide a successful life. There are a number of good programs around the country that show how values can be taught in a diverse nation. At St. Leonard's Elementary School in Maryland, children take a pledge each morning to be ``respectful, responsible and ready to learn.'' Character education is a theme throughout the curriculum--in writing, social studies and reading. And discipline referrals were down by 70 percent in one year. At Marion Intermediate school in South Carolina, virtues are taught by studying great historical figures and characters in literature. Consideration is encouraged, good manners are expected. And discipline referrals are down by half in one year. The federal government now spends $8 million on promoting character education efforts. My administration will triple that funding--money for states to train teachers and incorporate character lessons into daily coursework. We will require federal youth and juvenile justice programs to incorporate an element of character building. Our government must get its priorities straight when it comes to the character of our children. Right now, the Department of Health and Human Services spends far more on teen contraception than it does on teen abstinence. It takes the jaded view that children are nothing more than the sum of their drives, with no higher goal than hanging out and hooking up. We owe them better than this--and they are better than this. They ask for bread, and we give them a stone. Abstinence programs show real promise--exactly because more and more teenagers understand that true love waits. My administration will elevate abstinence education from an afterthought to an urgent goal. We should spend at least as much each year on promoting the conscience of our children as we do on providing them with contraception. As well, we will encourage and expand the role of charities in after-school programs. Everyone agrees there is a problem in these empty, unsupervised hours after school. But those hours should not only be filled with sports and play, they should include lessons in responsibility and character. The federal government already funds afterschool programs. But charities and faith-based organizations are prevented from participating. In my administration they will be invited to participate. Big Brothers/Big Sisters, the YMCA and local churches and synagogues and mosques should be a central part of voluntary, after-school programs. Schools must never impose religion--but they must not oppose religion either. And the federal government should not be an enemy of voluntary expressions of faith by students. Religious groups have a right to meet before and after school. Students have a right to say grace before meals, read their Bibles, wear Stars of David and crosses, and discuss religion with other willing students. Students have a right to express religious ideas in art and homework. Public schools that forbid these forms of religious expression are confused. But more than that, they are rejecting some of the best and finest influences on young lives. It is noble when a young mind finds meaning and wisdom in the Talmud or Koran. It is good and hopeful when young men and women ask themselves what would Jesus do. The measure of our nation's greatness has never been affluence or influence--rising stocks or advancing armies. It has always been found in citizens of character and compassion. And so many of our problems as a nation--from drugs, to deadly diseases, to crime--are not the result of chance, but of choice. They will only be solved by a transformation of the heart and will. This is why a hopeful and decent future is found in hopeful and decent children. That hope, of course, is not created by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress. I strongly believe our schools should reinforce good character. I know that our laws will always reflect a moral vision. But there are limits to law, set at the boundaries of the heart. It has been said: ``Men can make good laws, but laws can not make men good.'' Yet a president has a broader influence and a deeper legacy than the programs he proposes. He is more than a bookkeeper or an engineer of policy. A president is the most visible symbol of a political system that Lincoln called ``the last best hope of earth.'' The presidency, said Franklin Roosevelt, is ``preeminently a place of moral leadership.'' That is an awesome charge. It is the most sobering part of a decision to run for president. And it is a charge I plan to keep. After power vanishes and pride passes, this is what remains: The promises we kept. The oath we fulfilled. The example we set. The honor we earned. This is true of a president or a parent. Of a governor or a teacher. We are united in a common task: to give our children a spirit of moral courage. This is not a search for scapegoats--it is a call to conscience. It is not a hopeless task--it is the power and privilege of every generation. Every individual can change a corner of our culture. And every child is a new beginning. In all the confusion and controversy of our time, there is still one answer for our children. An answer as current as the headlines. An answer as old as the scriptures. ``Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.'' If we love our children, this is the path of duty--and the way of hope.

They settled in the region that is currently Osage County, calling the settlement Linnville but then later renamed the town more simply Linn, after the U.S. Senator Lewis F. Linn. It was in 1842 that Linn was designated the County Seat for Osage County.Here is the home of Linn State Technical College. The college was started with some of the foresight that is indicative of this region, recognizing the need for training a talented workforce. This vision has grown with the community for the last fifty years, putting technical education as an integral part of the community.Over the past century, a multitude of trades and occupations supported the town. Today, Linn is known for its diverse population, collection of many religious ideologies and exceptional school system.

2547,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I very rarely am motivated to come to the floor simultaneously with current events, thinking that it is important to reflect and learn as much as possible about a subject before one begins to orate about it on the Senate floor. I am making an exception, however, because of the extraordinarily heinous acts that have occurred in the country of Nigeria.I think it takes everyone's breath away in the United States of America that a terrorist organization--Boko Haram--would attack a secondary school in northeastern Nigeria and kidnap 200 girls. Most of these girls are not that much younger than my daughters. These were young women who wanted nothing more than to get an education. We are now told these terrorists have proudly proclaimed they will enslave these young women, they will sell them as slaves. They are proudly taking credit for this despicable and inhumane act.I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins for organizing a letter to the President to urge him to include Boko Haram in the United Nations Al Qaeda sanctions list. I thank the other Senators who introduced the resolution we passed this afternoon condemning this attack. But we have to do more.It concerns me, honestly, that this is occurring in a country where the leader not too long ago signed into law a measure that anyone entering into a homosexual relationship can be imprisoned for up to 14 years. In this same country we have a terrorist organization capturing young women and enslaving them for dollars to be child brides, proudly proclaiming that it is a sin for these young women to want to get an education, that this action was necessary to purge them of their sins and marry them off.I understand it takes all kinds of people to make up this great world. I understand there are all kinds of beliefs. But it is very hard for me to get my arms around the notion that there could be any faith that would believe kidnapping young women by the hundreds and selling them as indentured slaves to men could ever be part of any kind of faith that we should recognize. These are not people of faith; these are heinous criminals. I believe our country should look at them as archenemies of who we are as a nation and what we stand for as a government.The name of this organization means ``Western education is a sin.'' Respect for young women is not a sin. Wanting an education is not a sin. The opportunity to better oneself is not a sin.These incredible crimes that have been committed should not go unanswered, and I think it is incumbent on our Nation, with the great resources we have, to make sure we send the appropriate message to the world that this is Al Qaeda and this is our enemy--not just to our values and our way of life but, importantly, an enemy to innocent young women.I wanted to come to the floor to make this statement because I cannot imagine how the parents of these young girls must be feeling and how helpless the feeling must be. I can only hope and pray that the Government of Nigeria realizes this is a moment of truth for them. Will they stand up to this kind of extremism that is not faith? They do a disservice to their professed faith by these actions. Can this country stand up to them, can we help them stand up to them and, most importantly, can we do anything to save these young women?When I go to bed tonight I will, in my faith, thank God for my family and my children, and I will also ask for prayers for these young women in hopes they can be rescued, that they can be reunited with their desire to get educated, and that their families will not have to spend days wondering if they will ever see their children again or if their children will even survive.I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.,2015-03-17 19:10:23.597963,2015-03-17 19:10:23.597963,Senate,ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued,2014-05-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-05-06/html/CREC-2014-05-06-pt1-PgS2700.htm,67,18,160,S2700-S2706,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

2552,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from the State of Missouri. I rise to commend, thank, and praise Senator Domenici for crafting a budget resolution that we can stand up for and speak about and be grateful for. I appreciate it.The conference report balances need for responsibility, the need for setting priorities. When families gather around the kitchen table to make budgets, they set priorities. They say: If we are going to get the new car, we don't take the same vacation; we can't spend the same money twice.For too long, I think the U.S. Government, thinking that it could always just go further and further into debt or raid the Social Security trust fund, didn't have to set priorities. This is a budget that sets priorities. It sets priorities that are important.The conference report reduces the debt of this country. It will increase funding for education, it will reduce taxes, it will increase funding for national defense, and it will maintain the spending caps that are so very necessary if we are going to have the kind of discipline that keeps us from further invading the province of the next generation and their desire to be able to build their own future, instead of paying for our past. That is the real question when we decide whether we are going to have discipline in spending. It is a question of whether we will let the next generation build its dream or pay for our past.This in great measure is due to Senator Domenici's great efforts. I especially appreciate his willingness to work with his colleagues. At the start of this process, several other Senators and I sent Senator Domenici a letter asking for a budget that saved Social Security surpluses, that reduced the $3.8 trillion public debt, that pursued at least $600 billion in tax relief over the next 10 years, that maintained the statutory spending caps, and included increases in funding for both education and national defense. These were specific items that we requested in a letter addressed to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. I know the occupant of the Chair understands what was included in that letter and endorses that as well.What is gratifying about what the chairman of the Budget Committee did is that the budget that has been prepared both meets and exceeds these goals. It calls for the following: A substantial Federal tax relief package, $142 billion over the next 5 years, $778 billion over the next 10 years. The resolution requires the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to report out their tax cut plans by mid-July, a major step forward for the American people, to say to them, ``You earned it, we returned it''--instead of, ``You sent it, we spent it.'' For so long the Congress has said, ``You send it, we will spend it.'' No matter how much they sent, we spent. We viewed the American people as somehow our ``sugar daddy'' for more and more programs and greater and greater spending.I think it is high time we said to the American people: We believe in you for the future of this country, we believe in families more than we believe in bureaucracy, we believe in the private sector. You have earned so much, you have worked so hard, that we have an operating surplus down the road and we will share it with you by way of tax relief.Second, it stays within the spending caps. The spending caps have enabled us to bring the budget into balance. I am happy that this budget maintains those caps.It increases spending for education and defense. This is most important. We understand the ability to defend the country from foreign aggression and the ability for the country to have the kind of intense vigor and vitality that comes from well-trained, bright citizens. These are the two cornerposts of our existence. Education spending goes up 40 percent. The budget fully funds the $17.5 billion in defense spending requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the next 5 years. We accommodated both of those by setting priorities. Senator Domenici and the Budget Committee, including the senior Senator from the State of Missouri, have done a good job.The conference report contains an amendment which I introduced directing that this new education resource be directed to the States and local education districts and not new Federal bureaucracy. We do need to increase the bureaucracy. We need to elevate the students' performance levels; their achievement levels need to soar. We don't do that by building bureaucracy in Washington. We need to get that resource directly to the classroom. I am pleased that the conference report will contain this amendment which I proposed, saying that the increase will go to school districts in schools where parents and teachers, principals, and school administrators will make decisions--instead of bureaucracy directing it from Washington.The conference report also reduces the debt by $450 billion, $450 billion more than the President's proposal would have reduced the debt. It is time for us to reduce the publicly held debt of this country.Perhaps most importantly, this budget saves $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years for our Nation's elderly. This money is vital to shoring up the Social Security system. This stands in stark contrast to the President's plan, which spends $158 billion over 5 years of Social Security surpluses for non-Social Security purposes. On the one hand, we save $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years for our Nation's elderly; the President's program over the next 5 years alone would have spent $158 billion of Social Security surpluses for non-Social Security spending.In addition to the money that this budget saves for Social Security, the budget also takes procedural steps to build in onbudget surpluses from the year 2001 and beyond. In other words, there are Social Security surpluses saved, then there will be other surpluses that relate to the rest of the budget--and the budget is careful to make sure that those surpluses will materialize beginning in the year 2001.This is setting priorities. This is kitchen table economics. This is understanding that in order to make some things work, you have to adjust other things and you have to work them together. It is not just a wish list, this is a real spending plan. It is a spending plan that honors the next generation and the future of this great country.Under these new important procedures, Congress could no longer spend billions of dollars on so-called ``emergencies'' that were not really emergencies. These new procedures stop the mislabeling of ordinary expenses in the category of ``emergencies'' so that you could invade funds or take Social Security surplus and spend, which happened last year. There will be a point of order in this budget that says you cannot do that, you cannot mislabel, you cannot automatically categorize things as emergencies.Last year, the President and the Congress together spent $21 billion from the Social Security trust fund on these so-called emergencies. We need to stop that. We must stop that. This budget will stop that kind of practice.The conference report contains a 60-vote point of order ensuring that emergency spending will be limited to actual emergencies. In addition, surpluses that are accumulating in the Social Security trust fund will no longer be used to finance onbudget deficits in governmental operations. It is a fundamental first step of Social Security reform that the Social Security surpluses should not be used to funding deficits in the rest of government. This budget stops that.In order to establish this first step, Senator Domenici and I introduced legislation that would establish a 60-vote point of order against any budget when the Social Security surpluses are used to finance onbudget governmental deficits.I rise to say how much I appreciate the work of the chairman of the Budget Committee, the members of the Budget Committee, and their cooperation with the Members of the House to work together to bring a budget that really does what family budgets do--sets priorities, looks to the future, understands we cannot have everything all the time, but protects Social Security and its surplus, protects our budget generally from mislabeling that gets us into emergency spending which puts us into debt or raids the Social Security surplus, keeps the caps in place, elevates the capacity for spending for education, and strengthens the military. These are the fundamentals that are important to America's strength in the next century. This budget does that.There have been a number of years in which I have not voted for the budget. I haven't been able to in good conscience. I voted against last year's budget with the $21 billion raid on the Social Security trust fund. However, I will be able to vote for this budget. This is a budget for which we ought to be grateful. This is the kind of budget that we are grateful to have the opportunity to vote in favor of. I commend Senator Domenici and the other members of the Budget Committee and the House for its cooperation in getting us to a place where we can present this kind of spending plan to the people of the United States of America, for it is their money that we spend. This is a budget that they would be proud to develop, were they to sit around the table and make those kinds of hard-nosed judgments about the Nation that they make regularly about their families.I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:10:24.420555,2015-03-17 19:10:24.420555,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT,1999-04-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-14/html/CREC-1999-04-14-pt1-PgS3676.htm,51,23,145,S3676-S3687,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2553,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you, Madam President. I congratulate the majority leader, Senator Lott, for helping bring this matter to a place where it can be debated and where this reform in the IDEA law can, in fact, be implemented.I want to thank a number of individuals who worked on this: Senator Jeffords, Senator Harkin, a wide variety of others; my colleague from the State of Missouri, Senator Bond has been active in working to make sure we had the right components.I am grateful that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, S. 717, is before us, and that we will have a chance to vote on it. I believe its passage would result in a substantial improvement in the ability to deal with disruptive individuals. The committee chairman was speaking about that just a few moments ago. Last year, I objected to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, commonly known as IDEA, passing into law because I believed there were problems regarding discipline and discipline records of students that needed to be remedied. We worked those out at the close of the session last year in some rather arduous negotiations. This year I continued to work with the IDEA working group to get improvements in this regard that will make it possible for us to have safer school districts, safer school rooms, and safer environments in which students can learn and teachers can teach.Schools need to provide a safe learning environment. Fear is not an emotion that is consistent with a learning environment. We need, regardless of whether a student was disabled or not, to be able to have appropriate disciplinary measures that would enable us to have learning environments which would be effective.One of the problems that really had troubled me about our previous situation and will trouble me until it is corrected by this reform or some other, is the problem that discipline records frequently did not transfer with students from one school to the next. When a student arrives at a new campus without the discipline record, the following results can be disastrous.There is a case in Missouri where those results were fatal.My own interest in this particular area of the law was occasioned by an outrageous incident which I think shocked the conscience of virtually everyone who was aware of it. Two years ago, in my home State of Missouri, a 15-year-old young woman was at her high school. She had gone to the girl's restroom when a student with a learning disability and behavior disorder followed her into the restroom, and that was the beginning of a series of events which eventually led to her losing her life, after other unspeakable things were done.This incident occurred on the disabled student's second day at the school where the incident occurred. He had been transferred from another school in accordance with IDEA procedures, but when this incident occurred the officials at the school where the assault took place say they were not aware of the prior disciplinary history.The chronology of events leading up to this horrific incident are very troubling.In September 1994, the disabled student was enrolled as a ninth grade student at one high school.In October 1994, the disabled student exhibited uncooperative behavior in class. He was the prime suspect of vandalism in the classroom. He was suspected of urinating on objects in the classroom.Later that same month, the 15-year-old student was suspended pending a psychological evaluation by the district psychologist after being found in the girl's restroom. This is obviously not behavior which was unrelated to what eventually happened.You go through a wide variety of other chronological events which finally find the student being transferred to another school, the school at which the death of the young woman occurred, at his hands and in another restroom. But the school officials did not have the information of the previous disciplinary incidents as a part of the transfer.I felt it essential--I felt it would be totally inappropriate for us to allow a so-called reform to go into effect and allow students to precede their disciplinary records. The incident in Missouri demonstrates dramatically that if you precede your record by as much as 2 days it may be long enough for another student to lose his or her life.When the officials at the second school said that they did not know about the disabled student's disciplinary past, they were pointing to a tremendous, gaping hole in the framework for safety that we ought to provide in IDEA legislation.Together with Senator Bond's and Senator Harkin's help, we have been able to address this concern. I want to thank them both and the committee chairman. I am grateful. To me, it seems that this is not the kind of thing that ought to divide us; this is the kind of thing that ought to unite us.Whenever any of the child's records are transmitted to another school, the student's discipline record and the individual education program must be included in the transmission, so that school officials and teachers will know. They will know the past disciplinary records of a disabled student on his first day in the school. They will know in time to take corrective action. They will know in time to do what they can.This will not make all of our schools perfectly safe, but it will elevate our capacity to do what we can do and ought to do by giving us timely information.Moreover, when the school or school district reports a crime to law enforcement or juvenile justice authorities, copies of the student's disciplinary records must be transmitted for consideration to that authority.In those circumstances where the public agency initiates disciplinary procedures against a student, the agency must ensure that the disciplinary records of the child with a disability are transmitted for consideration by the person or persons making the final determination.We have had a disconnect between our schools and our justice system. Frankly, it is time, when serious, dangerous behavior that literally threatens the life and safety of other individuals, we do not have an artificial barrier that keeps the education agencies from talking to the criminal justice agencies or the juvenile justice agencies. This law now provides that school officials may report incidents to proper authorities.Not long ago, in Tennessee, a student with a disability kicked a water pipe in the school lavatory until it burst, resulting in $1,000 worth of water damage.When the school officials filed the petition against the child, a hearing officer ordered the school district to dismiss its juvenile court petition, a decision which was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court faulted the school for not holding a multidisciplinary meeting before initiating a juvenile court petition.I think it is clear that if students commit crimes that are worthy of prosecution, the school should be able to file or cause to be filed a case against the students. The practical effect of the court's ruling is that schools as a matter of law cannot unilaterally refer disabled students to juvenile court for committing acts of violence unless the student consents to such referrals. So prior to filing the case, you would have to get the consent of the parents of the disabled child or a court order. Otherwise, it would not happen. It is important that we say to students: Your disabilities will not be a license for you to violate the law or threaten the health and safety and security of others.This bill moves toward abolishing a double standard for individuals who claim disabilities as a shield for potentially life threatening behavior.Regular education students are subject to a range of disciplinary actions. Disabled students, on the other hand, even those who are violent or seriously disruptive, can stay put at their current educational environment, even if the actions are criminal. This is a double standard, and has been, and it is wrong. While we want to protect disabled students from discrimination, we also have a duty to protect other children from harm.Senate bill 717 now gives greater flexibility to school officials to remove dangerous students from the current school. If the child carries a weapon to school or to a school function or if the child knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs, the bill allows school officials to move the child to an alternative interim setting for the same amount of time that a regular education student would be subject to discipline, but not for more than 45 days.Moving away from this double standard which had existed is a step in the right direction on the part of this bill.A trend developed recently under the bill, the law which we now have--which needs the reform which this bill would provide --that students would not be known as ``disabled'' or even claim disability until after they had committed some serious wrong; and after they had committed some serious wrong, to avoid penalties, they would shout: Well, I'm disabled in one way or another, either that I don't read well or that I have a kind of nervousness or even some kind of other subjective claim of disability.This measure, for which I am grateful, basically provides remedies that are fundamental to improving the environment for learning in the school.It requires that the student's disciplinary records accompany the student's individualized education program when the student transfers to another school, so no student goes to a new school without the officials at the school learning about their prior discipline history, a major achievement.Second, it holds children with violent or other bad behavior to the same disciplinary standards of other students when the behavior is unrelated to their disabilities. You cannot claim you are a slow reader and, as a result of being a slow reader, you have the right to assault another student. That simply will not cut it anymore.Third, it will allow school officials to report crimes committed by disabled students to police and juvenile authorities before meeting with the Individualized Education Program team, a special team that agrees on an education program for disabled students.It seems to me, especially since that committee is composed of individuals like family members of the student and others who would not allow the crime to be reported, that we need to give schools clear authority to make the communication with law enforcement officials when even disabled students have committed what is clearly a criminal activity.I opposed the bill last year because it did not have these safeguards.I want to commend the committee chairman, Senator Jeffords. I want to commend Bill Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, who has worked so hard on this. I want to thank my colleague Senator Bond, and Senator Harkin from our neighboring State of Iowa, for their work in this respect.I believe the bill is a substantial improvement, and when it is enacted, the young people of the United States will be safer. We have not sacrificed the rights of students with disabilities to be educated, but we have enhanced the capacity of students generally to get the kind of education they deserve.I thank the Chair.Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:10:24.589675,2015-03-17 19:10:24.589675,Senate,INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-05-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-05-12/html/CREC-1997-05-12-pt1-PgS4311-2.htm,61,20,143,S4311-S4319,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2554,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2352, the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009. This legislation reauthorizes some of the SBA's most critical programs, those that prepare America's entrepreneurs to start and maintain successful small businesses.The Small Business Administration, or the SBA, accomplishes this important mission through its Office of Entrepreneurial Development and its use of programs such as Small Business Development Centers, or SBDCs; the Women's Business Centers, WBC; the Service Corps of Retired Executives, or SCORE; the Office of Veterans Business Development; the Office of Native American Affairs; and its distance learning program. These programs have not been reauthorized in a comprehensive way in nearly 10 years, and given the changes in the economy, it is long overdue.Starting and maintaining a successful business has always been a daunting task, fraught with unforeseen and unavoidable problems and pitfalls for American entrepreneurs. In the past, a solid business plan, a loan from friends or a banker that you knew and good old-fashioned hard work was a recipe for success. The entrepreneurial development programs at the SBA were available to assist fledgling and seasoned small business owners in navigating the difficult entrepreneurial terrain of developing a business plan and growing their businesses.However, times are more difficult now. Financing is harder to get. Competition does not just come from the business down the street but comes from businesses all around the world. In acknowledgment of these new challenges and their need for immediate attention, the Job Creation Through Entrepreneurship Act of 2009 addresses the changing climate for entrepreneurs and makes minor tweaks to programs that have a record of success.These programs are even more critical today as the country's economy is more focused on small businesses. As more large corporations begin to close or downsize, many more Americans have chosen to go into business for themselves and are in need of the type of guidance the entrepreneurial development programs at the SBA provide.But it is not just fledgling entrepreneurs and those downsized from large corporations who have the desire to run their own businesses. When the men and women who have chosen to serve their country honorably in the armed services leave, they are faced with beginning new careers. Often they choose to serve their country in another way. These Americans frequently choose to open up a small business and contribute to the growth of America's economy. For these great Americans, we must provide them with the very best training to make their transition to civilian life as equally secure.This bill seeks to expand and improve the educational and training resources provided by the SBA to our veterans. Although the SBA currently runs a veterans outreach and education program, no such program is authorized under the Small Business Act. This legislation would correct that and expand the number of centers available to serve our veterans. It is a small price to pay for the sacrifice they have made for us.Many aspiring entrepreneurs live in rural areas or work out of their homes. Neither may have access to physical locations at which the SBA and its partners offer education and training. Given today's technology, we can provide these entrepreneurs with appropriate education through quality distance learning programs. H.R. 2352 requires the SBA, working with private vendors, to develop online courses that will educate entrepreneurs about starting and expanding their businesses, including having the opportunity to obtain online counseling from other business owners.Often forgotten are our Native Americans located in very remote areas of the country. They, too, can contribute to economic growth if they have access to education and training programs offered by the SBA. H.R. 2352 codifies the Office of Native American Affairs at the SBA and directs that office to expand its service to Native Americans through the use of Tribal Business Information Centers. These centers will provide entrepreneurial education programs that meet the unique needs of Native Americans.The broadest effort at entrepreneurial development is the Small Business Development Center program, a joint program between the SBA and institutions of higher learning. Changes in the bill modernize the management and establish, without risk to core funding, competitive grant programs designed to provide businesses with the best practices for things such as raising capital in constricted lending markets.Half of all small business owners are women. Many small business owners who are women have benefited from training they have received at Women's Business Centers over the years and, as a result, have made great contributions to their communities. This bill makes several changes to the Women's Business Centers to ensure that they are functioning at their optimum level and reaching as many women as possible. In addition, the bill also makes provisions to ensure that the centers are on a sound path to self-sufficiency.This will free up funds to allow new centers to open and serve areas not currently served by the Women's Business Centers.These entrepreneurial programs frequently rely on the dedication of volunteers. Advice from executives, whether active or retired, proves invaluable to small business owners.The SCORE Program at the SBA oversees a core of 11,000 knowledgeable volunteers willing to offer guidance to small business owners. It is an effective program that should offer more services. H.R. 2352 does just that by expanding the ability of SCORE to offer greater outreach and improved counseling to small business owners.It is obvious that the SBA operates a number of entrepreneurial development programs. Many provide an overlapping service. While it is important to ensure that small businesses are receiving the necessary training, it is also important that these programs operate in the most efficient manner possible. And this bill before us requires the SBA to increase its oversight of these programs, improve coordination, eliminate waste and duplication.Mr. Chairman, this legislation makes critical changes to vital programs at a critical time. And, in short, this bill sharpens already existing tools employed by the SBA to cultivate one of our Nation's greatest natural resources, its entrepreneurs. Mr. Shuler and my fellow Missourian, Mr. Luetkemeyer, should be commended for their work on this bill. And I would like to thank the chairwoman very much for her bipartisan efforts in moving this key bill through the committee. I'd also like to thank Ms. Fallin, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Schock and Mr. Thompson for their vital contributions to this legislation. And I'd encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation with me.,2015-03-17 19:10:24.743786,2015-03-17 19:10:24.743786,House,JOB CREATION THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF 2009,2009-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-05-20/html/CREC-2009-05-20-pt1-PgH5842-4.htm,78,2,155,H5842-H5860,G000546,mr. graves
2555,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off of the resolution, not on this point in specific.I have a desire to talk about an amendment, No. 4012, the Harkin amendment, which cuts other committees and adds $2.7 billion to the Labor, HHS subcommittee. I say that for the information of any of my colleagues who may wish to join in.Let me just say in respect to the discussions we have had, very important discussions over the procedure in the Budget Act, I disagree with the ranking member on the other side, who ascribes politics to the process and to the Parliamentarian. I think it is time we had some good policy, because in the past this body, with the active involvement of the Presidents of the United States, has run up a $5 trillion debt, almost $18,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country.We are in the process of threatening the disability of our Government budget and the economy of this country as a whole if we do not pass a budget that responsibly gets us on a path to balance in the near future. The budget resolution before us proposes to do that. It is a difficult budget. It is not easy, but I believe it is one that merits support.There was discussion about the budget the President supported. That budget has been voted down. That budget proposed spending and said if it did not get to zero deficit in 2002, several automatic actions should be taken. Those automatic actions lead to about a $16 billion tax increase and increase in spectrum fees, which would come to a middle-class tax increase in 2002, plus $67 billion in cuts in domestic discretionary programs that would be extremely painful and, frankly, from what we have heard from some of the administration officials, they may even have no intention of pursuing.Let me get back to the budget that is before us and, in particular, the Harkin-Specter amendment. This amendment, No. 4012, proposes to increase by $2.7 billion the amount in the functions for education, training and social services and for health activities. Everybody likes to be for education and for health care. That sounds very appealing. But that takes money out of other budgets that have been strapped--and severely strapped in the past. I note that it takes money out of the defense budget in many areas where there is no fat. It takes money, in specific, out of the budget for the Veterans' Administration and EPA, where we have suffered great cuts in the past.Last year there was a rescission of $7 billion out of the funding for the VA, HUD, EPA subcommittee. Then, in the appropriations bills, there was about an $8 billion cut in these functions. Here the amendment before us would take more money from those functions and add it to the Labor, HHS subcommittee. Frankly, that budget under this bill before us would go up slightly for education. Certainly, we all like education. But the problem is very serious when you take a look at where this money would have to come from.The proponents of this amendment say it will come out of administrative costs. This amendment says nothing about administrative costs. It just takes $1.2 billion out of one place, $1.5 billion out of another, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion. It does not say anything about administrative costs. It does not define any fat.The cuts that were taken in the VA, HUD, EPA subcommittee last year were draconian cuts. We had to look everywhere we could to find ways to cut low-priority programs to enable us to fund the major programs funded in EPA and Veterans' Administration. Just last week, this body voted overwhelmingly, 75 to 23, against very severe cuts that the President had proposed to take out of veterans medical care.In addition, I think every Member of this body will recall that during the debates on the 1996 appropriations bill, the current-year spending bills, everybody wanted to spend more on the environment. Everybody had something more they wanted to add to environmental spending. Let me make it quite clear that if this amendment is adopted, the money is going to come out of the environment and/or Veterans' Administration health care. There is no other pot for it to come out of. There is no category of administrative costs and administrative waste that is going to be reduced. This money is going to come out of the environment and/or veterans health care.I know everybody would like to put more money in education. Certainly, I would as well. But after the battles that we have had here, to try to get the funds increased to carry out the vital environmental programs that the EPA is charged with, I would be very surprised if people will vote to cut the environment, and then they will come back to this floor when we are debating the bill itself and say, ``Why can't we put more money in the environment?''Mr. President, a vote for the Harkin amendment is a vote to take money out of the environment. It is a vote to take money out of VA medical care. These are the critical priorities that would be hit if this measure is to be adopted.I strongly urge my colleagues not to support this amendment. It reflects some serious changes from the judgment made by the Budget Committee and it will take down funding, approximately $430 million cut for HUD-VA would be just about equal to the increase planned for VA medical care, or it would equal about one-half of the planned Superfund reserve fund increase.These are vital priorities that have been debated on this floor in the past. We spent many months working to find additional offsets to put money into the environment. And if any of my colleagues are interested in the environment and are concerned about assuring that we have adequate funds to protect the environment, to clean it up, to leave the kind of environment we want to leave for our children, I urge them not to support this amendment to take money out of the environment.Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I yield the floor.Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:10:24.889883,2015-03-17 19:10:24.889883,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET,1996-05-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-21/html/CREC-1996-05-21-pt1-PgS5413.htm,72,103,142,S5413-S5442,B000611,mr. bond
2556,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, the St. Louis Post Dispatch recently published a series of articles to shed light on music education in the St. Louis Public Schools. The significant benefits conveyed by music education are immeasurable. Studies have found that education in the arts leads to success in society, school and life. I applaud the St. Louis Public Schools for recognizing the value of music education. I also commend Mr. Bob Dorries, the instrumental music teacher at McKinley Junior Classical Academy, a St. Louis magnet school, for his commitment to cultivating the gift of music in our children. I was especially impressed with the article's coverage of sixth-grader Sydney Everett's intense desire to master playing the clarinet.In reading Steve Giegerich's articles, it is obvious that Sydney is an exceptional student who is dedicated to conquering new objectives and realizing her full potential. Sydney's love for music was instilled by her parents Sean and Deirdre Everett. They have always made music a part of Sydney's life. Her father, having taught himself to play the trumpet, shared his love for music with his children. Sydney exhibits that same drive and frequently takes the initiative to teach herself lessons before the class covers them.Madam Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Sydney Everett today before Congress. I encourage Sydney to continue her studies and remain committed to exploring new horizons.The two articles from the St. Louis Post Dispatch chronicling Sydney's journey to master playing the clarinet follow this tribute.It's no accident that a poster of Miles Davis is in the sight line of Bob Dorries' students as he stands at the blackboard to review scales, time signatures and other rudiments of music education at McKinley Classical Junior Academy. Dorries put it there as a constant reminder of the link between the East St. Louis jazz icon and the potential heirs to his legacy who pass through Dorries' classroom each day. The connection is pretty much lost on the majority of sixth-graders enrolled in the instrumental music program at the St. Louis magnet middle school. Most don't know Miles Davis from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The exception is an intense young girl in Dorries' seventh- period band class. Sydney Everett required no introduction to Davis, the man who provided much of the soundtrack for her childhood. As parents, Sean and Deirdre Everett's priorities were established far in advance of Sydney's arrival on March 30, 1995. ``Education has been the goal since her birth,'' said Deirdre. The motivation came in part by the failure to realize their own potential. Both Sean and Deirdre had left college without a degree. ``I always felt I didn't take full advantage of all I had,'' said Sean. ``Now I look at the way the world is going, and you have to have that degree.'' From the moment she was born, music danced on the periphery of Sydney's life. Her father had developed an eclectic taste in music as his family moved from one military base to another across the country. ``I listen to it all,'' he said. And the Everetts made sure their children did the same. Sydney and her brother, Sean Michael, their father said, ``have an open mind toward music and life, too. I want them to experience everything possible.'' Between the birth of his first and second children, Sean bought a used trumpet at a secondhand store. Though he'd dabbled with the guitar in high school, he'd never learned to read music. He still can't. But he taught himself to play that trumpet by emulating chords and riffs of the musician he admires above all others: Miles Davis. When Sean Everett's daughter took a seat in Dorries' band room a month ago, her own experience as a musician was limited to a month of piano lessons, family Karaoke sing- alongs at Christmastime and a class at Kennard Elementary School that taught the 12-tone musical scale. Over the summer, Sydney toyed with the idea of enrolling in McKinley's vocal music program, a notion she ultimately rejected. ``I knew I couldn't sing,'' she said. On the day she walked into Dorries' class for the first time, Sydney was just as sure she knew which instrument she wanted to play: the trumpet, like her dad. ``Just to hear music in the house will be nice,'' said Sean Everett. ``Music opens up so many horizons. She'll meet so many characters playing music, and it's such a release. Who knows? She could wind up joining an orchestra, seeing the world.'' Before that can happen, Sydney must learn an instrument. Learning To Play: Gifted Students Get New Mountain To ScaleNo one will ever confuse Bob Dorries with Harold Hill, the mythical Music Man who, in another River City, bamboozled parents with the belief that their children could play double bell euphoniums and big bassoons--not to mention 76 trombones--without learning a single note of music. Dorries is a fundamentalist. Not in the religious sense, but of the doctrine that music is a gift learned slowly and methodically through repetition. For Dorries, the instrumental music teacher at McKinley Junior Classical Academy, a St. Louis magnet school for academically talented students, ``Sixth grade is a kind of band boot camp.'' Boot camp rule No. 1: Every student must pass an exam testing his or her grasp of musical history, notation scales, time signatures, flats and sharps. Those who pass are paired with an instrument. Those who fail are destined to take the exam until they get it right. For nearly 2 weeks, the first rule produced a divide in Dorries' seventh-period, sixth-grade instrumental music class. On one side, the successful test-takers, B-flat clarinetist Sydney Everett and alto saxophonists Megan Ratcliff and Nick Wiegand, attacked the beginning exercises in Book One of the ``Standard of Excellence--Comprehensive Band Method'' and its companion CD. Across the room, the others found inspiration and passed the test one by one. All things being relative, Sydney was virtuoso by the time Jonathan Brooks added a trombone, Shaunice Safford a flute, Kaelan Moorehead a B-flat clarinet and Wolfgang Fortel a trumpet to the seventh-period ensemble. That Sydney's virtuosity occurred on a clarinet was a bit unexpected. Sydney had intended to take up the trumpet, the instrument her father had played during her formative years. Her dream of emulating her dad and Miles Davis ended when Dorries determined that the shape of her mouth was more conducive to a woodwind. Upon receiving her instrument, Sydney had no problem adhering to boot camp rule No.2: self- discipline. ``I only have you twice a week for 50 minutes,'' Dorries points out at least, well, twice a week. ``I can help you when you're here. But there's seven of you and one of me.'' Translation: The real learning takes place 30 minutes at a time. And it takes place at home. Due diligence is documented in practice reports, signed by parents and delivered to Dorries every other week. The exemplary practice reports are posted on a ``Wall of Fame.'' Less-than-satisfactory reports land on a ``Wall of Shame.'' Dorries is characteristically blunt: Kids who don't practice won't participate in rehearsals, won't perform in concert and won't pass his class. Quiet and intense by nature, Sydney exhibited a preternatural ability to figure things out on her own from the time she was in prekindergarten. When she took up the clarinet this year, there was little need for her parents, Shawn and Deirdre Everett, to remind their daughter to practice. Barely a week after receiving her clarinet, Sydney jumped ahead in the book to teach herself ``Hot Cross Buns,'' a song incorporating the three notes--E-C-D she'd learned to date. So, too, had Megan, who'd also skipped to the lesson in her saxophone book. Best friends since first grade, Sydney and Megan are equals in all ways but one: When it comes to decibels, Megan's instrument trumps Sydney's. ``I don't like the music we play in class that much because I can't hear myself,'' said Sydney. ``It's the CD and Megan. They drown me out.'' Along with classmate Nick--who learned the rudiments of his saxophone over the summer--Megan and Sydney established themselves as the tone-setters (so to speak) of the seventh period.,2015-03-17 19:10:25.144070,2015-03-17 19:10:25.144070,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO SYDNEY EVERETT,2007-03-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-03-14/html/CREC-2007-03-14-pt1-PgE541.htm,44,0,153,E541-E543,C001049,mr. clay
2557,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, in the past two weeks since the tragedy occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, we have all had time to reflect on a number of issues. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families, friends, and other loved ones affected by this incident. We have asked ourselves why this happened. How it happened.The Littleton tragedy requires reflection, thought and corrective action within our spheres of influence and responsibility. Children must learn respect and responsibility. Parents must be responsible for their children, including what they watch and what they do. Schools must have firm, fair and consistent discipline policies. Schools must be free to expel violence-prone students. State legislators must review state laws. Congress must review federal laws.As a member of the United States Senate, I have been prompted to stop and examine our current federal education laws involving school safety, and see if our policies are promoting and encouraging school safety--or are in some way hindering our teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, and school boards from maintaining a safe place for our children to learn and our teachers to teach.For much of the past year and before the Littleton tragedy, I traveled through Missouri talking to teachers, principals, school superintendents and school officials about the issue of school safety and school discipline. What I heard and learned was disturbing. After listening to school officials, I have concluded that there is, in fact, at least one federal law that actually jeopardizes our schools' efforts to provide a safe learning environment. Today I am introducing legislation, the School Safety Act, to amend this law and give schools the ability to remove from the classroom students who possess weapons or threaten to use weapons in the classroom, so that we can keep our children and teachers safe.Once enacted, this legislation will help foster a safer environment in schools. If this legislation had been enacted years ago, would it have prevented the Littleton tragedy? It would be wrong to claim for certain that it would. The truth of the Littleton tragedy is that those involved in the massacre violated at least 13 federal laws. The existence of those 13 laws did not stop the Littleton massacre. Still, we must examine our current federal education laws involving school safety and make necessary changes.Across America, parents, teachers, and communities have made it clear that we want our schools to offer our students a world-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. If children are to attain high levels of academic performance, our schools must be able to provide safe and secure learning environments free of undue disruption or violence.When we think of school safety, we obviously turn to one element that poses a threat to a secure environment: weapons in schools.Our general federal policy is commendable: to have zero tolerance for weapons at schools. The federal Gun-Free Schools Act requires states receiving federal education funds to have a law requiring a one year expulsion of a student who has a weapon at school. I know that my state of Missouri has such a law on the books.We would think that the Gun-Free Schools Act settles the issue of weapons in schools. But it doesn't. This law contains an exception for nearly one in seven students in my state, and one in eight nationally. This exception is for students covered by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.Hidden among the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act is section (c), entitled ``Special Rule,'' which says: ``The provisions of this section shall be construed in a manner consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' When you turn to the IDEA law, you see a complex and elaborate set of roadblocks and barriers that hamstring schools in applying discipline to any IDEA student for situations involving weapons possessions.When we talk about students who are subject to the IDEA law, we are not talking about any small number of children: In Missouri, over 129,000--or nearly 14% of our 893,000 students--are classified as ``disabled.'' That's one in seven students. Nationally, there are about 12-13% of all students who are under the IDEA law. We have to keep this in mind as we talk about this issue of school discipline and safety.We must also consider which individuals qualify as ``disabled'' under IDEA. We are not just talking about blindness, deafness, orthopedic impairments, or MS. The federal IDEA definition of disability also includes individuals with serious emotional disturbances or specific learning disabilities.Unlike the Gun-Free Schools Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act does not have a zero tolerance for students with weapons. In fact, the IDEA law makes it very difficult for schools to act effectively when a student subject to this law has a weapon at school.While the Gun-Free Schools Act would require that any other student be expelled for a year, the ``special rule'' for an IDEA student who brings a gun or knife to school provides that he could be back in the regular classroom within 45 days.Here is a federal law that creates dangerous situations by not allowing school officials to keep those students who have possessed weapons in school out of the classroom.IDEA also hinders schools from taking effective action to protect their students and teachers from students who make threats to use weapons. School districts have developed policies to address student weapons threats. For example, a superintendent in my state told my office that under his school district's policy, he could suspend a student for up to 180 days for threatening to bring a weapon to school and shoot another student.However, if that superintendent is dealing with a student under IDEA, the law makes it very difficult for him to remove the student even if he considers the student a serious threat to the safety of others. In fact, the school may be unable to remove this child from the classroom if he has already been suspended for a certain number of days during the school year.Here is a federal law that creates dangerous situations by not allowing school officials to act on early warning signs to remove potentially violent students from school.The costs involved with trying to keep a dangerous child out of the classroom are astronomical under IDEA. Schools have told me that the ``due process'' proceedings a parent can invoke in response to any disciplinary action taken toward a child is so expensive and time-consuming that schools do all they can to avoid these proceedings. The easiest, simplest due process hearing costs a school about $7500 in Missouri!Not only must schools pay their own legal fees for a due process hearing under IDEA, but they also face the prospect of being responsible for the parents' attorneys fees in some cases.Here is a federal law that discourages safe classrooms because schools cannot afford to take steps they deem essential to maintaining safety without risking serious financial jeopardy.The problems created by IDEA are not simply theoretical. Just three weeks ago--before the Littleton incident--I traveled around Missouri to talk to parents, teachers, principals, and administrators about ways to offer each child a world class education. Again and again, I was told that schools are handcuffed by federal law in dealing with violent and dangerous behavior--often connected with weapons. Let me give you a few examples:In one rural Missouri school, a 15-year-old IDEA student had been making numerous threats against both students and staff. He said such things as, ``I'm going to shoot you. I'm going to get a gun and blow you away.'' School officials were aware of the threats, but the federal law hindered them from taking steps they thought most appropriate to deal with the student. Unfortunately this student ended up shooting another student off school grounds. Fortunately, because he remained in the custody of law enforcement authorities, the student was not returned to the classroom. School officials in this district told me that had this student not been subject to the IDEA laws, they could have--and would have--removed him from the classroom when he made the threats of killing other students and personnel.In an eastern Missouri school district, an IDEA student who was under school suspension was asked to leave a Friday night school dance that he tried to attend in violation of school policy. The student tried continually to regain entry into the school and said to the principal, a teacher, and a parent who was helping supervise the dance: ``I'm going to go home, get my shotgun, come back, and blow your [expletives deleted] heads off.'' The superintendent says that the federal IDEA law constrained him to return this potentially dangerous student to the classroom early the next week. If the student had not had been under IDEA, the superintendent could have imposed a far longer suspension for threatening school personnel.I learned of a Missouri grade schooler, subject to IDEA law, who announced at school, ``I'm going to bring a knife and cut the bus driver's throat.'' Was this an idle threat? This child had transferred from another school where he had been found with a knife and was suspended for 10 days. The federal IDEA law prevents this new school from imposing any more suspensions upon this child for the rest of the school year unless he actually shows up with a weapon again!Let me emphasize that the vast majority of disabled students under the IDEA law--just like the vast majority of nondisabled students--are good kids who don't pose discipline problems in school. However, when it comes to something as serious as a student bringing a weapon to school or threatening to kill or harm someone with a weapon, school officials must have the ability to respond in the way they believe most appropriate to maintain a safe and stable school for all children.When I hear these incidents from Missouri schools, I cannot help but think that there is something drastically wrong with our federal education laws. We have a mass tragedy waiting to happen if federal law keeps teachers from getting teenagers with weapons out of schools. We cannot afford to keep laws on the books that preclude schools from dealing with early warning signs of danger and handcuff them from taking swift action to prevent violence. We must give schools the power to keep our children safe by allowing them to remove all students who have weapons or threaten to use them.Schools all over my state have told me that they need the authority to discipline all students in a fair and consistent manner--for the safety of their schools and for the benefit of disabled children. Here are some examples of what schools have told me:Maynard Wallace, Superintendent of the Ava R-I School District, has written: ``The discipline code must be the same for all if public education is to survive.'' He says that treating children with handicaps differently than other children in the area of discipline ``not only undermines the entire discipline of the school but is a definite disservice to the handicapped child as well.''Betty Chong, Assistant Superintendent for Special Services in the Cape Girardeau school district, writes: ``The educators are themselves advocates for children with disabilities. . . . Special educators directors and many principals were first teachers who were dedicated (and still are) to the education of students with disabilities.'' She goes on to say: ``Students with disabilities are held to the same standards as students without disabilities when they are adults. When do they learn how to be law abiding citizens?''Lyle Laughman, the superintendent of the Lincoln County R-IV school district has written: ``It is in the total best interest of the child and society for that [discipline] determination to be made on the local, individual case level rather than the Federal law which greatly restricts what a school can do in an individual set of circumstances.''Dale Walkup, Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School District gave me a copy of a letter he sent to President Clinton which says, ``The reauthorization of IDEA has not supported impartial and appropriate consequences for those students who choose drugs and are violent or dangerous to others. We hope the IDEA regulations become more reasonable, appropriate, and considerate of the needs of our total student population.''In response to both the incidents and recommendations that I have heard from schools, I am introducing the School Safety Act, which will allow schools to remove from the classroom any student who has a weapon or threatens to use a weapon at school. This legislation, which has been endorsed by the Missouri School Boards Association, will repeal the federal law that handcuffs schools from taking measures they believe appropriate to maintain a safe and secure learning environment for students and teachers.A safe and secure setting is vital to success in the classroom. Any student who has a weapon at school, or who threatens to kill or harm someone with a weapon, should be removed from the classroom immediately. Whether a student is ``disabled'' under federal law should not prevent school administrators from dealing appropriately with weapons in school. We can no longer afford to keep a federal law that threatens the safety of the classroom. We can no longer afford to tolerate federal policy that invites a mass tragedy. Under the School Safety Act, schools will be empowered with the flexibility and authority they need to remove any dangerous and violent student from the classroom when weapons are involved.This is not the first time I have introduced school safety legislation since I have been in the Senate. I have already worked to make improvements in the federal law to create a safer learning environment for students and teachers.I began working on this issue in 1995, after a young woman was found dead in the restroom of a North St. Louis County high school. The male special education student convicted of murdering the woman had a history of dangerous behavior, but his discipline record hadn't been disclosed to his new school. In response to this situation, I sought for ways to give schools the crucial information they need to maintain a secure school environment. I authored legislation signed into law in June 1997 providing for the transfer of discipline records when students with dangerous behavior change schools.In the recent ``ed-flex'' bill signed into law on April 29, 1999, I secured a provision that closes a loophole in federal law concerning weapons possession in school. Missouri school board officials had alerted me to a federal provision that allows a school to discipline a student only for carrying a weapon onto school grounds, but not for possessing a weapon at school. In response to this concern, I had the law amended to ensure that school officials can remove a student from the classroom whether he possesses--or carries--a weapon at school.The legislation I am offering today builds upon this previous safe schools legislation by giving schools authority to remove any student from the classroom if he or she brings a weapon to school or threatens to kill or harm someone with a weapon.Mr. President, a little over a year ago, the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, read from an editorial in the Seattle Post Intelligencer that recounted the story of a disabled student who attacked other students with a knife on a school bus. The editorial pointed out the disparities caused by the federal IDEA laws. It said: ``If the school district really is required by law to allow students back into class who carry weapons or otherwise have demonstrated intent to harm others, that law is in error and must be changed.''I could not agree more with this editorial. It is time to change this erroneous law, which jeopardizes students and teachers by forcing school officials to ignore early warning signs of disaster. Maintaining a safe learning environment requires that local school officials have the authority and flexibility to discipline all students in an equitable and effective manner, especially when it comes to weapons. Let's unshackle our teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards from a law that prevents them from keeping our children safe and secure. Let's give them the power to stop a tragedy before it happens.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:10:25.278158,2015-03-17 19:10:25.278158,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1999-05-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-05/html/CREC-1999-05-05-pt1-PgS4792-4.htm,64,31,145,S4792-S4808,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2558,MO,Blaine,Luetkemeyer,R,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise today in support of H.R. 3892, designating the United States Postal Service facility located at 101 West Highway 64 Bypass in Roper, North Carolina, the ``E.V. Wilkins Post Office.''Born in Roper, North Carolina, on July 4, 1911, Elmer Vanray Wilkins spent his childhood in Roper before attending North Carolina Central University, where he received a bachelor of science and master of arts degree. Upon graduation, Mr. Wilkins returned home to Roper, where he taught mathematics at J.J. Clemmons High School. During the time he was serving as a teacher, Mr. Wilkins met his wife, Elizabeth, also a fellow teacher.As a result of his success as a teacher, in 1941 he was promoted to principal of Clemmons High School, a position he held with distinction for over 30 years.Throughout his decades of service at Clemmons High School, Mr. Wilkins was described as a mentor to many of his students.In the 1950s, Mr. Wilkins began his involvement in politics. He worked with the NAACP to file a lawsuit that eventually ensured that African Americans in his home county of Washington County were allowed the right to vote. He continued his work in politics, and in 1967 he became the first post-Reconstruction African American member of the Roper town council.Mr. Wilkins broke down more racial barriers in 1975 when he became the first African American mayor of Roper. He served as mayor for 20 years until he retired. During his time as mayor, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention three separate times.His years of public service earned him many different awards and honors. His passion for helping others and dedication to the town of Roper was a model for young people in the community that he helped grow and change. He was given the North Carolina Distinguished Citizen Award, the Service Award by the North Carolina Leadership Caucus, the North Carolina Distinguished Service Award, and the North Carolina Human Rights Commission's Libby D. Koontz Award in recognition of his dedication and leadership in the areas of education, civil rights, and human rights.Elizabeth City State University dedicated its computer center to Mr. Wilkins and created an endowed faculty chair in his honor in its School of Education and Psychology.Mr. Wilkins' personal accomplishments are an inspiration to many in Roper and throughout North Carolina, including his daughter, Bunny Sanders, who is the current mayor of Roper.I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor E.V. Wilkins' life and successes. I ask my fellow Members to join me in supporting H.R. 3892.I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:10:25.437278,2015-03-17 19:10:25.437278,House,E.V.

2559,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,These are working folks. They are not--frankly, my family is very blessed. The tax cuts that were passed helped my family. It didn't help some of the families out there now struggling with unemployment.The rest of the stimulus that is out there--I have been interested in Missouri. In fact, I wrote a letter to the budget chairs in Missouri because they were kind of puffing up about how they were going to be able to balance the budget this year. I looked into it and realized that the only way they were balancing the budget this year was because of the stimulus money. It is, in fact, the stimulus money that has gone to Kentucky, gone to Illinois, gone to Missouri, gone to Oregon, gone to Alaska, and gone to Rhode Island. That is what is allowing these State legislatures to keep from making massive layoffs of public school teachers. There would be massive cuts in education in Missouri this year, and, frankly, no cuts in public education would be popular in Missouri.I asked the Missouri legislators. I said: Some of you have been talking about doing away with the stimulus, pulling back the stimulus. In fact, some of our friends across the aisle said we should get rid of the rest of the stimulus. I asked the State legislators: What will you cut if we pull the stimulus? Tell me how Missourians will be hurt if we decide to pull the rest of the stimulus and maybe spend it on other things, such as perhaps this emergency bill dealing with unemployment insurance. They would not tell me. They want the people of Missouri to think they are balancing that budget with fairy dust. They don't want the people of Missouri to know that, in fact, the stimulus is what is out there helping these States balance these budgets because their revenue has dropped off the charts, just like our revenue has, which is causing some of the deficit and which is certainly contributing in a great way to the debt as it relates to a drop in revenue, an increase in unemployment expenses, and then the programs that have been passed in the previous administration not paid for.I have 20,000 Missourians--20,000--who are going to find out sometime in the next 48 hours that they are done with unemployment. I cannot help but believe that if we have this kind of crisis at the other end of the income scale, that all of a sudden we would not have this newfound religion that this is the moment, this is the hour, this is the day that we are going to find new religion about deficits. It is the wrong time.I am a cosponsor of pay-go. I am a cosponsor of the fiscal commission. I don't take earmarks. I voted against the omnibus. I voted against many budget bills because I think there was too much fat in them. I voted against a lot of fiscal measures in this body. But this is not the time to do this on the backs of these families. It is the wrong time.,2015-03-17 19:10:25.609398,2015-03-17 19:10:25.609398,Senate,UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4691,2010-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-25/html/CREC-2010-02-25-pt1-PgS776.htm,25,151,156,S776-S792,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2560,MO,Todd,Akin,R,In expectation of this thing. So what you are saying is really not very outlandish, from a commonsense point of view. It is not like you are speculating and saying this thing is not going to work.We have seen European socialized medicine. We have next door the Canadian socialized medicine model. And I think it was about 10 years ago the head of Canada, their prime minister said, We have got the best health care system in the world, as long as you are healthy. It was that little ``as long as you are healthy'' piece that is the problem. If you are not healthy, you go down to America to get it taken care of. So we have seen it not work in Europe.I am a cancer survivor. I see what the cancer rate statistics are in England. I don't want to be a cancer guy in England. I wouldn't want to be a cancer guy here. So you see it hasn't worked in England, it hasn't worked in Canada, as well as our system currently works.Then, of course, we saw Massachusetts and Tennessee take bold forays into this socialized medicine field, and they got hammered by it. So what do we do? We do the same dumb thing.I was going to jump to something even more basic, though, if you think about it, and this was a statistic that kind of surprised me--some of them are in the Congressional Record--and that was the number of people that were killed by their own governments.If you take a look, you know, at the good old communists. You look at Stalin, he basically had murdered about 40 million people. Now, he was pretty good at murdering people, but not nearly as good as Chairman Mao in China, who has credit for killing about 60 million Chinese.Now, this is government-on-citizen crime. This was not a war. In fact, if you add just the people killed in various communist countries that killed their own population, the governments killing their own population, you have more people killed by just communism alone than all the wars in history since the time of Christ.So the question is, is it really rational for human beings to put so much trust in government? That is not talking about Nazis or the other types of dictators that killed lots of their own citizens.So why do we have this great faith in government, when we see it doesn't work for health care, yet we have the government in charge of that? We are putting government in charge of student loans and in charge of insurance for flooding, and we have got the Federal Government in charge of housing and in charge of education. We have got the Federal Government in charge of car companies, insurance companies and all.Let's see, the Soviet Union, what was their model? The government was in charge of, well, let's see, education, health care, your house, your food and your job. It didn't work for them. Why do we want to do the same thing here?,2015-03-17 19:10:25.731487,2015-03-17 19:10:25.731487,House,WHAT GOT US INTO THIS ECONOMIC MESS?,2010-05-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-05-05/html/CREC-2010-05-05-pt1-PgH3184.htm,66,15,156,H3184-H3188,A000358,mr. akin
2561,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 90th Anniversary of the Independence, Missouri Chamber of Commerce, located in my District. History reveals how Independence, the county seat, grew from a village, to a town, to the fourth largest city in Missouri. Civic leaders joined together to create a forum for the maintenance, growth and economic stability of the city. The Chamber has played a vital role in providing vision which helped to tackle the hard economic problems of the day. Today's Chamber is comprised of a ``. . . partnership of more than 1,200 business and professional people committed to making a difference in the community.''Following its founding in 1920, the Chamber constitution encouraged its members ``to promote the civic, economic, and social welfare of the people of Independence and vicinity'' with membership open to all interested people. Colonel William Southern, Jr., who began publishing the Jackson Examiner in 1898, served on the original Board of Directors and holds the honor of being the first Board President of the Chamber. Due to the continued quality of leadership, the Chamber's involvement is respected on every issue from legislative initiatives to promoting pride in the city.Throughout its 90 year history, the Chamber has initiated and supported local programs for economic development, public education, and general community quality of life. Working as a cohesive body with its Board, staff and members, the Chamber strives to provide a better quality of life for its citizens. Historically, they have campaigned to improve infrastructure, stimulate economic growth, annexation, transportation, parks, education and tourism. Through a variety of methods, they have achieved their objectives through bonds, fundraisers or by launching programs to benefit the citizens of Independence. ``Put Us to Work'' was one program initiated during the depression to coordinate all civic relief efforts and employment assistance for its citizens. We should recognize organizations like the Chamber of Independence as they help our communities find solutions to our current economic challenges.When Harry S. Truman came home from serving in World War I, he came home to Independence, Missouri. When he was contemplating a run for Eastern District Judge, he went to Col. Southern for support. After serving as President, he once again returned to Independence. The Chamber honored him as a lifetime member of the Independence Chamber in 1945. Later, out of respect and admiration, the Chamber proudly supported fundraising efforts for the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library.Madam Speaker, please join me in extending my warmest congratulations to Dr. Patty Schumacher, Chair of the Board, and Rick Hemmingsen, Chamber President, for the many accomplishments of the Independence Chamber of Commerce on this, their 90th Anniversary. The Chamber's work and dedication on behalf of the City of Independence has truly bettered our community.

Mr. Purdy dedicated his life to removing financial barriers to higher education and the awards and scholarships that are named after him are a testament to his hard work and dedication to this purpose.Mr. Purdy's passion for financial aid and serving students was sparked by his extraordinary life experiences. He graduated from high school without a nickel in 1932--the middle of the Great Depression. He managed to attend college through the National Youth Administration, a newly created national work program for students. Although he only earned $15 a month at 25 cents an hour through the program, it was enough to attend the College of Agriculture at the University of Missouri, where he ultimately earned a graduate degree.After graduating, Allan taught at Rutgers University and then joined the U.S. Navy where he served as a PT boat captain during World War II. After the war, he returned to the University of Missouri, MU, to work as an extension horticulturist--driving across the State to help farmers resolve problems with their fruit and vegetable crops. As he toured the State, he met many qualified students who lacked the financial resources to attend college. He advocated grant and work aid for these students to allow them to attend college. Allan was so diligent at recruiting these students that he was promoted to assistant to the dean of the College of Agriculture. In this position, he recruited students, arranged scholarships and part-time jobs for students, and helped graduates find jobs.At this time, catching the attention of the MU president, Allan was asked to start a department in the President's Office to coordinate all scholarships, jobs, and loans for all students on campus. Under the direction of the MU president, Allan began meeting with other aid administrators in the Midwest, which led to the formation of the Midwest Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators in 1962. The group eventually grew to become NASFAA in 1969 and was incorporated in 1973 as a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia and emphasized, above all else, the needs of students.Shortly after Allan's retirement in 1979, as then-Governor of Missouri, it was my pleasure to appoint him to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, MOHELA, in 1981 where he served more than 20 years. During that time he worked to implement borrower benefit programs including loan forgiveness and low interest rates. The Purdy Scholarship Fund to benefit students demonstrating the greatest financial need was also established to honor his legacy.At the 2006 NASFAA National Conference in Seattle, Mr. Purdy told his financial aid colleagues, ``It has been a wonderful 40 years of service to students.''``It is, I'm sure, a wonderful experience to each of you when you see students that have long-since graduated and now are gray-haired, and they thank you for what you have done for them over the years,'' Allan added. ``That is your overtime pay. Certainly we are not in the highest paid profession, but I think that we have the highest rewards for the work that we have done.''Allan is survived by his wife Vivian and their four children, Robert, George, Ray and Christina, and their families.It is my distinct honor to remember Allan Purdy's life today. His legacy of opening the doors of college to Missourians will be remembered by the countless lives he touched. ,2015-03-17 19:10:26.098742,2015-03-17 19:10:26.098742,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2010-11-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-11-19/html/CREC-2010-11-19-pt1-PgS8122.htm,152,0,156,S8122,B000611,mr. bond
2563,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, once again I stand as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 6400. This legislation would name the U.S. post office facility at 111 North 6th Street in St. Louis, Missouri, after a man who transformed his community while giving hope and opportunity to hundreds of young people, a true giant of philanthropy, the late Earl Wilson, Jr.The measure before us was first introduced on November 15, 2010. I am proud to say that the bill now enjoys the support and cosponsorship of 18 Members of Congress, including the entire congressional delegation from my home State of Missouri.Madam Speaker, Earl Wilson, Jr.'s lifetime of achievement in the corporate world, as the founder of the St. Louis Gateway Classic Foundation, as a proud veteran in the U.S. Army, as a father, husband, and friend to so many will live forever.Earl Wilson, Jr., was born in St. Louis on October 9, 1932. He grew up on 11th Street, just a few blocks away from the U.S. Post Office that will hopefully bear his name. Mr. Wilson graduated from Vashon High School and received his B.S. in education from Lincoln University in 1957. After graduation, he proudly served as a captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.In 1963, he became a corporate trailblazer at IBM, where he was a stellar performer for three decades. Toward the end of his IBM career, Mr. Wilson was loaned to his alma mater to help rescue his school from financial straits, which he successfully accomplished.Earl Wilson, Jr., later founded the St. Louis Gateway Classic Foundation, an annual football contest that helped to fund the dreams of deserving students. Without a doubt, his impact on the lives of so many young St. Louisans will endure for generations to come.Over the last 16 years, the annual Gridiron Classic featured top Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The game itself was a celebration of football tradition and a battle of the bands. But as Earl Wilson often reminded us, ``It was more than just a game.'' The St. Louis Gateway Classic Foundation effectively raised $2.6 million to send average C-grade students to college on full 4-year scholarships.The foundation's busy year-round schedule of fundraising and community events helped to fuel its success. To raise money, Wilson orchestrated golf tournaments, basketball shoot-outs, baseball games, a boxing showcase, pageants, and concerts. To give back to the community, the foundation provided quality after-school programs, an adult day care, holiday meals for people in need, and neighborhood lunches. He also created a Walk of Fame that honors local African Americans who have been pioneers in St. Louis.When Earl Wilson, Jr., passed away on October 29 of this year, it was not only an enormous personal loss for my family and me, but his death was mourned throughout St. Louis and across our Nation.Madam Speaker, I have been blessed to experience and witness firsthand his commitment to opening the doors of higher education to young people. He selflessly invested his immense talents and boundless energy to build up his community and his country. And as we move to recognize the accomplishments of this great humanitarian, father, and friend to many, I ask that we pass the underlying bill without reservation and pay tribute to a great American, Earl Wilson, Jr.I urge passage of H.R. 6400, and I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:10:26.342921,2015-03-17 19:10:26.342921,House,EARL WILSON, JR.

2564,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, each May, I hold a small business procurement conference at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Missouri. Through the years, many individuals have contributed to the success of this event, which helps entrepreneurs and small business owners to cut through bureaucratic red tape associated with the procurement process and to make business connections.One individual who was particularly helpful in gluing together my annual conference was Wes Savage, a good friend and expert in entrepreneurial studies and business development. Wes passed away rather unexpectedly last July, so the 2009 conference will be the first one without him.As I prepare for this year's event, let me take a moment to reflect on the life of a truly outstanding figure at the University of Central Missouri, a good family man, and a friend to so many people.Wes was born on May 25, 1937, in Decatur, Illinois. He received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering & industrial engineering from the University of Missouri--Rolla and a master's degree in production management & human resource management from Butler University. He also completed continuing education courses in psychology, banking, and basic programming.Wes enjoyed working and became an expert while being employed in a wide range of industries and organizations. He was a Registered Professional Engineer in the state of Missouri and gave time to the Engineers Club of Kansas City. He was affiliated with the Missouri Board of Architects, the Engineers and Land Surveyors, and the National Development Council.In 1987, Wes began working at the University of Central Missouri as the Consulting Engineer for the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and became coordinator for the SBDC in 1990. Wes served as the Center's director until he became Director of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies and Development at the University.In his role at the University, Wes assisted and advised numerous Missouri business owners and entrepreneurs. He gave sound advice to help Missourians begin or improve business operations, which in turn, helped to create jobs and boost economic productivity in the Show-Me State. I have heard from many individuals through the years who have expressed gratitude for working with the SBDC because of the Center's positive impact on business.Wes also cared deeply about teaching university students about entrepreneurship and the unique opportunities and business tools available to people in this country. This is why he was particularly thrilled when the University created the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies and Development and why he helped create an online course and co-taught with staff the first entrepreneurial course at the University.Wes Savage applied the things he learned in education and in life to his professional career. He was an experienced manager who motivated those around him with his strong work ethic and his relaxed, friendly demeanor.I know Members of the House will join me in expressing gratitude for Wes's life and for extending best wishes to his wife, Jane; his sons and their wives, Craig and Deana Savage, Scott and Gina Savage, and Grant and Erika Savage; his six grandchildren; and all of his friends and colleagues. ,2015-03-17 19:10:26.490026,2015-03-17 19:10:26.490026,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO WESLEY SAVAGE,2009-05-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-05-18/html/CREC-2009-05-18-pt1-PgE1183-4.htm,76,0,155,E1183-E1184,S000465,mr. skelton
2565,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Marian Lonning, a special woman who has devoted her time, talents, and life to individuals with developmental disabilities. Mrs. Lonning, a proud parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent, will soon be recognized by Community Living for her tireless efforts to improve services for people with disabilities. I want to associate myself with the recognition provided by Community Living.Community Living, a not-for-profit agency in St. Charles County providing life-enriching services for people with disabilities, will present the award to Mrs. Lonning on October 18, 2008, at the organization's annual Legacy Ball. The Legacy Award is presented to an individual whose outstanding service to people with disabilities and the community as a whole leaves a lasting legacy for generations to come.Before coming to Missouri, Mrs. Lonning worked with people with developmental disabilities as a nurse and teacher. She and her husband, James, moved to St. Charles County in July 1968 from Kalamazoo, MI, and we are lucky to have her.In February 1969, Mrs. Lonning opened a Day Activity Center for children with developmental disabilities in the basement of Boonslick Christian Church in St. Charles. She had been approached by Jane Crider about starting a day program for children with severe developmental disabilities who were unable to pass the test for Boonslick State School. With the help of an assistant, Mrs. Lonning ran the center 3 days per week, serving 8 to 10 children.In 1974, the Day Activity Center transitioned to providing services for adults after Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 passed and children at the center were able to go to school. Additionally, Mrs. Lonning started the Day Activity Center Auxiliary, a support group for the parents of the center's participants, which still exists today.Mrs. Lonning served on the Senate Bill 40 Committee to help approve a countrywide property tax to provide and fund services for people with development disabilities. In 1977, the committee's efforts proved successful when the tax passed. Because of the Senate Bill 40's passage, the Day Activity Center was able to expand and was later taken under the wings of Community Living, Inc., when it was incorporated in The center eventually began providing service 5 days per week and hired more staff, including special education teachers. In 1980, a second center was opened in O'Fallon.Mrs. Lonning served as Director of the Day Activity Centers, now known as Support Services for Adults (SSA), until her retirement in In her retirement, Mrs. Lonning has remained active in championing those with disabilities, serving for 3 years on the Handicapped Facilities Board, now the Developmental Disabilities Resource Board, the entity that was created as a result of the Senate Bill 40 tax. She also served for three terms on Community Living's Board of Directors, serving as president, vice president, secretary, and as an executive committee member.Today I want to shine a spotlight on not only Mrs. Lonning's great and many achievements, but also on the vital role that we all play in ensuring that all children and particularly those with disabilities receive the best education possible.Mrs. Lonning believes firmly in providing quality services to people with disabilities throughout their lives, and today her vision has become a reality. Mrs. Lonning has said that she has always felt that God put her where he needed her to be. Furthermore, the motto from her alma mater, Pine Rest Nursing School, has guided her work throughout the years: ``It's only one life, it will soon be passed, only what's done for Christ will last.''For these reasons, I am privileged to stand before this body and congratulate Mrs. Lonning on her receipt of this prestigious award.,2015-03-17 19:10:26.691162,2015-03-17 19:10:26.691162,Extensions,HONORING MARIAN LONNING,2008-09-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-09-29/html/CREC-2008-09-29-pt1-PgE2158.htm,157,0,154,E2158,H000948,mr. hulshof
2566,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring Rev. Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, a much-loved member of the Kansas City community. Reverend Hartsfield will soon retire after 40 years as the senior pastor of Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church. He has served as Metropolitan's pastor since 1972 with the support of his wife Matilda and their four children. Prior to that, he held pastoral positions in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Kansas.Reverend Hartsfield's distinguished career in the ministry has touched thousands in Missouri. As the ambassador for his church, he has graced pulpits across the country bringing words of hope to the masses. He is a respected servant-leader of many organizations including the National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.; National Baptist Convention, USA; Congress of National Black Churches and the General Baptist State Convention of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska.He has expanded his ministry as a community advocate. Reverend Hartsfield has spent much of his life speaking up for those whose voices are ignored on the subjects of civil rights, health care, education, crime and safety, and economic development. One of his bravest acts occurred in 1964 when five department stores in downtown Kansas City refused to allow African Americans to try on clothes, use the restrooms, drink at the water fountains, or eat at the lunch counters. Reverend Hartsfield organized a boycott and marched on the stores. Eventually African Americans were allowed to patronize these stores but it was not without the personal intervention of this inspirational leader.His service has afforded him a seat at many tables where he has proven to be a skillful diplomat and a cunning negotiator. Reverend Hartsfield has worked on countless boards including those of the Jazz District Redevelopment Corporation, Greater Kansas City Community Foundation, Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission, and Kansas City Interfaith Council.Reverend Hartsfield has a bachelor's degree in elementary education and minor degrees in religion and psychology from Clark College in Atlanta, GA. He also holds a bachelor and master of divinity from Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta. Dr. Hartsfield has served as an adjunct professor and guest lecturer at numerous colleges and universities across the Nation.Reverend Hartsfield has been a mentor to many, from pastors to politicians. He continues to provide wise counsel to those who want to make a difference in the world. He also has the ability to identify hidden treasures in those who have not been afforded an opportunity to thrive. This precious gift has been the catalyst for many to realize their dreams.For 40 years, the members of Metropolitan have been blessed to have this powerful leader at the helm. Reverend Hartsfield has worked hard and he has earned the opportunity to step back. However, we know his work is not yet done. He will continue shaping lives, communities and destinies for years to come.During one of the many times he was honored for his good works it was said:Wallace Hartsfield does battle with all the dark forces that would keep us from knowing and loving one another. With his Bible and his passion for justice and his rock-ribbed integrity, Reverend Wallace Hartsfield leads us to the high moral ground where all God's children sit down together as family at the table of peace and delight.No truer words could be spoken. ,2015-03-17 19:10:26.832291,2015-03-17 19:10:26.832291,Senate,IN HONOR OF REVEREND WALLACE S.

2567,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Lea Ann Pitcher as being named one of the most `Outstanding Mathematics Teachers in the United States' by The Presidential Award for Excellence. This award was established in 1983 by an Act of Congress and is administered for the White House by the National Science Foundation. Offered every other year to high school teachers, only two teachers per state are bestowed this great honor. Recognizing only the most exceptional teachers from across the United States, this awards' program is designed to honor teachers for their ingenious contributions to the classroom and to their profession. Mrs. Pitcher personifies excellence both in the classroom and as a professional. ``Awardees serve as an example for their colleagues, inspiration to their communities, and leaders in the quality of mathematics and science.'' As a high school math teacher, Mr. Pitcher does just that.Mrs. Pitcher's work at Lee's Summit Senior High School is exemplary. She educates our children in one of the areas we need strengthening the most--mathematics. After a decade as a pharmacist, she left to pursue teaching. Her students respect and rely on her knowledge; her peers emulate her dedication and teaching practices of using debate and discussion in math; and I know that Principal Faulkenberry considers her to be one of the school's greatest assets. She has truly touched our community and changed the lives of students in Lee's Summit throughout her 11 years as an educator. As a longtime resident, she has shown her dedication to our community, her students, and education throughout her long career as a teacher in the Greater Kansas City Area, having worked at both Hickman Mills High School and Lee's Summit High School.Mr. Speaker, please join me today, May 9, 2006, on National Teacher Day, in thanking Mrs. Lea Ann Pitcher for her unyielding commitment to education, but more importantly, thank her for her significant contributions to the students of Lee's Summit Senior High School in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District. This year's theme of National Teacher Day is ``Great Teachers Make Great Public Schools'' and is a fitting description of Mrs. Pitcher's contribution to our society. Rarely do people touch the lives of students and communities in a way that will follow them forever. I want to thank her again for her outstanding work and her extraordinary commitment to the Lee's Summit students. As one former recipient of the Presidential Award exclaimed, ``I think of this as the Nobel Prize of my profession.'' Mrs. Pitcher has truly attained the highest honor in her field. This accolade is something to celebrate because it recognizes someone to emulate. I urge my colleagues of the 109th Congress to please join me in congratulating Mrs. Lea Ann Pitcher on her well-deserved recognition.,2015-03-17 19:10:26.978371,2015-03-17 19:10:26.978371,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF MRS.

2568,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, June 27, 2006 marks the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the Sisters of Mercy in St. Louis, MO. Founded in Dublin, Ireland, in 1831 by Mother Catherine McAuley, the Sisters have dedicated themselves to serving the sick, poor, and uneducated, particularly women and children.In 1856, at the request of St. Louis Archbishop Peter J. Kenrick, six Sisters of Mercy journeyed by train and boat from New York to St. Louis, arriving on June 27, 1856, to open St. Francis Xavier Parish School. During their first year in St. Louis, in addition to opening this new school, the Sisters visited the sick, poor, and jailed; started a Sunday school program for African-American women and girls; began an industrial school for children with one parent; and opened an orphanage. Despite many challenges including lack of money, food and clothing, the Sisters persevered with determination and faith. They expanded their ministry during the Civil War, visiting war prisoners at the hospital and jail.Growing enrollment at St. Francis Xavier School necessitated the opening of a new school in 1871. The Sisters of Mercy have continued the focus on education in St. Louis. Over the past 150 years since their arrival in St. Louis, more than 177 Sisters of Mercy have served in more than 20 parish elementary schools and 5 high schools in Missouri. These schools include Christ the King School in University City, Mercy High School in University City, St. Joan of Arc School in South St. Louis, Annunciation School in Webster Groves, and Mercy Junior College in Webster Groves.Recognizing the ever-growing health care needs of the community, in 1871 the Sisters converted the old St. Francis Xavier School to an infirmary. The hospital struggled financially because many patients were unable to pay, but the Sisters never turned patients away due to lack of funds. Instead, Sisters even sacrificed their mattresses and bedding to accommodate patients. To meet the increased need for their health care services, the Sisters moved the hospital to two other St. Louis sites before relocating to its current location on South New Ballas Road in 1963.While better known for their work in education and health care, the Sisters have served the people of the St. Louis metropolitan area in numerous other ministries including working with immigrants, providing spiritual direction, hosting groups at their conference and retreat center, and serving the poor. Since their 1856 arrival, the Sisters of Mercy have continuously served the residents of St. Louis and its surrounding areas. They overcame many obstacles to carry on their services and today we recognize their dedication with our deepest gratitude and respect. It truly has been a Journey of Service.Cities/municipalities in St. Louis where Sisters of Mercy have served/lived and currently serve/live: Creve Coeur, Frontenac University City, Chesterfield, City of St. Louis, Webster Groves, and Washington, MO. ,2015-03-17 19:10:27.110489,2015-03-17 19:10:27.110489,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2006-06-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-06-05/html/CREC-2006-06-05-pt1-PgS5425-2.htm,69,0,152,S5425-S5426,B000611,mr. bond
2569,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Marlys Smith, a teacher at Matthews Elementary School in Sikeston, Missouri. Marlys is retiring after 31 years of service in Missouri's Public Schools.Marlys was born on November 18th, 1952, on the Marine Base at Quantico, Virginia, to Monda and Jim Davis. The oldest of six children, she spent her early years in Mississippi County, Missouri, and graduated from East Prairie High School. She went on to receive her undergraduate degree in Elementary Education from Southeast Missouri State University in 1975. Later, she obtained her Masters Degree from William Woods University in Fulton, Missouri.As a young girl of 10, Marlys contracted a disabling bone disease that caused her to be hospitalized for nearly three months. Because of the radical surgery she needed, she lost the ability to use her right hip, until extensive corrective surgery in the last year. Rather than allow this physical impairment to hinder her in any way, she turned her energy from outdoor activities to music. The young girl from Mississippi County who became a teacher and taught everything from high school special education to first, third and sixth grades also had time to develop her voice. She sang with ``Young Americans in Concert'' in New York at Carnegie Hall, in Europe, and also for President Nixon in the White House in the summer of 1971. And then in 1993, my late husband, Congressman Bill Emerson, invited this beautiful, young lady to sing ``Amazing Grace'' to 4000 participants at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington DC. She again shared her voice in a rendition of ``Amazing Grace'' in 1996 at Bill's funeral in Missouri and in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol.Marlys Smith, the school teacher, has been a Girl Scout Leader, Sunday School teacher and a mentor to thousands of girls and boys in Southern Missouri and a friend to all who have known her. And I count myself as one of those friends. Marlys and her husband, Lloyd, who is my Chief of Staff, are family. We have shared many wonderful and tearful times over the last 25 years.Although Marlys has been a leader in her field and a dedicated volunteer in a host of groups, her most special role has been that of a wife to Lloyd and mother to their three children, Trista, Sam and Tiffany. A working mom who, because of her husband's travels, was many times the only one at home to go to scouts, ball games and church events or to help with homework. She never complained and always has a smile on her face. Indeed the young girl who nearly died at age 10 turned into a beautiful woman who has shown a zest for life and shared her love with all those who have known her.I congratulate Marlys on her retirement and wish her the best in all of her future endeavors. From the Emerson Family to Marlys Smith, we say thank you, and we pray you continue to spread your wonderful gifts for years and years to come.,2015-03-17 19:10:27.353638,2015-03-17 19:10:27.353638,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO MRS.

2570,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk about the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act that I hope we see on the floor during this Congress. Mr. Garrett from New Jersey and Mr. Bishop from Utah and other members of the Congressional Constitution Caucus are also speaking on behalf of this important legislation tonight. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), who is the lead cosponsor of this legislation along with me.I am pleased to be the sponsor of the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act. I would like to start by explaining what it is not about. This bill is not about reining in an activist judiciary or about ending consent decrees. This legislation is about increasing the responsibility and accountability of elected officials. This is really focused on what elected officials are elected to do.Consent decrees are too often used by elected officials as an excuse not to solve the problems they have been elected to solve. The principal goal of this legislation is to return the responsibility for public policy-making and the governing of public institutions to elected officials. When a consent decree lasts for decades, as many of them do, many elected officials never have the opportunity to take responsibility for important public services. A politician can say, I would really like to do something about the transportation system in Los Angeles County, for example, but I cannot because of that consent decree. Or I would like to spend more on education in this State, but I really cannot because our budget is determined by these consent decrees on other issues or even on education itself. And their successors in that office can and often do say the same thing.Consent decrees, in my view, have become a hiding place for public officials, relieving them of responsibility in the area that the consent decree affects. So let me again repeat, this is a bill, an act, that would really make public officials take responsibility for the things they have been elected to do.This bill would create an obligation on the part of newly elected public officials that they would have an opportunity to look at every consent decree that their predecessors were part of and defend why the consent decree should continue or go to the courts and explain why the consent decree no longer applies. If the plaintiff can explain to the judge why it is important that the consent decree continue, then the decree stays in place.Our goal is to return public responsibility to public officials. Too many people in the country today, too many public officials who even try to take on these issues find that the consent decrees that were entered into decades before by their predecessors prevent them from doing the hard things that need to be done.The only consent decrees that could be dissolved under this action are those in which the plaintiff is incapable of proving a continued need for court supervision.

After 14 years of service, on June 5, 2005, Rev. Thompson retired from his pastoral helm at Mason Memorial United Methodist Church, which is the cause of recognition and celebration of the dedication that he exudes in all aspects of service to the Kansas City community.Rev. Thompson's reputation as a community leader extends beyond the local or national level, but is inclusive of the international community. He was one of 22 U.S. ministers that traveled to South Africa on a fact finding educational exchange, at the request of Bishop Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela, and the South African Council of Churches. ``Fuzzy,'' as he is affectionately known, was one of three U.S. ministers to conduct Easter services for U.S. hostages held in Tehran, Iran in 1980. He was also one of 17 U.S. ministers and activists who served as official observers for the first election ever held in South Africa that allowed the right to vote to all races. He said it was a humbling experience seeing people lining up the night before and standing in line for blocks in order to exercise their right to vote for the first time.Since 1984, Rev. Thompson has been a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. He served as Regional Coordinator of Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984 Presidential campaign and as the Missouri State Coordinator of the Jackson Campaign in 1988. ``Fuzzy'' is currently President of the Kansas City Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.He has served on the boards of Freedom Incorporated as Chairman of the Nominating Committee, Black Adoption Program and Services, Human Rights Commission of Kansas City, Missouri, and Northwest Political Faction. He has been involved in helping to solve the problems of young adults, especially in the areas of education and unemployment. He held the position of Executive Director of the Martin Luther King Urban Center for 30 years.Rev. Thompson graduated from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri with a Bachelor of Science in Education, and received a Master of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry at St. Paul School of Theology. He has been married 39 years to Cheryl (Love) Thompson. His mother, Marvia Thompson, was a founding member of the St. James United Methodist which I pastor. In 2003, we joined Rev. Thompson to celebrate and mourn her death and life. He baptized my youngest son, Evan, and he has been a friend and a confidant to me for more than 30 years.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to the Rev. Nelson ``Fuzzy'' Thompson for his relentless efforts in extending service not only within the areas surrounding Kansas City, Missouri and the United States, but for his contributions to the global community. I urge my colleagues to please join me in congratulating ``Fuzzy'' on his retirement as Pastor of Mason Memorial United Methodist Church, for we know that he has not retired from the ministry nor from the community, because God's work is never done.,2015-03-17 19:10:27.587806,2015-03-17 19:10:27.587806,Extensions,PAYING TRIBUTE TO REV.

2572,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that Dr. Helen Washburn will retire as President of Cottey College in Nevada, Missouri. Cottey College is a two-year, independent women's college that for the past 18 years has benefitted from the fine leadership of Dr. Washburn.In her time at Cottey College, Dr. Washburn has been the most valuable of leaders. Seeing needs, she worked to address them and make the experience at Cottey of the highest quality. As an example, Dr. Washburn was instrumental in combating a trend that she observed of young women losing interest in math and sciences at a young age. In response, she created a summer science camp held on the Cottey campus. This camp was exclusively for young women. In addition, Dr. Washburn's long-range planning efforts resulted in an Associate of Science degree to compliment the Associate of Arts already offered.Dr. Washburn's efforts to aid in the education of young women can be seen in other aspects of Cottey College. She led the campaign to construct the Rubie Burton Academic Center, a state-of-the-art academic facility that helps students keep up with the latest technology. The Center for Women's Leadership aids young women in becoming tomorrow's leaders. Most recently, under Dr. Washburn's leadership, Cottey College received ten-year continued accreditation with The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.In recognition of the many accomplishments realized during her time as President of Cottey College, Dr. Washburn has been the recipient of many awards. For her efforts in creating an international community on campus, the French government named her an Officer in the National Order of Merit. In 2003, she was named Chief Executive Officer of the Year for District VI of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education. In addition, the University of Idaho, from which she earned her bachelor's and master's degrees, presented her with the prestigious Silver and Gold award, an honor based on career achievement, and the University of Idaho Alumni Association inducted Dr. Washburn into its Hall of Fame.There can be no greater testament to an educator than the accomplishments of her students. The many women who have passed through the halls of Cottey College under the leadership and direction of Dr. Washburn have proven to be a worthy and lasting legacy. And though Dr. Washburn will soon be leaving the Cottey campus, many more women in the years to come will benefit from her outstanding work during her 18 years as its President.Mr. Speaker, I am sure the Members of the House will join me in honoring Dr. Helen Washburn for her years of service and in wishing her all the best in the days ahead.,2015-03-17 19:10:27.698885,2015-03-17 19:10:27.698885,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DR.

2573,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, the Mingo Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center was established in 1965 and is located on the southeastern corner of Mingo National Wildlife Refuge. Over 224 corps members participate in the program at Mingo at any one time. They can see daily what many people travel miles to observe on a National Wildlife Refuge. They are working to make a special effort to provide vocational work sites for training, as well as placement in permanent jobs, not just at Mingo, but on other facilities within the region.In a residential setting, students are given the opportunity to complete their secondary education, round out their social skills, and acquire a vocational skill. Vocational training is offered in the following trades at Mingo: automotive repair, building maintenance, bricklaying, carpentry, heavy equipment operation, painting, welding, clerical, culinary arts, and health services.With an audience of over 200 young people in residence for over a year on a National Wildlife Refuge, the Center is taking advantage of the opportunity to expose them to environmental awareness concepts in the education, vocational training, and residential living programs. The Center is a unique mix of human resources and natural resource management.The Mingo Job Corps Center, located in Puxico, Missouri, has become a critical part of the economy in Southeast Missouri. I first want to brag on the work the Center has done and give a little background on the work they do to better the community and the lives of those they serve. The Center has been crucial in providing the young people in Southeast Missouri many opportunities that they would not otherwise have available to them. The lack of viable economic opportunities in the area is staggering, and, as a result, many people in the area have to rely on government assistance to make ends meet.The Mingo Job Corps Center is the one place these people can go to develop the critical skills needed to enter the workforce. While some of the students at the Center are what we commonly refer to as being ``at-risk,'' the Job Corps program has allowed these young men and women to make a life for themselves and succeed. Additionally, the surrounding community has benefitted from the work of the Center because, upon graduation, the students are able to give back to the community with the skills they have learned.Last year, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that they did not have the budget to adequately operate the Center. As a result, the Department of Labor recommended that the operations of the Center be contracted out. I completely opposed the proposal to contract out the operations at the Mingo Job Corps Center.In response to the announcement to contract out operations Senator Bond and I introduced legislation to transfer the Mingo Center to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. By adding the Mingo Job Corps Center to the list of U.S. Forest Service-run facilities, we will protect the livelihood of the students and employees served by the Center and ensure that the facility will continue to be operated by an experienced and dedicated staff. Most importantly, the skilled workers who graduate from the Center will continue to add to the dedicated workforce and contribute to the health of the rural economy.I am very proud to bring this legislation to the House of Representatives for a vote today, because it represents an important initiative in rural Missouri. Our job training programs are vital to our economic success now and in the future. Keeping the Mingo Center open and operating is a small, but important way to acknowledge our commitment to a dedicated workforce.,2015-03-17 19:10:27.843989,2015-03-17 19:10:27.843989,Extensions,MINGO JOB CORPS CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CENTER,2004-10-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-10-04/html/CREC-2004-10-04-pt1-PgE1795-2.htm,123,0,150,E1795,E000172,mrs. emerson
2574,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend our troops on the battlefields in Iraq. Their continuing advance to victory is a product of that courage and ingenuity under changing conditions. It is also the results of extraordinarily detailed and adaptive planning. That itself was built on the knowledge and wisdom instilled by our war colleges.These institutions in every service make great officers into outstanding war-time leaders. Military historians have noted that the allied victory in World War II is due in no small part to the fact that some of our top military leaders both attended and taught at the services war colleges. I believe the same will be said for Operation Iraqi Freedom. In all of the services, including the Army's exceptional war college at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, our officers are skilled in the art of strategy, operations, and tactics that are the foundation of an innovative and effective military campaign.The instruction provided by our service intermediate- and senior-level war colleges came to fruition in the war plan developed by General Tommy Franks and his team. The plan outlined a truly joint effort that has kept American forces a constant 48 to 72 hours ahead of Iraqi responses. The strategy has hit hard at Iraqi leadership and Republican Guard targets, degrading command and control and isolating the bands of fighters unwise enough to take on our troops. Quite simply, the Iraqi military is already incapable of fighting in a coordinated way at division, brigade, and battalion levels. This is a stunning military achievement that would not have been possible without leaders educated in the art of war. And we as a Nation owe a debt to the professional military education system that provided that education to today's senior military leaders.The current American infiltration of Baghdad demonstrates our disciplined ability to encircle the city and deal with the remnants of resistance, sector by sector. The strategy also shows a sophisticated approach to enhancing the psychological impact of each military action taken. By removing the will of the Iraqis to fight, our victory and the Iraqi people's liberation will come that much more quickly. I believe that military historians and strategists will long study the plans of this operation, the planning that was a product of the American war college system will become the lesson plan for future officers.As British Air Marshal Brian Burridge said this morning, the U.S. advance into Bagdad has been unique. Historians and academics will pour over it for years, and this will be a required case study for students of war.We should be proud of our troops and of the officers who lead them. But we should also feel deep pride for the system of institutions that has made this leadership as exceptional as it is.,2015-03-17 19:10:27.988091,2015-03-17 19:10:27.988091,House,AMERICA'S IMPORTANT WAR COLLEGES,2003-04-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-07/html/CREC-2003-04-07-pt1-PgH2839.htm,55,1,149,H2839,S000465,mr. skelton
2575,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.I rise in support of the Norton amendment, and I strongly oppose private school vouchers. No matter the location, the type of program or the amount, vouchers are a bad idea for our children. The Committee on Government Reform approved this amendment by a one-vote, razor-thin margin. Both Republicans and Democrats voted against the D.C. voucher, and I thank my colleagues for their opposition to D.C. vouchers.Serious concerns were raised about this amendment during committee consideration. I share those concerns and believe it is important that this information be shared with the public.We know that vouchers drain millions from public education. Any extra money should be invested into D.C. public schools and other public schools nationwide that deserve the majority of our children. Investing in public schools helps us hire more highly-qualified teachers, purchase supplies and books, and repair our schools. Vouchers are not the solution.Vouchers eliminate public oversight for taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, as illustrated in Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Florida's voucher programs, vouchers eliminate public oversight, public accountability and have led to cases of fraud and fiscal mismanagement.Vouchers contradict the accountability reform required by the No Child Left Behind, such as the hiring of highly-qualified teachers and the annual testing and public reporting on student performance. These standards are not required by private schools that accept federally funded vouchers, creating a double standard regarding Federal funding and education.I would be glad to hear from proponents of vouchers to tell us why we should not have accountability when public dollars follow these children to private institutions. I would love to hear from the other side to tell us why we should not have better accountability.I offered an amendment in the Committee on Government Reform in good faith, asking that the same standards that apply to all of our public schools also apply to these vouchers. I would love to hear their response.I urge my colleagues to respect the right of D.C. residents to make decisions of their own in their city. The majority of D.C. elected officials and residents oppose vouchers. The official position of the D.C. school board and city council is to oppose vouchers. If the residents of the District of Columbia wanted vouchers in D.C., their local governance, the school board or city council could create such a program.Some in this body have suggested that D.C. residents need our permission or Federal money to create a voucher program. That simply is not true. D.C. residents do not need the permission of this Congress. Nor do they need the Federal purse to create a program. D.C. residents just do not want vouchers.,2015-03-17 19:10:28.121185,2015-03-17 19:10:28.121185,House,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004,2003-09-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-09-05/html/CREC-2003-09-05-pt1-PgH7955-2.htm,121,60,149,H7955-H7993,C001049,mr. clay
2576,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, October 6-12, 2002 is National Osteopathic Medicine, NOM, Week, a week when the nation's 49,000 osteopathic physicians, D.O.s are focused on increasing the public's awareness of access to care issues for patients across the nation.For almost 25 years now, the American Osteopathic Association, AOA, and its members have celebrated the osteopathic medical community's unified effort to educate the nation about issues influencing the American health care system. I am especially pleased the theme of this year's NOM Week is ``Access to Care.''When osteopathic physicians, medical students, interns, residents and supporters of osteopathic medicine travel to Las Vegas, NV to attend the AOA's 107th Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar, nearly 8,000 will receive the latest information on issues impacting patients access to care quality and timely health care. The program covers such topics as professional liability insurance reform, rural health, the uninsured, SCHIP and other access to care programs for children, bioterrorism and mental health. I applaud the osteopathic medical community for emphasizing patient access issues, so important to my home state of Missouri and the nation.Take for example, rural health. Many citizens of my home state face limited availability of health care services in their communities. Access to health care can be established only when medical professionals are available to provide quality health care. We must do more to ensure that all Americans have access to timely health care and part of the solution is to place physicians in rural communities. Let's not forget the access to care barriers facing minority populations, children and the elderly.Over the past few years, medical liability premiums have escalated out of control causing health care quality, access, and cost problems. While some states have passed professional liability insurance (PLI) system reforms, not every state has effective laws in place. The osteopathic medical community recognizes many states face critical PLI system problems.For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives and health of my fellow citizens in Missouri. I am proud to say that the birth of this profession took place in Northwest Missouri. Overall, more than 100 million patient visits are made each year to osteopathic physicians. D.O.s are committed to serving the needs of rural and underserved communities and make up 15 percent of the total physician population in towns of 10,000 or less.Similar to requirements set for M.D.s, D.O.s must successfully complete four years of medical education at one of the nation's 20 osteopathic medical schools; a one-year internship; and a multi-year residency program. Throughout this education, D.O.s are trained to understand how the musculoskeletal system influences the condition of all other body systems. Many patients want this extra knowledge a part of their health care. Individuals may call (866) 346-3236 to find a D.O. in their community.In recognition of NOM Week, I would like to congratulate the over 1,700 D.O.s in Missouri, the 616 students at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, 871 students at the University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine and the 47,000 D.O.s represented by the American Osteopathic Association for their contributions to the good health of the American people. ,2015-03-17 19:10:28.301313,2015-03-17 19:10:28.301313,Senate,NATIONAL OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE WEEK,2002-10-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-10-02/html/CREC-2002-10-02-pt1-PgS9843-2.htm,127,0,148,S9843-S9844,B000611,mr. bond
2577,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, this House has precious little time left in this session. Today we finished important business on Iraq. We worked across the aisle with Republican colleagues to come up with that resolution. We could use that same type of framework to get more of the Nation's business done if the Republican leadership would put aside their my-way-or-the-highway attitude and reach across the aisle to work out a bipartisan economic plan for our country.We should not be passing 7-day CRs when the Republican leadership has no plan to actually complete the Nation's business when people are looking to us for leadership.I will vote against this continuing resolution.Since we returned from our August recess, we have done nothing, practically nothing of substance aside from the Iraq resolution. We have had nothing on the schedule. We have spent all of our time, the people's time, on meaningless ``Non-Sense of the House'' resolutions urging the Senate to pass tax cuts for the wealthy beginning in 2011. Their resolutions have no legal force. Their so-called economic program would affect no one until 2011. What are people going to do between now and 2011? People are suffering today. They are receiving their 401(k) statements this week. The stock market is falling like a lead balloon. People are out of work, and they are giving up hope of finding new jobs.This economy is in the tank and some people have been put out of work through no fault of their own and many cannot find a new job. The Republican leadership has a failed economic plan that has contributed to the conditions that we are living with today. Republicans cannot even pass a budget to provide for the Nation's critical priorities. A responsible House right now would be addressing the people's serious concerns that they face in their day-to-day lives.In the few remaining days, this Congress should extend unemployment benefits for people who are still trying to find work in a struggling economy, pass a real pension bill that helps secure people's retirement savings against future Enrons, close the loophole that allows corporations to incorporate overseas to avoid paying taxes. We could pass a good generic drug reform bill that will help lower the cost of prescription medicine now, and we could finish our legislation for education, health care, worker programs so that we can make good on our commitment to actually leave no child behind, and we could provide adequate resources to ensure excellent health care for our Nation's seniors and provide our workers with adequate help to weather these rough times.If Republicans continue to duck their responsibilities, there will be serious consequences in people's lives. Their inability to act will lead to cuts in education, homeland defense, medical care for veterans, and the National Institutes of Health; and the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has made this plain.I think the inaction today is unacceptable.As we did earlier today, we need to come together on a bipartisan plan of action to solve our serious economic problems and address the most important problems people are facing right now. Let us not leave here before we address that agenda. Let us not have a 7-day continuing resolution. Let us have a 1- or a 2-day continuing resolution. Let us stay here and do the people's work. We will not win the war against terrorism if the economy of this country is imploding around our ears. We will only beat terrorism if we have a strong economy with good jobs and good wages for the American people.,2015-03-17 19:10:28.544486,2015-03-17 19:10:28.544486,House,FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2003,2002-10-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-10-10/html/CREC-2002-10-10-pt1-PgH7825-2.htm,133,4,148,H7825-H7836,G000132,mr. gephardt

2579,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Bill Hamann, former resident of Lexington, Missouri. He was 87.Bill, a son of the late William G. and Mary Curtis Hamann, was born in Henrietta, Missouri, on October 12, 1912. His dedication to football began on the Richmond High School football team and continued at Graceland Junior College in Lamoni, Iowa, where he also lettered in basketball. His greatest satisfaction as a player was playing center for the Missouri University Tigers under coach Don Faurot, A special influence in his life.After graduation, Bill coached football at Odessa High School for two years before joining the United States Navy during World War II. He served in the Navy until November 1945, making lieutenant before he returned to Missouri University to complete his master's degree.In 1946, Bill moved to Lexington and began coaching football in earnest at Lexington High School. In his first year, he led the team to their first undefeated season in Lexington history. He was head football coach for 22 years, winning four more Missouri River Valley Conference (MRVC) championships.

2580,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate APWU Legislative Director Roy Braunstein on a special achievement of 20 years as a National Legislative Officer.Roy was first elected in 1980 as the APWU Legislative Aide, and was elected Legislative and Political Director in 1992. He has been elected eight times by the APWU membership. The American Postal Workers Union AFL-CIO has more than 350,000 members in every city, town and hamlet in the United States and is the world's largest postal union.Before he came to Washington, D.C. in 1980, Roy was active in the New Jersey Shore Area Local where he served as Legislative Director and Shop Stewart. He was also the New Jersey State APWU Legislative Director and Editor. He served in community affairs as a member of the Barnegat, New Jersey Board of Education for three years and as a member of the Ocean County New Jersey Mental Health Board.In Washington, Roy serves as a lobbyist for the union and has worked on a number of issues important to the membership. During his tenure at APWU, I worked closely with Roy in securing passage of the Hatch Act Reform, legislation which I authored granting greater political freedom for postal and federal employees. Roy also played a key role in the eight-year battle for the Family and Medical Leave Act which President Clinton signed into law in 1993.Over the years, Roy has worked diligently to help win passage of the Federal Employees Retirement Act, the Spouse Equity Act, the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act, the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act and many other legislative initiatives to help working families.Roy has fought to protect the viability of the Postal Service. He has been a leader in the fight against Postal Privatization, and the movement to take the Postal Service off-budget during the 1980's in an effort to stop congressional attacks on the Postal Service. APWTU is an affiliate of the AFL-CIO and Roy has worked closely with other labor leaders for the goals of this nation's working men and women.Roy's wife of 32 years, Marilyn, is also an APWU member and they are the proud parents of two young men, Rick and Daniel. He has an A.A. Degree from Kinsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York, and a B.A. Degree from Richmond College in Staten Island, New York.I am very pleased to join in recognizing the very special achievements of Roy Braunstein, whom I have known throughout his career in Washington by virtue of my previous capacity as Chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee and my current role as Ranking Democratic Member of the House Education and Work Force Committee.

2581,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the incredible philanthropy and achievement of Phil Ramone. On September 24th Mr. Ramone will be awarded the Michael Bolton Charities Lifetime Achievement Award. Michael Bolton Charities, Inc. was established in 1993 to assist children and women at risk from the effects of poverty, homelessness, domestic violence, and physical and sexual abuse. Mr. Ramone's indefatigable generosity has enhanced the lives of countless women and children around the world for over three decades. This honor stands as a testament to Mr. Ramone's selfless acts which reflect his inherent benevolence and vision of life.Throughout his remarkable career Mr. Ramone has produced award winning works by some of the world's most talented recording artists. His genius embraces all aspects of the entertainment business, working brilliantly in both the technical and creative sides of the industry. Mr. Ramone is one of the recording industry's most well respected and prolific producers with a resume so vast and encompassing that his peers have deified him as the undisputed ``Pope of Pop.'' Mr. Ramone has produced galas for several U.S. Presidents and has been the driving force behind megastars such as: Frank Sinatra, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Barbara Streisand, Madonna, B.B. King, Elton John, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, Fito Paez, Sinead O'Connor and Paul McCartney to name a few. Phil Ramone is invaluable to the artists he works with, such as Michael Bolton, and is an eight time Grammy Award winner, including Producer of the Year. As Chairman Emeritus of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, he is recognized by his peers as the most transcendent audio technician and stylistic creator in the music industry today. His grasp of technology revolutionized the recording studio with his first use of the Dolby four-track discrete sound system, satellite links, optical surround sound, fiber optic systems, and digital live recording.In addition to all of these accomplishments and accolades, Mr. Ramone possesses a kindness and humility that make him one of the recording industry's most profound humanitarians. Since his earliest success Mr. Ramone's charitable commitment has helped children living in poverty around the world improve their education and their lives. It is with great respect and appreciation that we acknowledge Mr. Ramone's lifetime charitable achievements and his exemplary character on September 24. I commend Michael Bolton Charities, Inc., for their recognition of Phil Ramone's lifelong contributions to both music and humankind.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing gratitude to Grammy winner Michael Bolton for his steadfast efforts to educate the Congress on the need to assist women and children at risk from the dangerous effects of poverty, domestic violence, homelessness, and physical and sexual abuse. With programs that foster self esteem, leadership skills, job training, and social awareness his charity provides the access and education that underprivileged women and children need for a better life.Phil Ramone has a positive outlook and steadfast commitment to a better future for all our children when he notes that, ``Our kids won't even think about virtual reality--it will be a regular part of their lives. Sometimes it's just so obvious to me, the future. It shows its face to me ever so often and then I say, `Oh, of course. Why shouldn't we do this . . .' It's like an inner vision that lets you understand that there's something better, more beautiful just ahead.''

2582,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, this budget is our common sense vision, our road map for a new century and a new economy. Our budget rejects the misguided and extreme policies and priorities of this Republican slash-and-burn budget and comes up with a moderate and responsible alternative.The Republican leadership has put forward a budget that is so unfair and unwise that it is already dead on arrival. It is unacceptable, not only to many Democrats, but also to many Republicans as well.I have been amused to hear the answers to questions about the budget. There is so little specificity because no one seems able to put the specificity behind the budget that it needs. So we hear, ``Well, that problem will be handled in conference.'' Translated, that means we are going to have the Domenici budget, I suppose, because everything is going to get settled in conference.This Republican budget is expired milk poured into new cartons. It is more of the same fiscal radicalism based on the same irresponsible cuts which the American people specifically rejected in the election of 1996. Do not be fooled. This budget that we are voting on in the next few minutes is the same budget that we had in 1995 from the Contract on America.The Republican path steers us into a dead end, where American families fend for themselves and are at the mercy of the global marketplace. They want to withdraw from our commitments to education, to health care and the environment, key areas critical to the future of our country and the prosperity of our people.Democrats are united behind a different vision, the vision contained in the Democratic alternative. We want to build upon the economic success that we currently enjoy, a success that owes a lot to the Democratic budget of 1993, a budget that we passed without one Republican vote in the House or in the Senate. If it were up to the Republicans in Congress, we would not have made the wise and prudent fiscal choices that have brought about the strongest economy that we have seen in decades in this country.We have more work that still needs to be done. Democrats want to meet the challenges presented to us by the changing economy and workplace. Government must play a limited, but critical role in ensuring that the growth we currently enjoy continues and its benefits are widely shared by all working families.While Republicans talk about protecting Americans and their retirement, their budget threatens the safety and integrity of Social Security. The Democratic budget ensures that any surplus will be used to protect the foundation of retirement security for all Americans.While Republicans talk a lot about the breakdown of the American family, the Democratic budget does something to actually address the problem. The Democratic budget makes a commitment to an act, the Patients Bill of Rights Act, so that families will receive the health care they need and pay for.Our budget makes the investments in child care, which will enable Americans to balance the needs of their families with their demands from work.The Democratic budget makes the smart investments in education that we desperately need to modernize and upgrade our public schools so our kids receive the knowledge and the skills they need to compete in a world marketplace.While the Republicans profess to care about preserving the environment, their budget makes drastic cuts in environmental protection. Democrats are fighting to safeguard our natural heritage by increasing the funding of toxic waste cleanups and expanding parks and open spaces.The Kasich budget has been repudiated by moderate Republicans. It has been renounced by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle). It has been ridiculed by Pete Domenici, and it should be rejected by this Congress.I urge my colleagues to support the Spratt substitute, the only honest and responsible budget alternative that has been before us.,2015-03-17 19:10:29.401089,2015-03-17 19:10:29.401089,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999,1998-06-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-05/html/CREC-1998-06-05-pt1-PgH4188.htm,72,103,144,H4188-H4226,G000132,mr. gephardt
2583,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Coats, the Chairman of the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Children and Families, for the excellent work he has done in drafting legislation to reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant, which recently passed in the Senate. The CSBG program is intended to fight poverty and alleviate its effects on people and their communities. Through these block grants, federal money is given to the states and local communities to create programs that help low-income people secure employment, get an adequate education, make better use of their available income, obtain and maintain adequate housing, and ultimately achieve self-sufficiency.These block grants free states and local communities of federal red tape and give them the flexibility they desire to initiate programs that meet the needs of people who need help. As a former governor, I learned that state and local governments are far more effective in serving local communities than Washington's bureaucracy.Further, Community Services Block Grants provide opportunities for the government to partner with the non-governmental sector to provide a variety of services to the poor. I am grateful that Senator Coats has led a bipartisan effort to include within this reauthorization bill language that can expand the opportunities for charitable and faith-based organizations to serve their communities with CSBG funds. The provisions included will help faith-based organizations to maintain their religious character and integrity when providing social services with government funds.For years, America's charities and churches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. As a matter of sound public policy, we in Congress need to find ways to allow these successful organizations to unleash the cultural remedy that our society so desperately needs. Senator Coats' legislation reauthorizing the Community Services Block Grant will help to further this goal.The language in this bill regarding charitable and faith-based providers is similar to my Charitable Choice provision contained in the welfare reform law which we passed two years ago, but it does contain some differences. For non-governmental organizations wishing to participate in both the Community Service Block Grant and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs, the differences between the two provisions may cause some confusion and lead to additional administrative burdens.This situation demonstrates the need to pass legislation that applies the same Charitable Choice language to all federally funded social service programs in which the government is authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide services to beneficiaries. Under my Charitable Choice Expansion Act, which I introduced in May of this year, uniform protections and guidelines would apply to faith-based entities using federal dollars to provide housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, juvenile services, seniors services, abstinence education, and child welfare services, as well as services under the Community Development Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, and of course, the Community Services Block Grant. One uniform Charitable Choice provision will certainly make it easier for both the government and faith-based organizations to work together more efficiently to help our nation's needy.Again, I thank Senator Coats and all the members of the Labor Committee, as well as their staff, for their hard work on this legislation, and I commend them for their decision to include provisions that invite the greater participation of charitable and faith-based providers in the Community Services Block Grant program. I hope that we in the Senate will continue working together to pursue legislative proposals that encourage successful non-governmental organizations to expand their life-transforming programs to serve our nation's poor and needy.,2015-03-17 19:10:29.659271,2015-03-17 19:10:29.659271,Senate,COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT LEGISLATION,1998-07-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-30/html/CREC-1998-07-30-pt2-PgS9421-3.htm,105,0,144,S9421,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2584,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the H.R. 4274, the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill, because through it the House Republicans propose to make drastic cuts in many programs that are vitally important to all Americans, but especially to those most in need whose very survival and growth depends upon the assistance they receive from their government. Fortunately, however, this destructive bill is going nowhere and every Member of this body knows it for the sham that it is. The Republican leadership recognizes they don't have the votes to pass it and are negotiating to include another version of this measure in the Omnibus spending bill.The funding levels in the bill, as reported, fall $2 billion short of what democrats believe is needed to improve our schools and prepare our children for the 21st Century. There are no funds for America Reads, which helps endure that all children can read well when they complete the third grade. There are no funds to help communities hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size so that students can have a better chance to learn. There are no funds to help communities modernize and build schools that provide safe and appropriate learning environments. Clearly, there is nothing in this bill that reflects any investment in the future of public education. In fact, this bill grossly underfunds existing and proven educational programs upon which we have long relied.Later today, this body will consider a bipartisan conference report reauthorizing the Head Start program, yet this appropriations bill would provide $160 million less than what the President has requested to run Head Start next year. A second bipartisan conference report to be taken up today extending child nutrition programs, would authorize new funds for meal supplements to induce greater participation in after-school programs. This appropriations bill, however, would provide $140 million less than what the President requested to operate these very same after-school programs. I can't imagine how any Member who would vote today to reauthorize our Head Start and nutrition programs could, in good conscience, support these devastating cuts.Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, the cuts don't stop here, there are many many more. For example, funding for Title I, bilingual education, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Work-Study, and School to Work are all cut. Without the assistance there programs, provide, thousands of disadvantaged students will be deprived of both the educational and career opportunities they need to succeed in life.Our nation's labor force also suffers under this appropriations bill. It cuts funding for critical worker protection programs run by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Several regulatory riders are attached that compromise these agencies' effectiveness. In addition, the bill undermines efforts to help our youth enter the workforce by completely defunding the Summer Jobs Program and the President's Youth Opportunity Areas Initiative.Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill eliminates funding for the Low Income Energy Assistance Program which provides heating and cooling assistance for over 5.5 million low and fixed-income households. With winter approaching, many of those who have relied on this program may soon be forced to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families. That should be totally unacceptable in a nation as prosperous as ours. But rather than meet this urgent need, Republicans would rather squander available dollars on tax cuts for the wealthy.Mr. Chairman, this is a bad bill that hurts students, working families, and our most neediest families. I strongly urge Members to oppose it.Thank you Mr. Chairman.The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter).,2015-03-17 19:10:29.943481,2015-03-17 19:10:29.943481,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999,1998-10-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-08/html/CREC-1998-10-08-pt2-PgH10137.htm,140,8,144,H10137-H10148,C000488,mr. clay
2585,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Fontbonne College in St. Louis, Missouri. On October 15, 1998, Fontbonne College will celebrate its 75th anniversary.Fontbonne has served more than 10,000 graduates in pursuit of academic excellence. As Fontbonne moves toward the 21st century, it is looking to continue the ministry of higher education begun by the sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.Fontbonne's history goes back to seventeenth century France, the beginning of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In LePuy, France in 1647, six women under the direction of Jesuit priest Father Jean Pierre Medaille were brought together to dedicate their lives to the spiritual and material needs of the people. The order was publicly recognized as the Sisters of St. Joseph on October 15, 1650.Around 1778, Jeanne Fontbonne entered the congregation, received the name of Sister St. John Fontbonne, and later became the Mother Superior at Monistrol. With the violence of the French Revolution, the sisters were forced to disband. Several were imprisoned and executed. After the death of Robespierre, the day before Mother St. John was to be executed, she was released and asked to reform the congregation. In 1807, 12 women celebrated the rebirth of the Sisters of St. Joseph.Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis asked Mother St. John to send sisters to the area to teach the deaf. Six sisters set sail for America and established its current home in Carondelet, on the southern border of St. Louis. A log cabin built on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River became the ``cradle of the congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.''The sisters opened a day school in the area, a school for deaf and a girl's high school. With these successes, the sisters discussed a new twentieth century idea--higher education of women.Fontbonne College was chartered on April 17, 1917, but the entrance of the United States in World War I in that year precluded the beginning of classes. Construction at the Clayton location started in 1924. The first Fontbonne class began in 1923 at St. Joseph's Academy. New buildings were ready for the fall term of 1925. On June 18, 1927, Fontbonne conferred its first bachelor of arts degree on eight women.Since its beginnings in 1923, Fontbonne has changed with and been ahead of the times, but has also kept its identity. Fontbonne admitted African American students in 1947, eight years before the Supreme Court's school desegregation decision. Male students were admitted in selective majors in 1971, then in 1974 all classes were opened to men and women. In the 1980s, Fontbonne created degree programs with flexible scheduling to meet the needs of working students. Now Fontbonne has its first male president.Today Fontbonne is deeply rooted in the tradition and values--quality, respect, diversity, community, justice, service, faith and Catholic presence--of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.I commend Fontbonne College staff and students for their dedication and perseverance throughout the college's many years of existence and hope they continue to enrich the St. Louis community for years to come. ,2015-03-17 19:10:30.178642,2015-03-17 19:10:30.178642,Senate,TRIBUTE TO FONTBONNE COLLEGE ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY,1998-10-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-09/html/CREC-1998-10-09-pt1-PgS12219.htm,141,0,144,S12219-S12220,B000611,mr. bond
2586,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend John Q. Hammons, who is well known in the Ozarks and beyond for accomplishments that have affected the lives of many in countless ways. Mr. Hammons has deep roots in southwest Missouri. He was born in Newton County and after finishing high school Mr. Hammons attended Monett Junior College and Southwest Missouri State University where he completed his bachelor's degree. HIs adult road to success began at Cassville High as a teacher and coach, and then as a cost engineer for the Alaska Highway. He served his country in World War II as a lieutenant (jg) on Navy troop transports in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.Living in southwest Missouri it is difficult to not be aware of the many real estate developments his vision has produced. Some outstanding projects include the Glen Isle Center, Southern Hills, Village Garden Apartments, Kimberling City, University Plaza Hotel, the Springfield Trade and Convention Center, Highland Springs Country Club, and the Hammons Towers. His most recent and highly recognized development is the Chateau on the Lake Hotel and Convention Center near Table Rock Dam, a resort likely to receive national renown. His business ventures have provided a multitude of jobs and opportunities. John Q. demonstrated his commitment to community improvements by donating the land and the supporting architectural services for the recently built headquarters for the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce.John Q. is well known to many outside the business community through his contributions to education, the arts, athletics, and medicine. In the field of education Mr. Hammons has generously given back to Southwest Missouri State University including the Hammons House dormitory and the Hammons Student Center, where 9,000 watch Bears basketball. At Drury College he helped to initiate the support and the ensuing construction of the Hammons School of Architecture. He was one of the founders of the Springfield Public Schools Foundation Challenge Grants to increase their computer technology and provide for the distribution of the Springfield News Leader and USA Today in the classroom.John and his wife, Juanita, recognized the need to continue the development of the arts and gave major contributions to help build the Juanita K. Hammons Hall for the Performing Arts at Southwest Missouri State University. For those individuals who enjoy public television the Hammons provided the founder's gift to establish the Ozarks Public Television station and they have continued their support with Challenge Grants.For the sports enthusiast, he donated the land and five million dollars to build the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame to help recognize those in Missouri who have excelled athletically. Those individuals in need of medical assistance have been especially thankful to Mr. Hammons for his donations to the St. Johns Regional Health Center which have included the Hammons Life Line emergency helicopter, a heart wing and the Hammons Heart Institute.It would be easy to mention many other notable accomplishments but perhaps it is enough to remember that he has reached each of these goals one day at a time with persistence and hard work. We thank John Q. Hammons for his contributions and his examples.,2015-03-17 19:10:30.310735,2015-03-17 19:10:30.310735,Extensions,HONORING JOHN Q.

2587,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and for my colleagues' indulgence, especially since I have spoken a couple of times in the last 2 days, which is more commonly than I normally speak on the House floor.This is an issue I feel strongly about, Mr. Chairman. I think it is a shame. I think it is sad that so many people inside this House and outside this House have been fighting to the last ditch on behalf of the system that has trapped thousands and thousands of poor parents and their children in schools where they are not safe, where they do not learn, and where none of us would send our own children: The D.C. public schools.Now, we have had discussions, on this side of the aisle anyway, about the problems these schools are having. One of my colleagues said it needs some improvement. Well, that is correct. Seventy-eight percent of the 4th graders in the D.C. Public School System cannot read up to the national average. What will happen to those kids, Mr. Chairman? Do my colleagues know what happens to children if by the 4th grade they cannot read?This is a system that closed down the schools for 3 weeks at the beginning of the year without any notice to the parents, closed down all the schools because the roofs were falling in.We have heard a lot of arguments against this little scholarship program in this bill. It only affects 3 percent of the kids. That is because we are having difficulty getting the money even to do that. Another one: We cannot let any of these kids escape. We have to hold them all hostage to this system until we can make the whole system better.How many of us would put our own kids in this system on the gamble that the system will change fast enough so that our kids will not be mired in a career and a life that will not be successful? Very few people do. Last year this provision was filibustered to death in the Senate by 41 Senators, none of whom sent their kids to the D.C. public schools.And the argument I like the best is, we cannot use scarce public resources for this. What is scarce in the District of Columbia is not resources, but education. The District has $7300 per pupil to spend on education. The Washington Post had it right in its headline on this subject. It is a well-financed failure. The system protects jobs while shortchanging classrooms. That is why the roofs are not fixed.Mr. Chairman, I feel kind of personal about this. I have stood with a lot of these parents as they have asked desperately for the right to give their kids a future. I have stood with them in the District of Columbia and I have stood with them in Indianapolis. I asked them there how important school choice was to them, because I knew how controversial it was here. They answered the way myself and colleagues would answer.Look, I know where the money and the strings and the power is on this. Stand with the parents and these kids. It is their future that is at stake. We should do for them what we would do for ourselves if we were in the same situation.

2588,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to congratulate and pay tribute to Archie D. Barrett, who recently retired from his position as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army, Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Mr. Barrett served our Nation for 44 years, as an Air Force fighter pilot, a member of the professional staff of the Armed Services Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, and finally in his most recent position where he was the principal advisor to the Assistant Secretary of the Army on all Department of the Army policy and activities pertaining to manpower and force structure.Archie D. Barrett was born in Paris, TX, on August 13, 1935. Following graduation from high school, he accepted an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from West Point in 1957, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. During his distinguished 24 year career in the Air Force, Mr. Barrett served in a variety of assignments, including an assignment as an F-4 fighter pilot in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict. Along the way, he earned both a masters and a doctorate from Harvard University. He retired as a colonel in 1981.After retiring from the Air Force, Arch began 13 years of service as a professional staff member of the then House Armed Services Committee. He served on both the Subcommittee on Investigations and the Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel, where his responsibilities included participation in the investigation of the terrorist bombing of the Marine headquarters in Lebanon. I worked very closely with him when I chaired the panel on military education of the House Armed Services Committee. His thorough knowledge of the defense education system helped the panel formulate needed reforms in this area.Arch Barrett will be best remembered in Congress for his work on the hearings and legislative proposals on defense reorganization, culminating in the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. It was my privilege to work with Arch on this issue, and his expertise on Department of Defense organization proved invaluable to Congress and the Nation. Indeed, his book on this subject, ``Reappraising Defense Organizational,'' was published in 1983. It is not overstating it to say that this legislation, which helped win the gulf war, would not have become law without the tireless and devoted efforts of Arch Barrett.Mr. Speaker, Archie D. Barrett is a national treasure. Although he is retiring from the Government, I am sure that he has many more productive years of service ahead of him, and that we will be able to call upon his wise counsel when needed. I know the Members of the House will join me in extending our heartfelt gratitude and best wishes in the years ahead to Arch and his family--his wife Miriam, who joins him in retirement from her position in the office of our colleague Martin Olav Sabo, and his three children, Julie Ann Heady, Cynthia Dawn Barrett, and Archie Don, Jr.,2015-03-17 19:10:30.836109,2015-03-17 19:10:30.836109,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO ARCHIE D.

Marian has dedicated her life to her family and to her community and to the State of Israel.Marian was born in 1916 in Kansas City, MO, the second child of Edith and Benjamin Bell. She graduated from Linwood Elementary School and Central High School. Marian attended the Kansas City Art Institute, the University of Kansas, and the University of Tulsa. In 1940 she married Nathan Wedlan of Kansas City where they lived most of their married life. The had two daughter, Myrna who is married to David Lyons and Bobbi who is married to Larrie Weil.Marian first visited Israel in 1973 with her husband who died later that year. In 1978 she moved to Wichita, KS, to marry Joseph Klebanoff who has two sons, Gary and Alan. She and Joe have been blessed with seven wonderful grandchildren: Jonathan Wedlan Lyons, Brett Harrison Lyons, Parker Anders Weil, Sarah Marion Weil, Sarah Annie Klebanoff, David James Klebanoff, and Kara Klebanoff.Marian's devotion to her family is equaled only by her commitment to helping others. She began her public service as a high school student when she volunteered at Congregation Beth Shalom in Kansas City, MO, as a librarian. A great lover of children, Marian taught Sunday school and nursery school and was camp director at Beth Shalom.Marian has lived several places during her adult life and has always been actively involved in her community. In Kansas City Marian served as the director of Jewish education and art gallery coordinator for the Jewish Community Center; she also was a board member of Congregation Beth Shalom Sisterhood, National Council of Jewish Women, Hadassah, and Jewish Federation. While living in Tulsa, OK, Marian was president of the National Council of Jewish Women and served on the board of directors of Hadassah, Jewish Federation, and ORT.More recently Marian has served on the board of directors of Jewish Federation of Wichita, Temple Emanu-El Temple, Temple Emanu-El Sisterhood, Hadassah, and B'nai N'rith Women. She has been president of Temple Emanu-El Sisterhood and also has served as chairperson of the Education and Anti-Defamation League communities as well co-chair of the women's division of the Jewish Federation. Marian is also a member of the Wichita Gardens Botanica, Wichita Art Museum, Wichita Center for the Arts, Wichita Symphony Association, Wichita-Sedgwick County Historical Museum, American Civil Liberties Union, and the Mainstream Coalition.I am proud to list the many organizations with which Marian has worked, but Marian's life has been much more than the sum of all the wonderful parts. The Hebrew language has no word which directly corresponds to the English word ``charity.'' The closest word for ``charity'' in Hebrew is ``Tzedakah'' which is a Judiac admonition to be righteous, compassionate, and, above all, help one's fellow man. Marian is a most perfect example of this combination of community service and responsibility.I am honored to rise before this distinguished body to recognize Marian Wedlan Klebanoff who has earned my respect and that of her family and her friends. She is a worthy recipient of the State of Israel's Heritage Award for her devotion to her family, to her synagogue, to her community, and to the State of Israel.,2015-03-17 19:10:31.054270,2015-03-17 19:10:31.054270,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO MARIAN KLEBANOFF,1996-05-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-14/html/CREC-1996-05-14-pt1-PgE798-2.htm,67,0,142,E798,M000316,ms. mccarthy
2590,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise in tirbute to my distinguished colleague from Tennessee, the Honorable Harold Ford, as he prepares to retire from the U.S. House of Representatives. Congressman Ford has dedicated his life to public service. He was elected to the Tennessee State Legislature at the age of 25. He served two terms in that body and in 1974 was elected to represent the residents of Tennessee's Ninth Congressional District. Harold Ford was the first and is the only African-American Tennessean ever elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.Harold Ford has been a staunch defender of justice and equality. He has shown a special dedication to representing the needs of the underprivileged and has left his signature on our Nation's welfare and employment programs.In 1981 Congressman Ford was named chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation. Through his committee work, Chairman Ford fought to improve economic opportunities for the poor, He authored the Family Support Act of 1988, a program to increase education and training opportunities for AFDC recipients. Throughout his tenure Congressman Ford has fought to preserve the Federal role in administering domestic programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, public housing, public education, and job training.Harold Ford has been a truly effective political leader whose dedication to representing the people of Memphis cannot be overstated. Congressman Ford was instrumental in establishing several youth training programs in Memphis including Jobs Corps and Youth Fair Chance. He also gave vital support to local economic development projects in Memphis such as the Central Station renovation.Representative Ford is a man of determination and spirit who has maintained his courage and equanimity in the face of trial and adversity. He has faced racism and injustice and these challenges have only strengthened his resolve to fight for equality.Congressman Ford is a member of a family that has demonstrated a special commitment to public service. His great-grandfather served as a squire during the Post-Reconstruction Era in Tennessee. Harold Ford's brothers also serve in public office in the State of Tennessee. John Ford is a State senator, Joe Ford is a Memphis City Council member and Dr. James Ford is a Shelby County commissioner. Representative Ford's son, Harold Ford, Jr. is this year's Democratic nominee to succeed his father in the U.S. House of Representatives.Mr. Speaker, it has been my privilege to serve beside Harold Ford in the U.S. House of Representatives. He has been a loyal public servant and the people of Tennessee and our Nation will long benefit from his many contributions. Harold Ford and his wife Dorothy have been valuable friends; Carol and I will miss them dearly. I wish him godspeed as he leaves the House of Representatives and begins another chapter in his life of public service.,2015-03-17 19:10:31.188365,2015-03-17 19:10:31.188365,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN HAROLD FORD,1996-10-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-10-01/html/CREC-1996-10-01-pt1-PgE1889-4.htm,139,0,142,E1889-E1890,C000488,mr. clay
2591,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor all girls and women who participate in sports by recognizing the 13th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day, February 4, 1999.This year's theme, ``All Girls Allowed,'' reminds us we all should have an equal chance to participate in sports regardless of gender. In my youth women were discouraged from team sports and were looked down upon if active in an individual sport. ``All Girls Allowed'' characterizes how far we've come. But there is more to do. This day grants us a special time to remember past and current achievements, and reflect on the continuing struggle for equality in sports.In 1987, a Congressional Resolution created National Girls and Women in Sports Day to celebrate the achievements of Olympic volleyball player Flo Hyman and to recognize her work to assure equality for women's sports. Today we take this day to celebrate the achievements of all girls and women in sports. Communities such as mine around the country observe this day with events, luncheons, awards banquets, and parades.We can all call to mind significant women in sports who have paved the way for others including the high-profile tennis match when Billie Jean King defeated Bobby Riggs, or the recent emergency of the Women's National Basketball Association. Because of the leadership of these women, there are more sports opportunities today than there were 25 years ago. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination from extracurricular activities--including sports--in federally assisted education programs. One in three girls in high school now participate in athletics. As a former educator, I have seen firsthand the value athletics has played in building self-esteem, establishing confidence and leadership skills in young women.In the 5th District, the Women's Intersport Network for Kansas City (WIN for KC) is sponsoring a luncheon to honor local girls and women that have achieved significant goals in sports. WIN for KC was established to promote sports participation opportunities and recognition for girls and women in the Greater Kansas City area. Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics Shannon Miller will deliver the keynote address to encourage and support fellow athletes. This year's Kansas City award winners include Heather Burroughs for USA Track and Field, Janet Calandro for Spirit, Peggy Donovan for Senior Sportswoman of the Year, Linda Jones for Coach of the Year, Jean Nearing for Physically Challenged Sportswoman of the Year, Lauren Powers for Courage, and Jennifer Waterman for Mentor of the Year.Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the 13th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day, congratulate every individual for their dedication and efforts, and thank them for paving the way for other women.,2015-03-17 19:10:31.421525,2015-03-17 19:10:31.421525,Extensions,13TH ANNUAL NATIONAL GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SPORTS DAY,1999-02-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-02-02/html/CREC-1999-02-02-pt1-PgE116-2.htm,18,0,145,E116,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2592,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I think it is important to accept the fact that you have faith in the school administrator and the principal, because under the proposal of the Senator from Tennessee, and under my proposal and under the Gun-Free Schools Act for schools, which we passed, a principal has the discretion of being able to allow a student to reenter. And, if you trust the principals, you trust the school official, that is an available opportunity as it exists and would exist if we were to pass this amendment providing for uniformity, because we allow the treatment under our proposal to be identical to the treatment for any other student not the subject of an IEP. And principals have the discretion to allow such other students back into the classroom.So what we want to do is not punish anybody, we want to allow that principal to exercise his discretion in a way that is likely to promote safety in the classroom and in a way that it does not hamstring the principal.Just to give you an idea, people do not understand, and I didn't understand, what a manifestation determination is. This is a flow chart of how a manifestation determination is made under IDEA. This is a very serious process. To go through these kinds of processes and to have to jump through these legal hoops and to cause the school districts--the cheapest hearing I have been able to talk to a school superintendent about in my State is between $7,500 and $10,000, just to conduct a hearing to do in the special settings what the principal is able to do given his need to protect the safety of the school environment on his own in another setting.I think that is what we are looking at. We are not here to try to say that we want to abuse individuals who are the subject of IEPs. We passed the statutory framework designed to help disabled children. We want them to get a good education. But I submit to you that among those most exposed to the threat to safety and security in the schools when a student with a disability comes with a weapon are other disabled students.This is not a question of pitting students with a disability against other students in the classroom, this is a question about safety and security in the classroom and allowing those individuals charged with the awesome responsibility of providing for the education of our youngsters the authority to take the steps that are necessary, absent intermeddling bureaucratic barriers from Washington, to secure the school environment.Given the fact that every principal has the authority in other settings to be able to reenter a student who is appropriately at a stage to reenter the classroom, this bill would not prevent principals from having the same approach to students who were the subject of IEPs.,2015-03-17 19:10:31.777784,2015-03-17 19:10:31.777784,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-19/html/CREC-1999-05-19-pt1-PgS5507-7.htm,73,304,145,S5507-S5583,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2593,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the 90th birthday of Ms. Katherine Dunham of East St. Louis, Illinois. Besides being recognized as a Kennedy Center Honoree, as well as the recipient of over seventy international awards, Ms. Dunham has consistently used her abundance of talent and creative energy to enhance the fine arts and humanities in America and worldwide. While well known for her contributions in the areas of dance, poetry, musical composition, and choreography, Ms. Dunham has also worked to advance the causes of human rights and world peace. However, it can be argued that her greatest accomplishments have come through her 31 years of tireless educational efforts in behalf of the residents and especially the children of East St. Louis, Illinois.Born in Chicago, Illinois, Ms. Dunham has distinguished herself in both academic and artistic venues. A graduate of the University of Chicago, she is the author of ``Dances of Haiti: Their Social Organization, Classification, Form and Function,'' Further, she has shared her intellect with us by writing several books, including Dances of Haiti, Island Possessed, and A Touch of Innocence. Ms. Dunham has been recognized for her academic accomplishments as the recipient of honorary degrees from many institutions of higher education, including Brown University, Howard University, and Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Her contributions to the arts have come through various theater productions, motion pictures, operatic performances, and television presentations. Throughout Ms. Dunham's career, she has performed both nationally and internationally in major performances and famous venues, including Aida at New York's Metropolitan Opera House in As an advocate for education of the arts and humanities among the citizens of East St. Louis, Illinois, Ms. Dunham has proven her dedication to public service and community involvement for over three decades. Through the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities, she continues to provide cultural enrichment to both adults and children, while presenting opportunities for Master Artists to display and share with others their enormous talents and abilities. At age 90, she continues to develop new projects for the East St. Louis, Illinois community, including the soon to be completed African Artisanal Village on the campus of the Katherine Dunham Museum. A vision of Ms. Dunham and her late husband, John Pratt, this center will provide exposure to the arts of Africa, as well as a performing arts facility for the children of the Dunham Workshop and other visiting artists.Mr. Speaker, the city of East St. Louis, Illinois is proud to be the direct beneficiary of both Ms. Dunham's philanthropy and hands on involvement in the artistic community. It is a pleasure for me to wish Ms. Dunham a happy and healthy 90th birthday, as I look forward to the exciting new programs she has planned for the City of East St. Louis.,2015-03-17 19:10:31.998942,2015-03-17 19:10:31.998942,Extensions,IN CELEBRATION OF MS.

2594,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, Colonel Harry G. Summers, Jr., United States Army, died this week. In his passing, the Army and the Nation have lost a soldier and scholar, who ranks among the preeminent military strategists and analysts of this century.As an Army officer, who began his professional life as an enlisted soldier, and later as a military analyst, author and commentator, Colonel Summers knew personally the bayonet-point reality of war and thought and wrote widely about strategic issues. He was a decorated veteran of combat in Korea and Vietnam, awarded the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for Valor, and the legion of Merit; twice awarded the combat infantry badge; and twice awarded the Purple Heart for wounds received in combat.An infantry squad leader in the Korean conflict, he served as a battalion and corps operation officer during the Vietnam war, and later as a negotiator with the North Vietnamese in Saigon and in Hanoi. Instructor of strategy at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, he was a political-military action officer on the Army General Staff, a member of the then Army chief of staff Creighton Abrams' strategic assessment group, and served in the Office of the Army Chief of Staff from 1975 to 1980, before joining the faculty of the U.S. Army War College.At the war college, Colonel Summers was at the heart of the rebirth of strategic studies in the professional military education of our Armed Forces in the early 1980's. His book On Strategy: The Vietnam War in Context provided a critical strategic appraisal of American strategy in that war and a seminal American work in the relationship of military strategy to national policy. On Strategy has been characterized as being ``about'' the Vietnam war in much the same way that Clausewitz is ``about'' the Napoleonic wars or that Mahan is ``about'' 18th-century naval struggles between France and England. That is, Harry Summers used the Vietnam war as a vehicle for analysis and illustration of principles of war that apply universally.After his retirement from active service, Harry Summers continued to contribute to the professional development of the officer corps and to the development of strategic thought and military strategy as a lecturer, visiting professor, columnist, editor, and commentator.When Harry Summers testified before the House Armed Services Committee in December 1990 before Operation Desert Storm, he reemphasized the need for clarity of purpose and the relation of means to objective as this House wrestled with the decision to go to war against Iraq and commit U.S. military forces to protect the vital interests of the United States. He appeared before the committee again as we reviewed what happened to U.S. forces in Somalia in 1994 and provided valuable insights on the relation of military force and commitment to our national objectives and commitment in that country.Harry Summers was justifiably proud of his sons and their service as Army officers and of his daughter-in-law who served as a warrant officer in the Persian Gulf War. In all this, he was supported by his wife, Eloise. My good friend, Floyd Spence, the chairman of the House Armed Services, joins me in sending our sympathies to them at this time.Colonel Harry Summers made a tremendous contribution to the rebirth of the study of military strategy and to the professional military education of our armed forces, and that legacy lives on after him. His commitment to the Nation and the Army that he loved was unstinting. The Nation and the Army are poorer for his passing.,2015-03-17 19:10:32.143042,2015-03-17 19:10:32.143042,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO COLONEL HARRY SUMMERS,1999-11-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-18/html/CREC-1999-11-18-pt1-PgE2453-3.htm,164,0,145,E2453,S000465,mr. skelton

Her dedicated community service has brought professionalism and compassion to every endeavor she has so graciously undertaken. Her dedication and commitment to Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and the public is the reason for this recognition and celebration.Rev. Boyd served as the 22nd National President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., from 2000 2004. She accomplished many things during her time as president including the building of a home for AIDS orphans in Swaziland, establishing the Delta Computer Training Center in Lesotho and establishing the Leadership DELTA training program. Also, she established project SEE, which promotes the learning of math and science for middle school African American girls.Rev. Boyd is the perfect example of someone who continues to make a difference, as she has never backed away from a challenge that helps her community or those in need. Her imprint can be found in such worthy initiatives as Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center and Education Across the Miles. She is also responsible for the coordination of HBCU initiatives.As the first African American to earn a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Yale University, Rev. Boyd championed issues and worked for solutions. Over the years her stature continues to grow as she is an active member on numerous boards, foundations and committees. Her admirable work is as diversified as her many interests, resulting in a positive impact on the community and greater quality of life.Rev. Gwendolyn Boyd demonstrates in her everyday actions and words that determination is the pathway to success. She is an ordained itinerant elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. She earned her Master's of Divinity degree with honors from Howard University and she serves as the Executive Minister for Church Operations at Ebenezer A.M.E. Church in Fort Washington, Maryland.Rev. Boyd has dedicated numerous hours to developing and enriching the lives of our youth. She was nominated by President Obama and served on the Board of Trustees of the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation. She is an advocate for young people interested in careers in the engineering, science, and math fields. Rev.

2596,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of a dynamic lady who has had a strong influence in promoting our community's cultural legacy. As we celebrate the artistic achievement of our high school artists at the annual Congressional Art Competition, it is appropriate to honor a patron of the arts, Ms. Pat Jordan. She knows Kansas City, Missouri, as this is where she grew up, attending Southeast High School in the heart of the City. She obtained a degree from the University of Missouri in Journalism, which gave her the tools to investigate, promote and educate what she loves most, the arts.The rich cultural history of African Americans who lived in a segregated Kansas City during the 1920's, 30's and 40's can be traced to the area centered on 18th and Vine. This is where the black community lived, worked, worshipped, and cultivated a unique lifestyle preserved in the arts, education and sports of the time. More than most, Pat realizes the importance of preservation of an era that was indigenous to the area but with time has faded. She understands that a culture uniquely African American must not be allowed to fade. Through the arts and education, this culture will be revealed and celebrated along with today's artist who expresses their interest through artistic discovery.While I served on the Kansas City, Missouri City Council and later as Mayor, my goal was to preserve the history of 18th and Vine by restoring the area. This is when I met the enthusiastic Pat Jordan, who I enlisted to spearhead the renovation of the Gem Theater. She worked on the Gem Theater bond fund that was essential in making the renovation of the Gem Theater a reality. She continues to promote the area with the Gem Cultural and Educational Center that promotes visual and performing artists.Presently, Pat serves as Co-Chair of the Mayor's Task Force for the Arts; Chairman of The Light in the Other Room for Kansas City African American Artists; Member of the Arts Committee for the Mayor's Google Task Force and President of Cross-Lines Towers, Inc. She has an amazing record of public service and has served on many advisory boards. She has been a long time supporter and member of the Advisory Boards of the Kansas City Friends of Alvin Ailey, the William Jewel Fine Arts Series and the Department of Architecture, Urban Planning & Design of the University of Missouri at Kansas City.This summer, Kansas City will host the 2012 All-Star Baseball Game. Pat is instrumental in efforts that will bring out-of-town guests to the heart of 18th and Vine. There, visitors will enjoy an iconic culture uniquely Kansas City at the Gem Theater, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, and the American Jazz Museum.Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Ms. Pat Jordan for seeing beyond a concept, working to achieve a goal, and proudly promoting cultural enhancement through the arts. Through her outreach and events, local artists are introduced and Kansas City talent is exhibited. Her accomplishments are many as she is one of the gems for our community.,2015-03-17 19:10:32.532319,2015-03-17 19:10:32.532319,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MS.

2597,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Duane Meyer, historian, educator, author, former university president and my friend. Fittingly, the Greene County Historical Society honored Dr. Meyer in October with its Life Time Achievement Award for his body of work enriching Missouri's educational, historical and cultural life.Dr. Meyer, through his dedication, is recognized as one of Missouri's most distinguished historians. Dr. Meyer served as a teacher for 18 years and as an administrator for 22 years (1971-1983 as president of what is today Missouri State University). He arrived in Springfield in 1955 with a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Dr. Meyer began his career as an assistant professor of history and later became a full professor of history. By 1961 he was dean of facilities for what was then Southwest Missouri State College. Ten years later Dr. Meyer was selected as the sixth president of Southwest Missouri State College, which earned university status in 1972.During his 12 years at the helm of Southwest Missouri State University, enrollment increased to an all-time high (62 percent), making it the second largest 4-year public institution of higher learning in Missouri. Southwest Missouri State University was transformed with the creation of an academic master plan, including a new business school, construction of a student event center and elevation of the athletic program to NCAA Division I competition. Academic achievements included new specialist degrees for graduate programs, new associate degrees for undergraduate students and cooperative education. Students were also given the opportunity to have learning experiences abroad. Faculty research was encouraged and research and service centers took form at Southwest Missouri State University during Dr. Meyer's tenure as president.As the academic landscape changed, so did the look of the campus. The campus expanded to 125 acres, the first public-private building--Hammons Student Center--was constructed along with three new classroom buildings and four new residence halls. During that period, Southwest Missouri State University added the State Fruit Experiment Station in Mountain Grove and a new campus in West Plains, Missouri. In recognition of his contributions, Southwest Missouri State University honored Dr. Meyer by naming the school's new library after him.After leaving the president's office, Dr. Meyer continued to teach as a professor emeritus of history. He also served as a member on the Missouri Council of Public Higher Education Board and on the Missouri Humanities Council. Dr. Meyer's research has produced two text books, including The Heritage of Missouri: A History, which serves as a valuable reference for students learning about Missouri history.Dr. Meyer's leadership and dedication to excellence have reshaped one of the region's great universities and benefited countless students who have passed through its halls. Congratulations to Dr. Meyer for enhancing our understanding of Missouri history and making it available for future generations. ,2015-03-17 19:10:32.654406,2015-03-17 19:10:32.654406,Senate,TRIBUTE TO DR.

2598,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former Congressman William H. Gray III, who suddenly passed away last week in London. As politicians, we all have certain people that we looked up to as role models and mentors so that we could carry out our duties in a dignified manner. For myself, I had my father, former Congressman Bill Clay, and Mr. Gray. During my youth, I served as a doorman for the House of Representatives where I had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Gray on numerous occasions. Over time, I had developed profound respect for Mr. Gray. He was a man that had a sincere interest in the concerns of his constituents and a man that fought for minorities across the country during a time when racial tensions were still high.Mr. Gray was elected to the Congress in 1978, representing Pennsylvania's 2nd Congressional District. Many remember Mr. Gray for his quick rise within the Democratic Party. From 1985 to 1989, Mr. Gray was the chairman of the House Budget Committee--the first African American to do so. He used his power as chairman to influence legislation and economic sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa, which sparked a close friendship between him and Nelson Mandela. In 1989, he was the first African American to serve as the Majority Whip and many saw this as his stepping stone to becoming the first African American Speaker of the House.Aside from the powerful roles that he assumed in Congress, Mr. Gray is remembered most for his contributions to the city of Philadelphia, through his preaching and leadership. Since 1972, Mr. Gray served as the pastor at Bright Hope Baptist Church in Philadelphia. Even while serving in Congress, Mr. Gray never lost sight of his role as the spiritual leader of his community. On numerous occasions, Mr. Gray would say, ``First and foremost, I am a Baptist preacher.'' Through his leadership in Congress, Mr. Gray secured needed funding for Philadelphia's transportation and school systems. His success in Congress was secured by his ability to reach across party lines in order to build strong bipartisan coalitions.Mr. Gray's story began at Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia. One day, Mr. Gray's father was invited to speak to the students. Before taking the stage, the principal told Mr. Gray's father, ``Don't worry, you can keep it short; these kids aren't going anywhere.'' His father replied, ``I don't know about these other kids, but I know one kid who is going somewhere.'' His father's intuition proved to be more than accurate. A gifted basketball player, Mr. Gray accepted a scholarship to play at Franklin and Marshall College. After receiving his bachelor's degree, he went on to receive master's degrees from Drew Theological Seminary and Princeton Theological Seminary as well as spending time abroad studying at Oxford University in England. Education was held in a high regard to Mr. Gray. During the prime of his political career, Mr. Gray resigned from Congress to assume a ``higher calling'' as president of the United Negro College Fund. While many politicians abruptly resign in light of scandal, Mr. Gray resigned in order to ``open the door to higher education for a million more black men and women.'' During his time as president, Mr. Gray successfully raised over $2 billion for the UNCF.Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus and on behalf of Congressmen, past and present that were influenced by Mr. Gray's leadership, I would like to express my gratitude for his service to minorities, Congress, and to the United States of America.

Fifty years ago today, this body confirmed Mrs. Freeman as President Lyndon B. Johnson's choice to be the first female Commissioner to serve on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She served honorably in this capacity for 16 years, having been reappointed by Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.By the time President Johnson first nominated Mrs. Freeman to the Civil Rights Commission, she had worked tirelessly to end racial discrimination and secure equality, justice and fairness for every citizen. Born Marie Frankie Muse on November 24, 1916 in Danville, VA to parents who experienced the benefits of formal education and who in turn supported their daughter's educational pursuits, Frankie was educated in Virginia and attended college at the distinguished and well-known historically black college Hampton University. Almost 10 years after she started college, Frankie began her law school career at Howard University School of Law, where she graduated second in her class. Soon afterward, Frankie settled in St. Louis, MO, and began her successful career as a civil rights attorney. She worked on a variety of important civil rights issues ranging from education to hiring practices. Most notably in 1954, Frankie argued and won the fight against racial discrimination in public housing in the landmark NAACP case Davis et al. v. St. Louis Housing Authority. The following year, Frankie became the first associate general counsel of the St. Louis Housing Authority and Land Clearance Authority. Three years later in 1958, she joined the Missouri advisory committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The quality and breadth of her work combined with her passion for advocacy eventually led to her selection as a U.S. Civil Rights commissioner.In the five decades since her historic appointment, Frankie's energy and devotion to justice has not diminished. She has received appointments from former Presidents to serve on other service-related commissions. In addition, she worked as a municipal court judge for many years and was instrumental in the formation of the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, an organization that seeks to ensure the Federal Government's vigilance in its enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. In addition to this public service, Frankie wrote a book about her storied life and career. Just 6 years ago at the age of 92, she retired after spending the latter part of her career in private practice. Not surprisingly, even retirement has not slowed Frankie down. She remains active on a number of urban and community service-based social welfare boards.To countless residents of my State and across the country, Frankie Muse Freeman is a hero. She is a woman who grew up in Jim Crow-era South when racial segregation was legal. Growing up, if Frankie wanted to go somewhere, her options were to either walk or take the segregated streetcar. She witnessed first hand the harsh consequences of racial inequality and she chose to devote her entire career to ending that injustice. Frankie is an inspiration to so many Americans, across all racial lines, and to me personally. She is a public servant whom my children and grandchildren can look up to. Because of leaders like her, who fought and sacrificed but ultimately believed in our country's ability to empathize and change, we are all better off and our lives more enriched.Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. Frankie Muse Freeman on the 50th anniversary of her Senate confirmation to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. In addition, I ask my colleagues to recognize Frankie's distinguished service to the people of this country.,2015-03-17 19:10:33.132741,2015-03-17 19:10:33.132741,Senate,TRIBUTE TO FRANKIE MUSE FREEMAN,2014-09-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-09-15/html/CREC-2014-09-15-pt1-PgS5583.htm,131,0,160,S5583,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2600,MO,Vicky,Hartzler,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the eightieth birthday of a distinguished member of Missouri's 4th Congressional District, Mrs. Margaret Ann Russell. Mrs. Russell, of Lebanon, Missouri, will celebrate her birthday March 22nd surrounded by family and friends; I join them in commending her role as a faithful family servant and community pillar.Born on March 22, 1931 to George T. and Vesta Carr, Margaret grew up rooted in the values of rural America. She graduated from Lebanon High School in Lebanon, Missouri, and went on to attend the historic Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, an institution dedicated since 1833 to the education and cultivation of female leaders.Russell, also of Lebanon, Missouri, who served in the Missouri House of Representatives and the Missouri Senate for almost forty years. She labored diligently to raise their three children Doug, Jeanette, and Melissa. John, Jason, Jordan, Jimmy, Nicole, Makenzie, and Audrey have been blessed to know her as their grandmother; now, Harper and Drew have the special privilege of knowing her as their great grandmother.While prioritizing her family, Mrs. Russell has long been involved in public service as well. She is an active part of the First Baptist Church of Lebanon. She also has encouraged local candidates to pursue public office, has given insight to community leaders, and has worked to strengthen her hometown. Recognizing the key role private citizens can play in protecting children, she consistently supports the Missouri Baptist Children's Home.I applaud Mrs. Russell for her quiet service in support of family and a vibrant local community. The diligent attention she has given to civil society should inspire us all. It is with sincere admiration that I wish her a very happy birthday on this milestone occasion.,2015-03-17 19:10:33.458978,2015-03-17 19:10:33.458978,Extensions,HONORING MRS.

2601,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding citizen of my district. Wilma Buffington Bedell Ball is a cherished resident of Van Buren, Missouri and the State of Missouri. She was born in Great Falls, Montana, on January 5, 1917, and moved to Missouri where she grew up on a farm between Van Buren and Doniphan, Missouri along the Current River.After her education in a one-room schoolhouse in the Ozarks and graduation from Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield, she returned and taught students in that same one-room schoolhouse for three years. After some time away from Missouri, Wilma and her husband, Kelly Ball, returned to Southeast Missouri where she served in the Poplar Bluff School System from 1962 to 1969. There, she discovered her true calling of caring for Missouri's senior citizens. She became a licensed nursing home administrator in 1969 and served as administrator for the Clarks Mountain Nursing Home in Piedmont until 1985. Then, she began working at the Riverways Manor in Van Buren where she still works full-time today. At 94 she is the oldest active nursing home administrator in the United States.Wilma serves our community not only at work, she goes above and beyond through her affiliations with the Methodist Church, Women's Society of Christian Service, Business and Professional Women's Club, Missouri State Teachers Association, and the Missouri Healthcare Association. Even with all of these activities in her life, her number one priority is her family. She has four sons and daughters-in-law, ten grandchildren, and fourteen great-grandchildren. Wilma Buffington Bedell Ball embodies what it means to be a great southeast Missourian. Today we recognize her for her service to our community. ,2015-03-17 19:10:33.646112,2015-03-17 19:10:33.646112,Extensions,RECOGNIZING WILMA BUFFINGTON BEDELL BALL,2011-04-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-01/html/CREC-2011-04-01-pt1-PgE611-3.htm,46,0,157,E611-E612,E000172,mrs. emerson
2602,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I wish to extend my congratulations and best wishes to Dr. Aaron Podolefsky as he prepares to end his tenure as president of the University of Central Missouri, UCM, in Warrensburg, MO. After 5 years of dedicated service to the University, Dr. Podolefsky will become the president of Buffalo State College in Buffalo, New York.After a distinguished record of academic accomplishment as a scholar at San Jose State University in California and the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Dr. Podolefsky pursued a career as an educator and academic administrator, showing a commitment to public universities and the development of young minds across the country.During his tenure as President of UCM, Dr. Podolefsky presided over a period of great change. With the adoption of a new name for the University, he brought together students, educators, community partners, and civic leaders to develop and implement a new vision for UCM. He expanded opportunities for students and enhanced economic development in the region by reorganizing the academic departments and developing partnerships with national and international institutions. Under his leadership, the U.S. News and World Report and Princeton Review have recognized UCM as one of the best universities in the Midwest for the first time in university history. And, UCM provides this exceptional education at low cost, ranking first in the Midwest in low student debt. These accolades, combined with an ever increasing job placement rate for UCM graduates, are evidence of Dr. Podolefsky's sustained commitment to the University.Madam Speaker, I wish Dr. Podolefsky the best of luck in his future career at Buffalo State College and thank him for his dedication to the University of Central Missouri.

2603,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, today I commemorate the work and commitment of the Pujols Family Foundation. We all know Albert Pujols as one of today's most notable baseball players and, of course, the first baseman for my home team, the St. Louis Cardinals. However, in addition to his commitments as a professional athlete, Albert has chosen to invest his time and compassion for the past 5 years in the Pujols Family Foundation. In its efforts to provide education, medical relief, and supplies to impoverished children, the Pujols Family Foundation has funded Haitian disaster relief, family-oriented events in St. Louis, and mission trips to the Dominican Republic. Through their efforts and service, the Pujols Family Foundation has become a saving grace for families living with Down's syndrome, disabilities, and life-threatening illnesses without means to afford many of the necessities we take for granted.Albert Pujols also uses baseball as a way to bring new joy and relief to children in the Dominican Republic. Batey Baseball is a new joint venture for 2010 and is spearheaded by Albert Pujols, the Pujols Family Foundation, and Compassion International. Its mission is to teach responsibility, teamwork, and leadership to young men in the Dominican Republic through the sport of baseball. Set to launch in the summer of 2010, this program will bring joy and hope to many young baseball enthusiasts in the Dominican Republic.It is a welcome occurrence when I have the honor to come before this body and acknowledge the selfless and tireless work done by Missourians on behalf of those less fortunate.On behalf of myself and the people of Missouri, I would like to recognize and congratulate Albert Pujols, his wife Derdre, and the Pujols Family Foundation on their 5 years of service to the people of St. Louis, MO, and the world. ,2015-03-17 19:10:34.132457,2015-03-17 19:10:34.132457,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2010-05-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-05-19/html/CREC-2010-05-19-pt1-PgS3983.htm,76,0,156,S3983,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

2605,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the 10th anniversary of Marian Middle School in St. Louis. Ten years ago, a group of Catholic sisters established Marian Middle School to provide a stable learning environment for economically disadvantaged girls in the St. Louis Public School District.Marian strives to prepare girls in grades 5 through 8 for a college preparatory high school education. Marian Middle School is the only all-girl, private school environment available to students in the St. Louis region. This unique resource offers a learning experience that, just 10 years ago, was unavailable to middle-school-aged girls in St. Louis.Marian Middle School has experienced strong growth since its founding. With a capacity of 80 students, Marian recently relocated to accommodate for its growing enrollment. Marian's resources have also expanded, allowing the school to offer numerous afterschool enrichment programs and activities.Marian strives to provide a challenging curriculum and a balanced range of extracurricular opportunities. The 10-hour school day certainly challenges students, but it also allows Marian to achieve its goal of educating the whole person.True to its call to assist the economically-disadvantaged, Marian determines tuition on a case-by-case basis. Tuition at Marian corresponds with the financial situation of the student's family. This method testifies to the generosity and sincerity of the mission of Marian Middle School.Graduates of Marian Middle School currently attend 10 different college preparatory high schools in St. Louis. On the 10th anniversary of Marian, I think it is appropriate to pay tribute to a unique and successful academic institution.,2015-03-17 19:10:34.543750,2015-03-17 19:10:34.543750,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE MARIAN MIDDLE SCHOOL,2010-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-15/html/CREC-2010-06-15-pt1-PgE1109-3.htm,89,0,156,E1109,C001060,mr. carnahan
2606,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor William Taylor, a Washington area lawyer who played a critical role in civil rights issues across the country. Taylor was instrumental in the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and dedicated over 40 years of his life to ensuring every American, regardless of race or creed, enjoy the freedom that is the promise of this great country.William Taylor was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 4, 1931, to two Jewish immigrants. Though Taylor was subject to racial slurs and discrimination throughout his childhood, he chose to devote his life to guarantee equal rights for all. Taylor understood that the power of the voting booth was vital to liberty, and one's color, religion, social status, and should never restrict access to freedom.Upon his 1954 graduation from Yale Law School, Taylor joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, serving under the great Thurgood Marshall. During his tenure, Taylor aided desegregation enforcement efforts, ensuring school districts abide by the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision.Taylor was then appointed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, composing civil rights recommendations that were the basis for the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. I had the pleasure of working with Bill for a number of years as a member of the Missouri State Senate. During this time, I was witness to his brilliance and perseverance, while we crafted an amicable legislative solution that settled the long-running St. Louis Public School Desegregation issue.

2607,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 150 years of operation by the Missouri Botanical Garden and to congratulate the work of its current president, Dr. Peter H. Raven.The garden was the conception of a successful businessman, Henry Shaw, who moved to Saint Louis in the early nineteenth century to begin his career in the hardware business. His business grew along with the city as he outfitted pioneers, who were heading west into the newly purchased territories. As his wealth grew, Shaw turned his attention to his true passion, horticulture. He established and maintained a personal garden on his estate and on June 15th, 1859, he opened it to the public. Upon his death, Shaw's will established the Missouri Botanical Garden as a charitable trust on the grounds of his estate in south Saint Louis, where it remains to this day.In continuing the vision and passion of its founder, the Missouri Botanical Garden has grown into one of the premier research institutions in the world. Throughout its history, the garden and its staff have contributed significantly to the scientific community, helping to establish a sound base of knowledge in the field of botany.As the oldest continually operating botanical garden in the United States, Missouri Botanical Garden has provided Saint Louisans and visitors from across the globe with the best in horticultural displays. Recently, this homegrown institution received its re-accreditation from the American Association of Museums, the field's primary vehicle for quality assurance. The Missouri Botanical Garden was recognized for its commitment to excellence in all that it does: governance, collections stewardship, public programs, financial stability, high professional standards, and providing the best possible services to the public.Today, 150 years after opening, the Missouri Botanical Garden is a National Historic Landmark and a center for science, conservation, education and horticultural display.I ask that my colleagues join me today in congratulating the Missouri Botanical Garden for its achievements and thanking Dr. Raven for his stewardship of this national treasure.,2015-03-17 19:10:35.034093,2015-03-17 19:10:35.034093,Extensions,COMMEMORATING 150 YEARS OF OPERATION OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN & CONGRATULATING THE WORK OF ITS CURRENT PRESIDENT, DR.

The organization reaches over 9 million students around the world each year, with over 130 local offices in the United States and operations in over 110 countries worldwide. One of the things that makes JA so unique is its use of adult volunteers to bring business to life for students. In the U.S. alone, young people in more than 188,000 classrooms benefit annually from these positive role models.Ms. Jacob is clearly deserving of receiving this year's Flemke Award.She began her career with Junior Achievement in 1987, serving in many roles within the Marketing, Education, Development, and Operation departments until she assumed her current position in 2007. Under her leadership, the area reached 127,000 students in over 700 schools this year, on a $2.7 million budget, making Junior Achievement of Mississippi Valley one of the organization's largest operations in the United States.

House Resolution 917 supports the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week, which will be celebrated this year in just a few days, starting February 17.The National Society of Professional Engineers established the first National Engineers Week in 1951. Through all of the next week, a wide range of activities are planned around the theme of ``Engineers Make a World of Difference'' in order to increase the understanding of and interest in engineering and technology careers and to promote K-12 literacy in math and science. These activities will also highlight the contributions that engineers have made to our society.Historically, Engineers Week is celebrated during the week of George Washington's actual birthday to honor his contributions to engineering as a military engineer and a land surveyor. As our Nation's first President, he put our Nation on the path toward technological advancements, invention and education.We continue down that path today, which has grown exponentially into multiple and complex highways of innovation. It is our engineers, literally and figuratively, who build those highways and help keep us ahead of the innovation curve.

It says:Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shall not be responsible for any payments either directly or indirectly to other housing entities under the Affordable Housing programs unless these GSEs voluntarily provide funding. None of these funds shall be used for soft program costs, including staff costs.In essence, it is a very simple amendment. My concern is that, regardless of what one thinks about the GSEs, it is, I believe, unprecedented for Congress to step in and say: You are a partially privately owned, shareholder-owned entity, and you shall be paying a tax that we determine to a group of other entities over which you have no control.People may like or dislike or want to reform the GSEs. But there are a lot of other GSEs. Are we going to go around and start telling Sallie Mae, for example: You have to fund various of these education programs.There are other quasi-governmental agencies that I think would be very much concerned if Congress started the practice of taking these entities and telling them where they have to spend their funds. This is a backdoor way of avoiding the honest and straightforward provision of either raising the money through taxes or providing other revenue of the Federal Government.I hope my colleagues will consider all three of these amendments. I look forward to discussing them when the time is appropriate. I thank the manager for allowing me to raise these.I call up Amendment No. 4986.,2015-03-17 19:10:36.246955,2015-03-17 19:10:36.246955,Senate,AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008,2008-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-06-19/html/CREC-2008-06-19-pt1-PgS5775.htm,102,51,154,S5775-S5819,B000611,mr. bond

2619,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the accomplishment of Lieutenant Brent Davis of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. After 31 years of service, Lieutenant Davis is retiring, and he leaves a long legacy of honorable service behind.Our first responders are rare people who prize service to others above all else. Highway Patrol officers like Lieutenant Davis put their lives on hold to perform a demanding, stressful job protecting the public. In Missouri, our Highway Patrol officers do more than supervise our highways. They are reliable first responders, they are vigilant in preventing crime, they are essential in our war against illegal drugs. They are also brave, considerate, fair and tough--and no one is a better example of these qualities than Lieutenant Davis.Lieutenant Davis joined the Missouri State Highway Patrol on January 1, 1975, and was stationed at Sikeston after graduating recruit training. On August 1, 1986, he was promoted to corporal and became the assistant zone commander for Zone 6, Sikeston. On August 1, 1989, Davis was promoted to sergeant and moved to Poplar Bluff as a zone sergeant. He worked on the road for 17 years. In September 1992, he became the Public Information Officer. Davis said he really enjoyed the Public Information/Education Officer for Troop E, where he served for 10 years. He was promoted to Lieutenant in September 2002, becoming the enforcement lieutenant for Troop E. In October 2003, Davis became the Special Services Lieutenant, in charge of Drivers Examination, Motor Vehicle Inspection and Commercial Vehicle Inspection Divisions.Congratulations to Lieutenant Davis on his outstanding, selfless accomplishment of 31 years of service through the Missouri Highway Patrol.

I am proud to pay tribute to the years of service and protection provided to the citizens of Missouri by the Highway Patrol.On April 24, 1931, Governor Henry S. Caulfield signed Senate Bill 36, establishing the Missouri State Highway Patrol. The bill provided for a superintendent, 10 captains, and 115 patrolmen, but only 55 men were originally hired as troopers. The first superintendent, Lewis Ellis, was hired on July 21, 1931, and the Missouri State Highway Patrol became effective on September 14, 1931.Throughout its 75 years, the Patrol has provided many invaluable services. In addition to enforcing traffic laws, it encourages traffic safety to the public through displays, speaking engagements, Community Alliance Programs, and the Safety Education Center. The Governor's Security Division, a branch of the Patrol, provides security to Missouri's governor, his family, and visiting dignitaries. Since the Patrol assumed the operation of Missouri's weigh stations in 1942, it has also proven vital to the removal of illegal drugs from the highways.In the last 75 years, Missouri has called upon the Patrol for assistance in periods of civil unrest and natural disaster. In 1954, troopers were called upon to help quell a full-scale prison riot. The Patrol helped Missourians overcome the paralysis caused by the Great Flood of 1993. After Hurricane Katrina, 56 Patrol personnel responded to a call for assistance to Biloxi, Mississippi.Mr. Speaker, the Missouri State Highway Patrol can be proud of all it has done for the State of Missouri.

2622,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chairman, for several years now, the budgets brought before this Congress have not adequately represented the interests of the American people. Rather than approach budgeting in a bipartisan fashion, Republicans have consistently chosen to gild the lily, electing to enact large tax cuts while simultaneously failing to reign in government spending. These actions by today's leaders have passed a tremendous financial burden on to future generations of Americans.The Republicans' Fiscal Year 2007 budget is no better. It makes the deficit worse, offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance, and adds to the growing weight of the national debt. The budget also makes harmful cuts to critical services for working families--including education, veterans' services, and health care.In contrast, the Democratic budget plan proposed by Mr. Spratt of South Carolina would reach balance in 2012, has smaller deficits, accumulates less debt, and repeals the House rule providing for automatic debt ceiling increases. It also would reject the Republican budget's cuts to domestic priorities and reinstate pay-as-you-go rules that helped spur the budget surpluses of the 1990s.I come from Missouri--the ``Show-Me State.'' If the leaders in Congress and at the White House want to be fiscally responsible, they ought to show Missourians and the rest of the American people they mean business by rejecting the failed budget policies of the past and by immediately convening a bipartisan budget summit. President George H.W. Bush did this during a similarly challenging time and America is better for it.,2015-03-17 19:10:38.754744,2015-03-17 19:10:38.754744,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007,2006-05-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-05-17/html/CREC-2006-05-17-pt2-PgH2714-2.htm,61,173,152,H2714-H2753,S000465,mr. skelton

2624,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, Cambodia has adopted international labor rights and standards touted by the International Labor Organization as a model for other developing countries, and they are beginning to flourish. This is a country that has half its population under the age of 20 because of the unbelievable depredations of the Khmer Rouge in the late seventies and widespread murder and genocide. But it is on the right track.However, with the expiration of the bilateral textile agreement, countries such as Cambodia are now losing out in the competition with economies such as China and India. I strongly support and hope we can pass a measure to enhance economic opportunities such as the Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies, or TRADE Act, that will allow least developed countries, such as Cambodia, to remain competitive by enhancing economic growth. They need to create a better investment environment.They are clearly not a Thomas Jefferson democracy yet. They have had a very colorful and very deadly past, but we think that with our help and support, they can redevelop what was once Southeast Asia's rice basket--prior to the Khmer Rouge's destruction of small irrigation infrastructure and the execution of anyone with agricultural expertise--again to a strong contributing economy.We must adopt initiatives such as these for Cambodia and for other countries in the Southeast Asia region. We have to work to continue improving education, emancipation, economic development, and promoting democracy in Southeast Asia, as around the rest of the world.Doing so is not only good neighborly, it will not only help the Southeast Asian nations move toward economic and political reform, but it will be the most important thing we can do against the war that radical Islam has declared upon our world and keep these countries from turning to the extremist violence, the terrorism we now see primarily in the Middle East and have seen too frequently, as noted in ``The Second Front,'' in Southeast Asia.Mr. President, I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:10:39.277115,2015-03-17 19:10:39.277115,Senate,COUP IN THAILAND,2006-09-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-09-20/html/CREC-2006-09-20-pt1-PgS9738-4.htm,118,2,152,S9738-S9739,B000611,mr. bond

2627,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to recognize Colonel John Peabody who has served our Nation's Army with distinction for over 25 years. He will shortly be leaving his current post at the Pentagon and transferring to the State of Hawaii.Colonel Peabody is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. John continued his education through the Command and General Staff College and the Army War College, where he earned his Master's Degree in Strategic Studies. He also has earned degrees from EI Colegio de Mexico and Howard University.Colonel Peabody has field proven leadership capabilities and an exemplary warrior ethos. He was first assigned to the 193rd Infantry Brigade in Panama where he served as a Sapper Platoon Leader, Company Executive Officer, and Aide-de-Camp. Later, he served as the Logistics Support Command Engineer, Somalia. He also was the Political-Military Division Chief of the J5, US Southern Command in Panama. During Operation Iraqi Freedom he commanded the 3rd Infantry Division's Engineer Brigade totaling over 3,000 engineers with ten attached units. Currently, he is assigned to the Army's Office of the Chief, Legislative Liaison, where he is the Programs Division Chief.Colonel Peabody is a model soldier and his many awards and commendations stand as testimony to that. His awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, Purple Heart, Joint Meritorious Service Medal, Army Meritorious Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service and Expeditionary Medals, the Presidential Unit Citation, Master Parachutist Badge, and Ranger Tab.I know that the members of Congress will join me in honoring Colonel John Peabody and wishing his family and him all the best in the years to come.,2015-03-17 19:10:40.011637,2015-03-17 19:10:40.011637,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JOHN PEABODY,2005-06-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-06-20/html/CREC-2005-06-20-pt1-PgE1283-2.htm,82,0,151,E1283,S000465,mr. skelton
2628,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,I thank my colleague, Mr. Speaker, for yielding to me. It is great to join the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Ohio and this 30-Something Group that has really done a fantastic job to help educate Americans about the many challenges that are being faced here and the things we can do about it, the things my colleagues are taking the lead on in this Congress.I wish I could join you in age, I am a 40-something, but I am not far away; and like many people, I had an opportunity to really benefit from the student loan program, as did my wife. Even though I worked my way through college and my family was able to help me some, I still could not have done it without the student loan program.What I am sad to see and really concerned about is these Republican proposals in this budget reconciliation, which is, for those listening, the equivalent of us balancing our checkbook at home to figure out what we can afford and what we cannot. They have proposed the largest cuts to the student loan program in history, in history, of $14 billion. It is a big number. So to really bring it down to the individual student and family, already, even before those cuts, the average student typically has about $17,500 in debt. That is already. Now, on top of that, these proposals would add an additional almost $6,000.Mr. Speaker, this comes at a time when we really need to be expanding opportunity and at a time when we really need to be opening up access to higher education. We all know in our country that is the road to opportunity.,2015-03-17 19:10:40.165746,2015-03-17 19:10:40.165746,House,30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP,2005-11-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-11-08/html/CREC-2005-11-08-pt1-PgH10023-3.htm,147,8,151,H10023-H10029,C001060,mr. carnahan
2629,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Judy Bentley, the President and CEO of Community Health-in Partnership Services (CHIPS) in St. Louis. Ms. Bentley was recently selected as a 2004 Robert Wood Johnson Community Health Leader. She was one of just ten people nationally to be selected for this prestigious award, which includes a grant of over $105,000 to enhance her work.A nurse practitioner and native of St. Louis, Ms. Bentley was inspired to enter the healthcare field after her diagnosis of uterine cancer in 1975.Ms. Bentley founded CHIPS in 1990, and it remains the only free health clinic serving the mostly uninsured residents of north St. Louis. In its first year, CHIPS served about 250 clients in its meager facility in the basement of a local church. In 1991, the clinic moved to a new 5,600-square-foot facility. Currently run by a staff of 10 full and parttime employees, along with a core of 19 volunteer professionals, CHIPS provides health screenings and primary-level health care to about 1,000 clients a month through both its outreach and in facility services.Ms. Bentley has also implemented a unique outreach program to provide prevention and health education in non-traditional community settings including banks, grocery stores, beauty salons, barbershops, and homeless centers. Ms. Bentley also promotes workforce development by hiring and training lay health educators to go door-to-door, enrolling clients, and has implemented an intergenerational program in which teens in the youth development program work with senior citizens.Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Ms. Bentley for this national award, and express my gratitude for her determination and leadership. Her work among the medically underserved has undoubtedly inspired many others in St. Louis and elsewhere to take action. It is an honor to recognize her today for her important work and this well deserved award.,2015-03-17 19:10:40.422930,2015-03-17 19:10:40.422930,Extensions,HONORING JUDY BENTLEY,2004-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-06-15/html/CREC-2004-06-15-pt1-PgE1121-3.htm,82,0,150,E1121,C001049,mr. clay

2631,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Fire Chief Steve Paulsell who for the past 25 years has been Chief of the Fire District in Boone County, MO. When Mr. Paulsell became Fire Chief in 1997, the fire department was volunteer and consisted of six stations and 50 firefighters. Under Chief Paulsell's supervision, the fire district has become a national leader in fire and emergency service. Chief Paulsell's departmental accomplishments include: growth from six to fourteen fire stations in 2003, over 300 volunteer personnel, creation of one of 28 Federal Emergency Management Agency urban search and rescue task forces, an FBI accredited bomb squad, award-winning elementary school education life safety program, creation of fire and building codes in Boone County, and original creator of the Joint Communications 911 Center. Chief Paulsell's personal accomplishments include: International Association of Fire Chief's Fire Chief of the Year in 1996, chair of the Missouri Fire Service Alliance, National Fire Academy course developer, and developer of Missouri State Fire Mutual Aid system. In addition to these accomplishments, Mr. Paulsell has testified on behalf of the Nation's fire service to the Senate.Boone County Fire District Board President Willis Smith praises Chief Paulsell and states, ``He was the right man to lead our fire department in 1977 and he is still the right man to lead. He has the vision, insight and leadership abilities to continue to grow this department.'' I commend Boone County Fire Chief Steve Paulsell for his dedicated service to protecting and improving the quality of fire and emergency services for Missourians, and for making the Boone County Fire District a model for our country. ,2015-03-17 19:10:40.900262,2015-03-17 19:10:40.900262,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2003-03-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-03-06/html/CREC-2003-03-06-pt1-PgS3247-2.htm,36,0,149,S3247,B000611,mr. bond
2632,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the 75th anniversary of Vashon High School. In the early quarter of the 20th century, the high school that most African-American students attended in St. Louis was overcrowded and quite a distance from their homes. Consequently, in 1922, a citizens group called the Central School Patron Association led by Reverend George Stevens and other community alliances began formulating plans for a second high school designated for African-American students. On September 6, 1927, Vashon High School opened and has been educating and changing the lives of students since. Over time, Vashon High School has established itself as a premier educational institute, known for its athletics as well as academics.There are several outstanding individuals who have contributed to the founding and success of Vashon High School. The school was named for a family with a long tradition of struggle and sacrifice dedicated to the importance of education while battling to secure civil and human rights for African-Americans. Specifically, the school was named for George B. Vashon, 1824-1878, the first African-American graduate of Oberlin College, OH in 1844, and his son John B. Vashon, 1859-1924, an outstanding educator in the city of St. Louis for 34 years, James W. Meyers served as the first principal of Vashon from 1927-1932 and Otto Bohanan, a member of the faculty, composed the school song, ``Vashon We Love''. Many students honed their talents, skills, and abilities to become future educators and community leaders from the positive influence and support of these and other influential faculty members.Over the past 75 years, Vashon High School has undergone changes and relocated to several different locations, but irrespective of physical location, the spirit of Vashon High School continues to inspire students to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals. Congratulations to the students, faculty, and alumni of Vashon High School. ,2015-03-17 19:10:41.123422,2015-03-17 19:10:41.123422,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2002-11-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-11-15/html/CREC-2002-11-15-pt1-PgS11209.htm,148,0,148,S11209,B000611,mr. bond

2634,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with pride that I announce that Scholastic Incorporated, of Jefferson City, Missouri, has been named Missouri Industry of the Year. Scholastic is Jefferson City's largest private employer.Scholastic, which ships paperback books to students throughout the nation, was recognized at Missouri Industry Day. Missouri Industry Day was designed to help young people, legislators and the general public become more aware of the role of business and industry in Missouri's state economy. Criteria for the award include use of company resources to contribute to a municipality where the company is located, showing entrepreneurial spirit in the community and providing innovative leadership relating to products or services.Scholastic excelled in all of these areas. They created an additional 1500 new jobs in Missouri, employing a total of 3000 Missourians. Scholastic offered on-site training programs for employees including English As a Second Language, GED classes and computer application classes. Scholastic employees are also eligible for 50 percent tuition reimbursement for post-high school education. Employees of Scholastic are involved in locals Chambers of Commerce, March of Dimes, United Way and other organizations.Scholastic and the Missouri General Assembly collaborated for the ``Missouri Reads'' program. An initiative where legislators read to students and the students receive a free copy of the book. So far Scholastic has donated over 80,000 to Missouri's children.Mr. Speaker, Scholastic Inc., of Jefferson City, Missouri, has been an example to industry throughout Missouri and the Nation.

2635,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill I call the ``The Homefront Medical Preparedness Act.''In the past century we have witnessed unprecedented advances in science, technology and medicine and have seen limitless potential to improve the human condition, cure disease, and advance human health in ways that were once unimaginable. Yet, at the same time we have seen some of these very advances have spawned new threats, threats that were simply inconceivable 100 years ago. The recent outbreaks of anthrax in Florida, New York City, and Washington, DC, coupled with the terrorist attack of September 11 have brought to light the compelling need to properly prepare our communities for the threat of bioterrorists attacks.A strong public-health infrastructure is the best defense against any bioterrorism attack. As a Nation we remain highly vulnerable, not because we are unprepared, but because we are under-prepared. The Department of Health and Human Services has made tremendous advances over the past few years. However, while significant progress has been made, there are still large gaps in our current approach. Our goal must be to eliminate these gaps and reduce the risk to our Nation and our communities. As a nation, we must prepare our communities, and improve our capacity to respond. Central to an effective response to a bioterrorist attack are detection, treatment and containment of a disease epidemic and our Nation's public-health system is on the front line in this effort.The Nation's public health system is a complex network of people, systems, and organizations working at the local, State and national levels. The Nation is served by more then 3,000 county and city health departments, more than 3,000 local boards of health, 59 State and territorial-health departments, tribal-health departments more than 160,000 public and private laboratories. Current estimates suggest that the public-health workforce includes 500,000 professionals employed at the local, State and national levels. According to the Health Resource and Services Administration in 1989 only 44 percent of these 500,000 workers had formal, academic training in public health and those with graduate public health degrees were an even smaller fraction. As of 1997, 78 percent of local health departments executives did not have graduate degrees in public health. Changes on the public health system have brought new demands on the workforce and identified a need for additional training and education. Many public-health workers do not have the necessary skills and knowledge base to meet the needs of the emerging public-health system and public-health threats. These statistics highlight the critical need to provide these professionals with the most up-to-date training, technology, and tools necessary to meet the increasing demands and emerging needs.An important first step has already been taken. The Centers for Disease Control has created Centers for Public Health Preparedness across the country. There are currently 14 centers total: 7 Academic Centers, 4 Speciality Centers, and 3 Local Exemplar Centers. The Academic Centers link schools of public health, State and local-health agencies and other academic and community health partners to foster individual preparedness on the front line. The Speciality Centers focus on a topic, professional discipline, core public-health competency, practice setting or application of learning technology. And finally, the Local Exemplar Centers develop advanced applications at the community level in three areas of key importance to preparedness for bioterrorism and other urgent health threats: integrated communications and information systems across multiple sectors; advanced operational readiness assessment; and comprehensive training and evaluation.In Missouri we are fortunate to have not one, but two centers in St. Louis at St. Louis University School of Public Health: an Academic Center the Heartland Center for Public Health Preparedness as well as a Speciality Center The Center for the Study of Bioterrorism and Emerging Threats. The School of Public Health at St. Louis University has clearly been on the forefront of this issue. I was honored to have secured Federal appropriations dollars necessary for startup costs for the Center for the Study of Bioterrorism, the only specialty center with a primary focus on bioterrorism in the country. The center provides public-healthcare providers and healthcare facilities with the tools needed for preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation of intentional or naturally occurring outbreaks. Under the leadership of Dr. Evans, the center has developed training curriculum that is being used nationwide to train healthcare providers and public-health departments. In fact, the center's training materials were used by the CDC to train emergency health personal, healthcare providers and other public-health workers in New York to respond to the September 11 attack.But more can and must be done. Today I introduced legislation which will expand the national network of Centers of Public Health Preparedness by adding new centers across the country as well as funneling more valuable resources to existing centers to meet urgent, public-health training needs. This bill will authorize $50 million and would instruct the Director of the Centers for Disease Control to establish a national network of Centers for Public Health Preparedness utilizing the existing Centers for Public Health Preparedness Program to train and to prepare the national public-health workforce, healthcare providers and the general public to respond to bioterrorist threats.Each center, housed at an accredited school of public health will 1. provide training and education to local and state health department staff, emergency first responders, and primary and acute care providers on the best practices necessary to protect against, and respond to the array of potential threats facing the American public, including bioterrorism, infectious disease and weapons of mass destruction; 2. provide information to healthcare [providers and other components of the healthcare industry to protect against and respond to the threat of bioterrorism, infectious disease and weapons of mass destruction; and 3. provide information and education on relevant bioterrorist threats to the public.Under my legislation each center, both new and existing, will receive at least $1 million per year, but may receive additional sums per year if the CDC deems additional resources are necessary to carry out regional or national training activities at a particular center.

2636,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I have a few concluding remarks.First, I want to amplify a point that my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), made regarding the situation regarding the computer systems.The point is that as educational institutions begin to raise some concerns that these new reporting requirements would require their schools to completely revamp their computer systems at a substantial cost, these institutions noted that complying with the law's requirement to report tuition payments received would be difficult, and that because schools keep a running total of the payments that they receive from students, in other words, payments are not applied separately to tuition, but instead are applied to a student's total outstanding balance that may include room and board, books, student fees for recreational activities, or other costs, and, moreover, payments are not applied to any particular academic year. As a result, these institutions would have had to change their accounting and computer systems dramatically to make them compatible with reporting requirements. We have undertaken, instead, a change in those reporting requirements so those colleges and universities will not have to undertake that substantial cost.As a final comment, I would just advise my colleagues that in the 1999 calendar year, the Hope scholarship credit was claimed by 3,334,000 students; the lifetime learning tax credit was claimed for 3,575,000 college students.Clearly, the work we have done here in Congress back in 1997 has taken a large step forward as far as making higher education more affordable. I think we are taking an additional step forward for the administrators of these colleges and universities by reducing their burden.,2015-03-17 19:10:41.992039,2015-03-17 19:10:41.992039,House,AMENDING INTERNAL REVENUE CODE TO SIMPLIFY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS,2001-12-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-12-04/html/CREC-2001-12-04-pt1-PgH8801.htm,166,12,147,H8801-H8803,H000948,mr. hulshof
2637,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule, because it limits the opportunity for Members to have a fair and open debate on a pocketbook issue affecting millions of workers.First, it denies us an opportunity to offer a Democratic substitute that would phase in a $1 increase over a 2-year period. This parliamentary maneuver bars Members from debating and amending provisions of the bill that repeal overtime pay for millions of employees working in computers, sales, and funeral services.This maneuver is even more insulting to Members of this body because the effect of these overtime provisions were never considered in this Congress by the Committee on Education and the Workforce, or evaluated by expert witnesses to determine what impact they may have on the work force.Second, Mr. Speaker, the rule automatically includes the DeMint amendment, which will destroy the concept of a Federal minimum wage by allowing 50 States to enact 50 different Federal minimum wage provisions.What a disaster, Mr. Speaker. What an administrative nightmare: fifty States, some of them competing against each other to see who can reduce their State's minimum wage to a level as close to Mexico's and other Nations that exploit their workers.Mr. Speaker, this House should not be in the business of relegating our workers to slave wages in order to compete with cruel, insensitive economic systems of Third World countries. This rule should be opposed because it abuses the House rules, because it violates fair play, and because it stacks the deck against American workers.

2638,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's comments and candor on this issue.Last year I introduced S. 758, the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act in response to two Supreme Court rulings urging Congress to act on national legislation that would fairly and efficiently compensate victims of asbestos. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter wrote for the court in Ortiz versus Fibreboard: ``The elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary judicial administration and calls for national legislation . . . to date Congress has not responded.''It was my hope that this bill could serve to bring all parties together to solve this issue. It is now clear, however, that this bill will not move in its current form. As I mentioned to the majority leader, the consensus regarding S. 758 between industry, the plaintiffs, and other concerned parties, and among industry itself, appears to have deteriorated substantially since S. 758 was introduced.It is also clear that there is virtually no time in the Senate to consider this bill this year. The Senate has a target adjournment date of October 6 this year. Before adjourning, the Senate will work to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the marriage tax penalty, pass agriculture sanctions reform to open markets for American farmers and ranchers, timely pass the budget and 13 separate appropriations bills, reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, give final approval to legislation to combat the methamphetamine crisis, and adopt legislation to protect Social Security. These issues will take up my time this year. And these issues are just a partial list of the ambitious agenda for the year.In light of this situation, and the fact that the House appears to be taking a different approach entirely, I appreciate the majority leader's candid assessment of the legislative prospects for this bill. Because it serves no purpose to represent that S. 758 will pass or be acted upon this year or in the future, I appreciate the remarks of the majority leader.,2015-03-17 19:10:42.478390,2015-03-17 19:10:42.478390,Senate,FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS COMPENSATION ACT,2000-04-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-04-04/html/CREC-2000-04-04-pt1-PgS2097-2.htm,40,1,146,S2097-S2098,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2639,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.Once again the Republican majority is running roughshod over House procedures. The resolution before us today was never considered by the Committee on Education and the Workforce. It was rushed to the floor to produce sound bites for the 6 o'clock news.This resolution focuses on the child care needs of at-home parents, parents that, as the resolution states, have foregone a second income to stay at home with their children. Certainly the issue is worthy of discussion, however it ignores the great needs of working families where both parents work, it ignores the need to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act, and it ignores parents who are transitioning from welfare to work.If this resolution were fair, it would reflect the priorities of working parents as well as the at-home parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the majority's abuse of the legislative process bars us from having this discussion today.Last Congress, Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority voted to cut Head Start, to cut child nutrition programs and to eliminate the school lunch program. The Republican majority on our committee last Congress actually voted to cut child care by $2.5 billion, despite the chairman's boasts of the Republican accomplishments in the field of child care.Mr. Speaker, now the Republican majority offers only empty resolutions instead of real solutions to the Nation's child care needs. Instead of just passing resolutions, this Congress should be acting to ensure that all children, including those children whose parents must work, receive affordable, high quality day-care. Instead of passing empty resolutions, we should be taking up President Clinton's call for investing $21 billion in helping all Americans meet the challenge of raising a family.,2015-03-17 19:10:42.710555,2015-03-17 19:10:42.710555,House,DAYCARE FAIRNESS FOR STAY-AT-HOME PARENTS,1998-02-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-11/html/CREC-1998-02-11-pt1-PgH395-2.htm,10,9,144,H395-H402,C000488,mr. clay
2640,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it pains me to talk about the situation in which we find ourselves. Our colleague from New York pointed out a few moments ago the underfunding of the defense budget, and I agree; of our overcommitting our troops, and I agree. But that is not the issue before us today.The issue before us today is whether we truly recognize an emergency, as has been so recognized by the White House and has been so recognized by the Senate, or whether this is to be an offset against other items in the budget.The rule before us authorizes us to take up a bill that allows offsets. I think, Mr. Speaker, that is a mistake. This is a matter of process. It is a matter of doing it right. Though 80 percent of the bill's appropriations are for military programs, all of the measures are offsets in the domestic programs. I think there should be no offsets, whether they come from the military or whether they come from the domestic.This is an emergency. We do not plan on hurricanes. We do not plan on tornadoes. We do not plan on floods. We do not plan on those international crises, such as Bosnia and Iraq. And yet, this is not treated as an emergency.This bill rescinds money from the low-income rental housing assistance, from the airport program, from the National Community Service Program, from bilingual education. Should this bill pass in this forum, it is a sure invitation for a presidential veto, an invitation that I am sure will not be refused.,2015-03-17 19:10:42.966738,2015-03-17 19:10:42.966738,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3579, EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998,1998-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-31/html/CREC-1998-03-31-pt1-PgH1786-7.htm,39,28,144,H1786-H1797,S000465,mr. skelton
2641,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I take this opportunity to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant and teacher, Pamela May, who recently passed away at the age of 44.Pam May, who was born August 4, 1953, in Nevada, MO, dedicated her life to public service and education. In 1997, she was appointed the Camden County auditor by Gov. Mel Carnahan, and from 1992 to 1997 Pam served as the Camdenton Third Ward Alderman. She also served as a Camden County Commissioner.Mrs. May also served on the Child Advocacy Council, the Citizens Advisory Committee for the Camden County Jail, and the Governor's Total Transportation Committee. She was a member of the Camdenton Rotary Club and was former president of the Camdenton Chamber of Commerce.In addition to her public service contributions, Pam May devoted her life to teaching Missouri youngsters. She was a teacher for 10 years in the Camdenton School District, and she began working in the Parents as Teachers program in 1986-87. She was also a part-time teacher in the Lake Area Vocational School's Child Care Management program. Mrs. May later became child care coordinator for the Camdenton R-3 School District, and wrote a grant to open the district's child care center.Pam May is survived by her husband, Ralph, two sons, a daughter, her parents, a brother, and two sisters.Mr. Speaker, I am certain that the Members of the House will join me in celebrating the life of this great Missouri public servant and educator. Pamela May's strong sense of community and compassion for the youth of our country make her a role model for all Americans. We will truly miss her.,2015-03-17 19:10:43.199903,2015-03-17 19:10:43.199903,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF PAMELA MAY,1998-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-23/html/CREC-1998-04-23-pt1-PgE655.htm,46,0,144,E655,S000465,mr. skelton
2642,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, every year in St. Louis, Missouri, May Day is especially important in paying tribute to what can be achieved through collective action. This year, the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center, as well as, the St. Louis African American community will celebrate May Day on May 17. The first of these celebrations occurred more than eighty years ago and since that time they have continually grown. The celebration serves as a reminder of all that has been endured and the prosperity that it now reflects.Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center began its service more than 100 years ago. Its predecessor was the St. Louis Colored Orphans' Home and was established in 1888 by a group of prominent women concerned about the welfare of neglected and orphaned children. The president of the Board of Directors from 1919 to 1943 was Annie Malone. In honor of her loyalty and dedication to the goals of the institution, it was renamed for her in 1946. Through the years, the Center has continued to expand its services and programs to meet the needs of a changing society, but the mission, ``to improve the quality of life for children, families, and the community utilizing education, social services, and developing positive values and self esteem,'' has remained the same.Annie M's has several programs including residential treatment, therapeutic services/family crisis center and its evaluation and diagnostic services. The programs have helped to make the quality of life more complete, fulfilling and successful for African Americans in the St. Louis Community. I salute the contributions made by Annie M's beneficial programs and join the community in paying tribute to the woman that helped in their growth and success, Annie Malone. ,2015-03-17 19:10:43.525128,2015-03-17 19:10:43.525128,Senate,TRIBUTE TO ANNIE MALONE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTER,1998-05-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-05/html/CREC-1998-05-05-pt1-PgS4371-2.htm,54,0,144,S4371,B000611,mr. bond
2643,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 4250. This bill is nothing more than a cynical propaganda effort promoted by the Republican leadership to convince the public that they are doing something about the abuse of HMOs. This bill is loaded with special interest provisions that do far more harm than good to consumers of health care.The Republican bill includes a provision to establish Association Health Plans that would enable small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together and purchase health insurance coverage. The chairman of our Committee on Education and the Workforce has stated that the committee has approved this provision and so no one should be concerned about it. The fact is, the bill was reported over Democrat's vehement objections, because it is clear that the arrangements will do more harm than good.The National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislators join with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in stating that Association Health Plans would undermine positive state regulatory reforms already in place, would destroy important consumer protections, and would contribute to the collapse of small group health insurance in many states.According to CBO, Association Health Plans would increase the risk of health plan failure and would disrupt the insurance market, because Federal regulatory standards would probably be less strict than the state standards that apply under current law. Association Health Plans would present state regulations covering such vital matters as sovereignty, mandated care and the policing of fraud and abuse.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 4250 and instead support H.R. 3605, the bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights act.,2015-03-17 19:10:43.759301,2015-03-17 19:10:43.759301,House,PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1998,1998-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-24/html/CREC-1998-07-24-pt1-PgH6297-6.htm,101,78,144,H6297-H6395,C000488,mr. clay
2644,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary citizen who has given much to his community. Mr. John Forthman, who resides in Lilbourn, MO, in my congressional district, is an exceptional individual and a role model to every American.Mr. Forthman has worked with the New Madrid County Civil Defense for 9 years. His services have included storm spotting, emergency organization, and disaster relief. In 1992, he obtained his EMT license in order to better respond to medical emergencies within the community. Since then, he has been working with the New Madrid County ambulance service and attending continuing education classes in emergency medicine. He has also been a volunteer firefighter for the city of Lilbourn for over 8 years. For the last 2 years, he has filled the position of fire chief, playing an integral role in building a much-needed fire station for his hometown of Lilbourn.Mr. Forthman's service to the community doesn't stop there; he is also a reserve deputy for the New Madrid County Sheriff's Department. He is a commissioned deputy and works to assist the full-time officers to prevent crime in the area.It would seem that with these numerous activities, Mr. Forthman would have time for nothing else. Yet, he is involved in the area Little League and various high school athletics and works full time for the Electric Cooperative New Madrid Powerplant, where he has been for the last 20 years. He also spends much time with his wife and two children.Citizens such as Mr. Forthman are unfortunately few and far between. The people of Lilbourn are lucky to know John Forthman, and I am proud to recognize him for his many achievements.,2015-03-17 19:10:43.980458,2015-03-17 19:10:43.980458,Extensions,JOHN FORTHMAN: A COMMUNITY HERO,1997-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-23/html/CREC-1997-04-23-pt1-PgE717-2.htm,49,0,143,E717,E000172,mrs. emerson
2645,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, this week there is much discussion, there is much speculation about the negotiations that are ongoing between the President and congressional leaders in the House and Senate. Hanging in the balance, Mr. Speaker, are the prospects of a bipartisan balanced budget plan. Hanging in the balance are the prospects of staving off the impending bankruptcy for Medicare, our health care system for senior citizens. And hanging in the balance through these negotiations are the prospects for permanent tax relief for men and women all across this country, essentially whether or not we want to let moms and dads across this great land keep more of what they earn.With the recent debate, Mr. Speaker, about tax relief centering more and more around detailed numbers and percentages and Treasury Department calculations, perhaps I should say Treasury Department miscalculations, it is easy to lose sight of what our tax relief package is all about, what it means to working families who have not had tax relief in nearly two decades.I know that I am but a single voice crying out on behalf of hard-working men and women across this country, but I hope to include the pleas and the statements of those who came to Capitol Hill. Some working mothers in fact who came to Capitol Hill this month who quickly reminded us, gave us a reality check that tax relief is more than just abstract numbers. It is about take-home pay. It is about purchasing power. It is about freedom to make choices in raising a family.For example, it is about Debra from Dale City, VA. Debra is the divorced mother of a 17-year-old, an 11-year-old and a 10-year-old. Keeping more of her money means being able to help her three children reach their dreams. The dream of Debra's college-bound daughter is to attend college and become a doctor. For Debra's middle daughter, she aspires to be a teacher. And although Debra is determined to help bring her daughters' dreams to fulfillment, it is not going to be an easy task.Mr. Speaker, the House-passed version of the Taxpayer Relief Act a couple of weeks ago will make things a little bit easier for Debra and for her family. With the child and the education tax credits, for instance, Debra will get to keep more of what she earns, making it easier to send her kids to college and to fulfill their dreams. In fact, just with the child tax credit, the Republican version of the child tax credit, in calendar year 1998 Debra will get to keep $800 more of her own money next year and $1,000 more in the following years. She can save for her kids' education, putting money way in a dream savings account.Our House plan also allows Debra to participate in education initiatives like the education credit for college deduction which helps defray the expenses, the out-of-pocket expenses for Debra's college age or college bound kids for tuition, for books and for fees.That is what this tax relief is about. It is not about numbers; it is about real people. It is about Don and Carnetta from my home town of Columbia. Don and Carnetta are both in their senior years. Don recently retired from a career at Wal-Mart. Part of the compensation package that Don had during his career at Wal-Mart was that he was given shares of Wal-Mart stock as incentive to build for his pension, to put his nest egg away for he and Carnetta. He fervently hopes, anxiously is awaiting whether or not the President will sign our tax package into law because what it means to 2 million seniors that are in the 15-percent income tax bracket across this country is a capital gains cut from the 28-percent margin all the way down to 10 percent, if the President would enact and sign into law this much-needed relief effort. It is not about numbers. It is about people.I happened to receive a letter in the last 2 weeks that I want to paraphrase just a bit, Mr. Speaker, if I can. It says, ``Dear Mr. Hulshof, I am a star-ranked scout in Troop 50. I will be a 7th grader at St. Peter's in Fulton, MO. I am 12 years old. I am in favor of the tax cut,'' says Michael, ``because if taxes are cut, people will have more money. When they have more money, they spend or invest more. Then if they spend more,'' Michael writes, ``more needs to be produced. This increased demand means more people are needed to produce and then employment goes up. Increased employment means people are working more and paying more taxes which increases revenue to the Government, which means fewer people collect entitlements from the government resulting in less expense to Government.''Michael goes on to write, keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, Michael is a 7th grader, 12 years old at St. Peter's in Fulton, MO. Michael says, ``Every time I hear the Democrats or certain members of the press talk about tax cuts, they say, how will the Government pay for the tax cut? But they never ask how the employed taxpayers are going to pay for the tax increases. Thank you for all the hard work you do. Thanks for considering my input.'' Signed, Michael.Well, Mr. Speaker, I think sometimes suffer ye unto the little children and out of the mouths of babes sometimes come pretty poignant points. I think Michael has somehow grasped something that we here in Washington from time to time forget. It is not our money. It is the American people's money. We are not giving it back to them. We are letting people keep it in the first place.For instance, in my congressional district, in the 9th Congressional District of Missouri, if the President will sign into law the Republican-passed tax relief package, the child credit alone, there are 84,000 children in the 9th Congressional District of Missouri whose parents will qualify for the $500 per child tax credit. What that means is nearly $39 million get to stay in the 9th District of Missouri and do not have to be collected by the Government and sent here to Washington where oftentimes we spend it very unwisely. This is just one way that this tax relief package will help all Americans. It is not about numbers. It is about people.I see my friend and colleague from Missouri, from the 7th Congressional District of Missouri, is in the well of the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Blunt].,2015-03-17 19:10:44.114554,2015-03-17 19:10:44.114554,House,THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN,1997-07-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-07-16/html/CREC-1997-07-16-pt1-PgH5386-5.htm,101,1,143,H5386-H5393,H000948,mr. hulshof
2646,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly recognize the Mingo Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center in Puxico, MO.The Mingo Job Corps Center was established in 1965 as a vocational/educational training center for disadvantaged youth. Since that time it has served hundreds of at-risk youth and its surrounding communities. The students complete their secondary educations and learn employable skills while working on needed community projects. At the Mingo Center, student volunteer services proved to be key components to such important projects as excavation work at the Three Rivers Community College in Poplar Bluff, MO, the elevation of flood-prone Highway D in Wayne County, MO, and the restoration of several untended cemeteries throughout the region.While the students are obtaining an education and helping local communities, they are also learning vocational trades that earn them jobs. Those factors are very significant and the Mingo Job Corps Center has an excellent and an improving record of graduating students with GED's and placement in jobs. It is as rewarding for me as it was for my late husband, Bill Emerson, to observe the progress of the corpsmen as they enter and eventually complete the program and become hard-working contributors to their communities. The ultimate prize, however, belongs to the dedicated young corpsmen who endeavor to build their own future through the personal commitment they each make toward completing the Job Corps experience.In closing, I also would like to express my appreciation to the staff at the Mingo Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center for their dedicated work and to the past and present corpsmen for their decision to work for a better life for themselves, their families, and their community.,2015-03-17 19:10:44.355725,2015-03-17 19:10:44.355725,Extensions,MINGO JOBS CORPS CENTER,1997-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-04/html/CREC-1997-09-04-pt1-PgE1660.htm,115,0,143,E1660,E000172,mrs. emerson
2647,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the achievement of Mr. Donald J. Babb of my home State of Missouri. Mr. Babb recently received the Shirley Anne Munroe Leadership Development Award from the American Hospital Association and the Hospital Research and Education Trust. Mr. Babb is the chief executive officer of the Citizens Memorial Hospital and the executive director of Citizens Memorial Health Care Foundation in Bolivar, MO. The national award recognizes leaders in executive management positions in small or rural hospitals who have improved health care delivery to rural areas through innovative and progressive steps.Donald has been an instrumental part of the Citizens Memorial Hospital since before its opening in 1982. Under his leadership, the hospital was recognized as one of the ``Top Ten Small Rural Hospitals'' in the Nation, as determined by the American Hospital Association, and has become a fully integrated health care delivery system. Mr. Babb stated that, ``Meeting the needs of the communities we serve has been my No. 1 priority. We have expanded services so that patients have access to quality care for every stage of their lives.'' His dedication to the good health of the people in rural southwest Missouri is obvious through his efforts directed toward improving the quality of health care available in this area.For the past 17 years, Mr. Babb has dedicated his life to the betterment of his community and the people he serves. His work embodies the spirit of the American dream. Mr. President, I ask that Members of the Senate join me in recognizing and honoring the work and lifetime achievements of Mr. Donald J.

2648,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, as you know, October 5 through October 11 is National Fire Prevention Week. Today I want to take time out to recognize the firefighters back home in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District. While there are many local fire departments who demonstrate excellence within the community, one shining example is the Palmyra volunteer fire department.Celebrating its 100th anniversary, the eighteen members of the Palmyra volunteer fire department received an award earlier this year, naming it the top fire department in the entire State of Missouri.While they fight fires with the best of them, they truly are public servants. Nominated because of the community service performed by its members, the Palmyra fire department enjoys wide support from the local residents.Fire Chief Chuck Hoehne, a 30-year veteran of the department, said it well, ``Everything we do, the community is behind us. They support us 100 percent.'' Mr. Speaker, that is easy to believe once you learn more about the group.When the team is not busy with their jobs, such as bank managers, sales clerks, construction workers, and insurance salesmen, they are out in Palmyra educating residents about the importance of fire safety. They make trips to all the schools with the Stay Alive House, a model used to teach people how to escape from a burning building. Students also are invited to tour the fire station.Due in large part to the education provided by this exceptional team, I am pleased to report that fires are on the decrease in Palmyra--something to celebrate during National Fire Prevention Week.Congratulations are in order for the Palmyra fire department, making northeastern Missouri a safer place to live.,2015-03-17 19:10:44.877088,2015-03-17 19:10:44.877088,Extensions,NATIONAL FIRE PREVENTION WEEK,1997-10-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-10-09/html/CREC-1997-10-09-pt1-PgE2006.htm,140,0,143,E2006,H000948,mr. hulshof
2649,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hollings amendment. The amendment includes $62 million for EPA's environmental technology initiative, a program which the conference agreement on the VA-HUD bill sought to reduce funding for, in order to fund higher priority EPA programs.During consideration of the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD bill last fall, not a single member raised concerns about the reduction to this program in the committee markup, on the floor, or in conference on the legislation.This program was initiated by President Clinton 3 years ago, and a total of $100 million has been appropriated for the first 2 years. What has the program accomplished? Not a whole lot as far as I can tell.We have funded energy efficient housing conferences, lighting research centers' education of electric utilities about the benefits of energy efficient lighting, and marketing programs to increase the purchase of energy efficient lighting products.Mr. President, what the environmental technology program has amounted to is corporate pork. Mr. President, we cannot afford this sort of corporate subsidy.These sort of activities are not geared to ensuring the U.S. gains a strong foothold in the market for environmental technology, as the administration has claimed.I should also add that the budget request for this program has quadrupled from $30 million in fiscal year 1994 to $127 million in fiscal year 1996. Much of that funding has been passed through from EPA to other agencies--NIST, DOE, agencies which have their own budgets for technology activities. This, at a time when the administration claims it cannot find funds to set drinking water standards for cryptosporidium or control toxic water pollutants.Given the importance of ensuring that EPA's limited resources are spent on those activities resulting in the most direct and significant gains to environmental protection, additional funding for this program above the $10 million available in this bill is not acceptable.,2015-03-17 19:10:45.165299,2015-03-17 19:10:45.165299,Senate,BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II,1996-03-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-12/html/CREC-1996-03-12-pt1-PgS1816.htm,33,70,142,S1816-S1852,B000611,mr. bond
2650,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to join all of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--as we welcome the newest Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Earl Blumenauer of Portland, OR. As we all know, Earl comes to Congress with big shoes to fill. He's following in the footsteps of our former colleague, Ron Wyden, now the junior Senator from Oregon. For 15 years, Ron devoted himself to the people of Portland. His service and effectiveness will certainly be missed in the people's House.But I think the people of the Third District of Oregon have chosen a remarkable replacement in Earl Blumenauer--for they have chosen a man who has spent his entire life building his community, and bringing Portland's common sense to Portland's problems.Earl had a passion for public policy at a very young age, testifying before Congress while he was still a college student. And after finishing school and working briefly in education, Earl became the youngest person ever elected to the Oregon Legislature, at 23 years old.After three terms in his State's legislature, two as county commissioner, and three more on Portland's City Council, Earl has shown that his dedication to local solutions could have a national impact.He's already recognized as a leader on urban environment and transportation policies. He's been a champion of reasonable, thoughtful land use; aggressive recycling; and the kind of light rail that has worked so well throughout the Portland region.No wonder Earl won the support of prominent Republicans as well as Democrats in his election bid.So I'm delighted to welcome him to Congress--to serve the people of Portland, and all Americans. I expect that his vision and values will contribute a great deal to our debates, and to the Nation's problems.,2015-03-17 19:10:45.299389,2015-03-17 19:10:45.299389,House,WELCOMING THE HONORABLE EARL BLUMENAUER TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,1996-05-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-30/html/CREC-1996-05-30-pt1-PgH5650-5.htm,77,2,142,H5650-H5651,G000132,mr. gephardt
2651,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support of one of our Nation's greatest success stories for our youth, the AmeriCorps program, and to express my opposition to amendments offered today which would eliminate or drastically reduce funding for the Corporation for National and Community Service.The mission of AmeriCorps is sensible: provide educational opportunities for young people who serve their community in ways that make a real difference in the lives of others.In my district, AmeriCorps members have partnered with professionals and nonprofit agencies to help immunize children, revitalize and clean up inner city neighborhoods, install smoke alarms in the homes of the elderly, and weatherize homes in low income areas. On Earth Day this year, I assisted AmeriCorps members with planting a community garden in a vacant lot once strewn with debris. The lot now is a source of neighborhood pride.AmeriCorps members continually champion the cause of community service by their collective and individual efforts.

2652,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge Elizabeth S. O'Keefe of Whitfield School, one of the winners of the 1996 Toyota Tapestry program.The Toyota Tapestry program, which is administered by the National Science Teachers Association, began 5 years ago and has awarded more than $1.6 million in grants to teachers in the United States. Each year, 40 outstanding K-12 grade teachers are given grants of up to $10,000 to implement innovative 1-year programs to enhance science education in their schools. The winning teachers have developed projects that demonstrate creativity, involve risk-taking, possesses visionary qualities, and model a unique way of presenting science.Ms. O'Keefe's winning project was to develop a unique study on ground water in caves. Because caves are void of photosynthetic organisms and litter, the water contains dissolved nutrients as well as herbicides and pesticides that percolate through rock and soil layers into cave streams. Rivers and springs are tested for pollutants; however, there is no systematic evaluation of pollution in cave water. O'Keefe's seventh grade classes will collect and evaluate water samples from 10 cave sites that were tested over 20 years ago, and determine what environmental and geological changes have occurred over this period.Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to pay tribute to Elizabeth O'Keefe, and commend her upon her efforts in ensuring the next generation a quality foundation from where they can pursue their ambitions. I join the National Science Teachers's Association in honoring the excellent work that she has been able to accomplish.,2015-03-17 19:10:45.743710,2015-03-17 19:10:45.743710,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH S.

2653,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you, Mr. President. I will make a few remarks about the amendment which I proposed.I want to reinforce again the concept that we need to change the character of welfare. We need to change welfare from being a condition in which people exist to being a transition from dependency--not only from dependency but long-term dependency--to independence, to work, to growth, and to opportunity. If we are going to do that, we should not acquiesce to a 5-year limit which allows people to go onto welfare and just get on it and stay for 5 years without doing anything. We should require of individuals--or at least provide that States require of individuals--that a number of things be done.One, we should say no longer can you stay on welfare for more than 24 months in any one stretch without going to work or preparing for work by taking work training and getting an education.Second, we should say never can you stay on welfare if you do not fulfill your responsibility to send your kids to school. If you are going to be on welfare, your kids ought to be in school. Children who are in school are less of a burden to individuals on welfare than children who are allowed to stay home or otherwise avoid their responsibility.Third, if we expect people eventually to become self-reliant in their own setting, we are going to have to ask those individuals to have fundamental educational qualifications as well. In my judgment, that is the reason we ought to allow States to require that individuals who are seeking to continue to receive welfare benefits either have or be in the process of attaining the kind of educational qualifications that would come with a high school diploma or a GED.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back on the amendment.,2015-03-17 19:10:45.892811,2015-03-17 19:10:45.892811,Senate,PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1996,1996-07-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-22/html/CREC-1996-07-22-pt1-PgS8395-5.htm,108,80,142,S8395-S8426,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2654,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise again today to express my support of one of our Nation's greatest success stories for our youth, the AmeriCorps Program. While the VA-HUD conference report does not provide the President's full funding request for AmeriCorps, it does appropriate $403 million in fiscal year 1997, an amount equal to the current funding level. This is an enormous improvement over the House-passed bill which eliminated funding for the program entirely. The mission of AmeriCorps is sensible: provide educational opportunities for young people who serve their community in ways that make a real difference in the lives of others.In my district, AmeriCorps members have partnered with professionals and nonprofit agencies to help immunize children, revitalize and clean up inner city neighborhoods, install smoke alarms in the homes of the elderly, and weatherize homes in low income areas. On Earth Day this year, I assisted AmeriCorps members with planting a community garden in a vacant lot once strewn with debris. The lot now is a source of neighborhood pride.AmeriCorps members continually champion the cause of community service by their collective and individual efforts. In my community, members have worked with community police officers to initiate neighborhood watch programs and shut down drug houses. The energy of these young people has inspired many families to get more involved to preserve and protect their neighborhood. As a result, Kansas City is cleaner, safer, and more livable because AmeriCorps has made its mark.As we work to balance the Federal budget, I believe we must set smart priorities.

2655,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, today I ask all members of the House to join me in honoring the Missouri State Society Daughters of the American Revolution (MSSDAR) as they celebrate a ``Century of Service'' at their 100th State Conference on March 12-14, 1999. The century celebration will feature remembrances of ten decades of conference highlights, recognition of this year's Outstanding State History Teacher, and the presentation of scholarships and awards to exemplary Missouri students. The first state conference was held in a stately St. Louis home on November 15, 1899 with eight members in attendance.Today, the MSSDAR, founded in 1894 in Kansas City, has over 5,500 members in 116 Chapters throughout the state dedicated to historic preservation, promotion of education and patriotic endeavor. Additionally, they play a leadership role in helping inform its members and the general public about the need for a strong national defense.The MSSDAR is affiliated with the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR). Incorporated by an Act of Congress in 1896, the NSDAR is a non-profit, non-political, volunteer service organization with nearly 180,000 women in some 3,000 chapters in each of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Australia, Canada, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Japan. The Society was founded in Washington, D.C. on October 11, 1890, and has celebrated more than 100 years of service to the nation.Mr. Speaker, I know the Members of the House will join me in paying tribute to the Missouri State Society Daughters of the American Revolution as they celebrate their ``Century of Service.'',2015-03-17 19:10:46.434208,2015-03-17 19:10:46.434208,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO THE MISSOURI STATE SOCIETY DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION,1999-03-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-10/html/CREC-1999-03-10-pt1-PgE378-2.htm,38,0,145,E378,S000465,mr. skelton
2656,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Early Childhood Development Act of 1999'' with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.Through this legislation, we are seeking to support families with the youngest children to find the early childhood education and quality child care programs that can help those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children need.Recent research shows that the first few years of life are an absolutely crucial developmental period for each child with a significant bearing on future prospects. During this time, infant brain development occurs more rapidly than previously thought, and the sensations and experiences of this time go a long way toward shaping that baby's mind in a way that has long-lasting effects on all aspects of the child's life.And parents and family are really the key to this development. Early, positive interaction with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other adults plays a critical role.Here's what's going on during these amazing early years that in so many ways are crucial to each child. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops over time. Most things happening in the surrounding world--such as a mother's caress, a father's voice, even playing with a brother or sister--helps this wiring pattern expand and connect. A baby with a stimulating environment will make these connections at a tremendous rate. However, infants and children who play very little or are rarely touched or stimulated develop brains that can be 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.Really we shouldn't be surprised that parents have known instinctively for generations some of these basic truths that science is just now figuring out. Most parents just know that babies need to be hugged, caressed, and spoken to.Of course, the types of interaction that can most enhance a child's development change as the baby's body and mind grow. The types of behavior that are so instinctual for the youngest babies may not be quite so obvious for two- and three-year-olds. Raising a child is perhaps the most important thing any of us will do, but it is also one of the most complicated.And parents today also face a variety of stresses and problems that were unheard of a generation ago. In many families, both parents work. Whether by choice or by necessity, many parents may not be able to read mountains of books and articles about parenting and child development to keep perfectly up-to-date on what types of experiences are most appropriate for their child at his or her particular stage of development. They also must try to find good child care and good environments where their children can be stimulated and educated while they work. Simply put, most parents can probably use a little help.Many communities across the country have developed successful early childhood development programs to meet these needs. Most of the programs work with parents to help them understand their child's development and to discuss ways to help further develop the little baby's potential. Others simply provide basic child care and an exciting learning environment for children of parents who both have to work.In a report released in 1998, the prestigious RAND Corporation reviewed early childhood programs like these and found that they provide higher-risk children with both short- and long-run benefits. These benefits include enhanced development of both the mind and the child's ability to interact with others, they include improvement in educational outcomes, and they include a long-term increase in self-sufficiency through finding jobs and staying off government programs.Of course, it's no mystery to many people from Missouri that this type of program can be successful. In Missouri, we are both proud and lucky to be the home of Parents as Teachers. This tremendous initiative is an early childhood parent education program that has been designed to empower all parents to giver their young child the best possible start in life. Expanding Parents as Teachers to a statewide program was perhaps my proudest accomplishment when I was Missouri's Governor.With additional resources, these programs could be expanded and enhanced to improve the opportunities for many more infants and young children. And we have found that all children can benefit from these programs. Economically successful, two-income families can benefit from early childhood programs just as much as a single-parent family with a mother seeking work opportunities.The legislation that Senator Kerry and I are introducing will support families by building on local initiatives like Parents as Teachers that have already been proven successful in working with families as they raise their infants and toddlers. The bill will help improve and expand these successful programs, of which there are numerous other examples, such as programs sponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as state initiatives such as ``Success by Six'' in Massachusetts and Vermont and the ``Early Childhood Initiative'' in Pennsylvania.The bill will provide federal funds to states to begin or expand local initiatives to provide early childhood education, parent education, and family support. The bill will also expand quality child care programs for families, especially infant care. Best of all, we propose to do this with no federal mandates, and few federal guidelines.Many of our society's problems, such as the high school dropout rate, drug and tobacco use, and juvenile crime can be traced in part to inadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities. Increasingly, research is showing us that a child's social and intellectual development as well as there likelihood to become involved in these types of difficulties is deeply rooted in the early interaction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years.Ultimately, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a child growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is the primary responsibility of his or her parents and family. Government cannot and should not become a substitute for parents and families, but we can help them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet the everyday challenges of parenting.

2657,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a distinguished career in teaching has come to an end. The Honorable Tom Hayes, Principal of Lexington Middle School, recently retired after 34 years as a teacher, coach, counselor, and administrator.Mr. Hayes started teaching in the Lexington school system as a student teacher in the spring of 1965. He was offered a contract to teach full time in the fall of the same year. Mr. Hayes served as a teacher, coach, and counselor until 1986, when he left Lexington to take a position in the St. James School District. In 1993, Mr. Hayes found his way back to Lexington to serve as principal at the Middle School.Mr. Hayes educated Missouri's youth and enjoyed watching his students grow and mature into adults. He is also gratified when the young people he taught come back to him years later as adults to thank him. As a coach, he coached multiple championship teams, both in football and wrestling. Through hard work focusing on fundamentals, he helped average athletes develop into skilled players.Although Mr. Hayes has retired from the Lexington School District, he is still an active community member as the Mayor of Lexington, Missouri.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Hayes had an outstanding career in education, and he will surely be missed by everyone at Lexington Middle School. I wish him and his wife Sherry all the best in the days ahead. I am certain that the Members of the House will join me in paying tribute to this fine Missourian.,2015-03-17 19:10:46.923544,2015-03-17 19:10:46.923544,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RETIRING MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL TOM HAYES,1999-06-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-06-16/html/CREC-1999-06-16-pt1-PgE1274.htm,85,0,145,E1274,S000465,mr. skelton
2658,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the democratic alternative to the Child Safety Act, offered by Mr. Conyers of Michigan. In particular, I urge my colleagues to support the funding for crisis prevention counselors and anti-violence initiatives in our local schools.Early intervention has been shown to greatly reduce incidences of violence in schools. Children who need help should be able to get help right away. There should be caring adults in the schools who can identify children who might be struggling with a problem or with anger before it is too late. We cannot cut corners when it comes to our children.The other body had the opportunity to adopt a true ban on juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault weapons, but instead they adopted a weak amendment that allows juveniles to possess semi-automatic assault weapons with parental consent. There is no legitimate reason for a teenager to possess a Street Sweeper or an Uzi. Juvenile possession of these weapons should be banned. This provision is an invitation for dangerous juveniles to manipulate or pressure a permissive or irresponsible parent into allow the teenager to have a deadly weapon. We have an opportunity to adopt a strong bill that will prioritize youth safety. Then we can advocate for this strong language when the bill is in conference.I hope that this Congress will prioritize school safety. I hope that we will make a commitment to our children to make their schools safer and more conducive to learning. I also hope that we will make a commitment to examine what our children are learning and to ask if they are receiving a quality education that prepares them to be responsible citizens in a democracy--to make good, informed choices; to live in peace with their neighbors and coworkers; and to enjoy life to the fullest extent possible.,2015-03-17 19:10:47.069649,2015-03-17 19:10:47.069649,House,Mr. CAMPBELL.

These students set their sights high, and as a result, competed in the National High School Speech and Debate tournament.Two thousands students from all over the country competed in the tournament this year. To qualify these students first competed in rigorous district competitions. Marquette High School's speech and debate team, coached by Mrs. Kim Cranston, sent six talented students to national competition.First, Edward Tulin was named National Champion of Domestic Extemporaneous Speaking for 1999. Mr. Tulin has been competing in speech and debate for four years and spoke in 13 rounds of competition to win the title.Second, there were five other students who competed and excelled at the national level. These students were: Justin Kempf who placed 8th in Student Congress' Senate division. Emily Vreeland who was a Semifinalist in Student Congress' House division. Jane Diecker and Edward Tulin who advanced to the 2nd level of competition in Policy Debate. Kane Huang and Elise Manning who competed in the Duo Interpretation competition.And finally, I would like to recognize Mrs. Kim Cranston whose dedication and tireless efforts have aided in the success of these students and many more. Her commitment to education and belief in the potential of each student is an example of excellence in teaching.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to recognize these extraordinary young people for their achievements. Their success is a true reflection on not only their drive and determination, but also on the parents, family members, and teachers who have supported their hard work and determination. These students are an excellent example of what young people will achieve when given the opportunity.,2015-03-17 19:10:47.301815,2015-03-17 19:10:47.301815,Extensions,WINNERS AT THE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SPEECH AND DEBATE TOURNAMENT,1999-06-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-06-29/html/CREC-1999-06-29-pt1-PgE1424.htm,94,0,145,E1424,T000024,mr. talent
2660,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Marion Leslie (M.L.) Anson, 77, of Higginsville, Missouri.Mr. Anson was born December 23, 1921, in Higginsville and lived most of his lifetime in the Higginsville area. He was a 1940 graduate of Higginsville High School and also a graduate of Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. He was a member and past president of Phi Delta Theta, a social fraternity. Mr. Anson served with the United States Navy in the Pacific Theatre during world War II with the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade.He was a former member of the Higginsville Board of Aldermen, the Higginsville Board of Education, and a founding member of the Higginsville Country Club, where he served as a member of the Board of Directors. He was a past member of the Lion's Club and was active in the Boy Scouts, serving in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say. He was a member of the Higginsville American Legion Post #223 and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #6270. Mr. Anson was a sponsor of the Save our Strays program in Lafayette County. He was also a member of Central Christian Church in Higginsville, where he served as a deacon and was a longtime member of the church choir.Mr. Anson was the secretary-treasurer and co-owner with his son, Joseph, of Anson Implement, Inc., a John Deere Dealership in Higginsville. He was a former co-owner of the Smith-Anson Implement Company in Odessa, until the early 1950s, when he joined the Higginsville business with his father, Leslie Anson, and his brother-in-law, James O.

2661,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, May 17, 1999, marked the 45th anniversary of the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education holding racial segregation laws and practices unconstitutional and ushering in the civil rights era. Last month the Harvard Civil Rights Project published a report showing that the nation is now moving backwards toward re-segregation of public schools.I want to call the attention of my colleagues to the remarkable story of desegregation in St. Louis. St. Louis illustrates the gains that can be made for children even in these times. In St. Louis, a 1983 settlement of a desegregation case brought by the NAACP resulted in the largest voluntary metropolitan school desegregation program in the nation, with 13,000 black students from St. Louis attending school in 16 suburban districts. The program was very successful in increasing the graduation and college-going rates of participating youngsters as was a magnet program in city schools.When the State sought to end its financing of the remedy in the early 1990's many feared that the opportunities that had been afforded children would end as had happened elsewhere. But an extraordinary thing happened. The Missouri State legislature voted funds sufficient to continue the programs--including as well as major program for school improvements in St. Louis--for at least ten more years. The legislature insisted that the city of St. Louis contribute financially by raising its sales and property taxes. Many feared that this would not occur. But in February of this year the voters approved a sales tax increased by an almost 2-1 margin--and every Ward in the City--Black and White--voted for the tax increase.Many people in Missouri worked hard to achieve this remarkable result. Special thanks are due to William H. Danforth, the Court-appointed settlement coordinator, who recognized that continuing a valuable remedy was not inconsistent with ending court supervision. James De Clue, the NAACP leader and Minnie Liddell, the community leader, toiled over twenty five years to advance the interests of children, they are the true heroes of this story. Legislative leadership was exercised by then-Representative Steve Stoll along with Senators Ted House, Lacy Clay and Harold Caskey. My colleague Congressman Richard Gephardt also helped assure that St. Louisans understood the importance of passing the referendum while business and religious leaders pitched in and lent their support.Mr. Speaker, we must not give up on the promise of Brown v. Board of Education. The St. Louis story provides a model for other communities. I would like to share with my colleagues some articles that detail the success of St. Louis' school desegregation program.The clock on the library wall at Yeatman Middle School in St. Louis said 15 minutes after 2 p.m. Dozens of lawyers, school superintendents, school board members and settlement coordinator Dr. William H. Danforth were waiting to announce an agreement to settle the area's school desegregation case. A lawyer turned to another lawyer and asked, ``Everyone important seems to be here. Who are we waiting for?'' Moments later, Minnie Liddell, regal in a flowing red blouse and slacks and moving slowly with the aid of a four- pronged metal cane, entered the library. Knots of people parted to let her through. Some hugged her. Twenty-seven years ago, when school officials tried to transfer her son, Craton, and other students, out of Yeatman School--a school the Liddell family had fallen in love with-- she and other parents sued the St. Louis School Board. Now Liddell, 59, who has three grandchildren in St. Louis schools, watched as Danforth announced the settlement, something many had predicted was impossible. ``There has been an agreement to settle the case,'' said Danforth, adding that the agreement would be presented to U.S. District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr. ``This is a historic occasion for St. Louis.`` Danforth said many people had told him it was impossible to settle a suit with more than 20 parties. ``It did take time. I never had any idea how complicated the legal issues were,'' he said. ``What we all wanted was to provide children with a first-class education and the opportunity for choice. We all wanted the voluntary transfer program to continue with this settlement.'' After Danforth spoke, Liddell said with obvious emotion: ``All I can say is, `Yay, St. Louis`` This has been a long time coming, yet we have just begun. I'm glad I lived to see a settlement in the case.'' Liddell suffered a stroke a couple years ago and suffers from numerous health problems. The settlement still needs approval of area school boards. Besides St. Louis, 16 St. Louis County districts were parties in the suit. Clayton and Parkway school boards were expected to meet in closed sessions Wednesday night to discuss the settlement. The Rockwood School Board might consider the agreement tonight. The St. Louis School Board already has approved the agreement. Other parties might agree with Liddell. Until the end, the deal to settle the St. Louis desegregation case was in danger of breaking apart. Until the deal was notched around noon Wednesday, anything was possible, said the attorneys involved in the case. The talks had become more frequent, and often ran late, in the past two weeks while students were on holiday break. The talks New Year's Eve lasted until 8 p.m. On Monday and Tuesday, attorneys and officials representing the more than 20 parties in the case met from before noon to past midnight at the downtown offices of Bryan Cave, a law firm in St. Louis. Tuesday's schedule followed suit. As the clock continued to tick past the self-imposed, end- of-the-year deadline, tempers flared. ``We were dealing with difficult issues and people got tired,'' said Douglas Copeland, an attorney who represents the Webster Groves and Valley Park school districts. ``No one ever came to blows.'' The attorneys and others involved in the talks have declined to discuss specifics because they were muzzled by a federal judge. But two key issues that remained unresolved until the end were the county districts' concerns over the terms of the busing program and the city district's concerns over how much it would get for new schools when the students returned. Ken Brostron, the St. Louis School Board's attorney, said a deal wasn't worked out on how much money the city would get for new schools until Tuesday evening. That figure is $180 million. The county districts' concerns over the busing plan, especially over how long they would have to commit to it and who would pay for it, weren't resolved until Wednesday morning. County superintendents had hoped that the state would pay for transportation for students to finish in the schools they attend. The problem was finding enough state money. County superintendents insisted that no local tax money would be used to pay for the education or transportation of transfer students--which the county districts got. Although issues related to St. Louis were resolved by Tuesday, county superintendents did not reach an agreement until shortly before noon Wednesday.

2662,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Texas for her outstanding work correcting a pernicious discrimination against the most valuable institution in our society, the family. I thank the chairman for his sensitivity to this important issue, for placing in this bill procedures to remedy the marriage penalty.The marriage penalty simply is an anomaly. It is a strangeness in the tax structure that has evolved, that penalizes people for being married. It puts them into higher tax brackets when they get married than when they were single. When people get married, they start paying a tax penalty. That is something we should stop.The Senator from Texas and the chairman of this committee have agreed that we should stop it. And we should, as a matter of fact, according to the amendment of the Senator from Texas, of which I am an original cosponsor along with Senator Brownback, accelerate the time at which we begin to stop this very serious fault with the tax system.America should not penalize the family. It should not make it harder for people to have families. It should not make it financially more difficult for two people to be married and live together than unmarried and live together. That is a simple fact. It is because the family is the best department of social services, the best department of education; it is the best place in which individuals are enriched to learn individual responsibility and the values and character our culture needs to survive. I am very pleased to be a part of this tax measure which will say about America's families that we cherish them rather than punish them and it is time for all of us to join together and eliminate the marriage tax penalty.,2015-03-17 19:10:47.924256,2015-03-17 19:10:47.924256,Senate,TAXPAYER REFUND ACT OF 1999,1999-07-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-30/html/CREC-1999-07-30-pt1-PgS9885-7.htm,110,30,145,S9885-S9937,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2663,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this conference report.I rise in opposition to the conference agreement on H.R. 2488, the Financial Freedom Act.This bill is the Republican's risky scheme for how they want to help the rich. The majority knows that their only bread and butter issue is tax cuts, whether or not the American people ask for them, whether there is a budget surplus or a deficit, and whether other important tax cuts instead or priorities get squeezed out, such as protecting Social Security, saving Medicare, strengthening education, and paying down the national debt.The American people won't be fooled. This bill provides very little for the average working family. The bottom sixty percent of Americans by income will only see about 8% of the tax cuts in this bill. Approximately $10 a month. Whereas, the top 10% of Americans will receive almost 70% of the benefits under this bill.Plain and simple, this bill is one big tax cut for those who need it the least.I would also like to mention that there are a number of pension provisions included in this bill, some of which are good policy and some which are not. Overall, however, this bill does little to significantly improve the retirement security of working Americans. Our current pension and tax system already favors the well-off. Over 80% of individuals earning over $75,000 a year have tax deferred pension income whereas only 8% of those earning under $10,000 and 27% earning between $10,000 and $15,000 have pension coverage.I oppose this irresponsible raid on our Federal budget to benefit the wealthy and special interest at the expense of the average working family.,2015-03-17 19:10:48.378585,2015-03-17 19:10:48.378585,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2488, TAXPAYER REFUND AND RELIEF ACT OF 1999,1999-08-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-08-05/html/CREC-1999-08-05-pt1-PgH7252-4.htm,114,89,145,H7252-H7276,C000488,mr. clay
2664,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.Mr. Speaker, I support access and choice for the uninsured health care consumer. However, I rise in opposition to the proposal before us today because it will not deliver on either. It fails because it promotes such flawed ideas as association health plans.Many experts have criticized association health plans, yet Republicans continue to trumpet them. They do so at the behest of their special interest friends, and not because of any real demand from health care consumers. The dangers inherent in association health plans became apparent to me when legislation to establish them was first considered by the Committee on Education and the Workforce back in The experts told us then that they had major concerns about the effect on the insurance marketplace. The National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners advise that Association Health Plans would undermine positive State reforms already in place to help consumers and would contribute to the collapse of small group health insurance.According to CBO, Association Health Plans would increase the risk of health plan failures and allow groups of healthier people to receive favorable premium rates while leaving groups with sick and elderly enrollees to pay higher ones.The American Academy of Actuaries advise that Association Health Plans could increase solvency risks and create regulatory confusion. The Urban Institutes Research determined that Association Health Plans would not reduce the number of the uninsured because nonparticipating firms are likely to drop their health insurance coverage rather than pay the higher rates that would result from a deteriorating risk pool.I urge my colleagues to reject these dangerous remedies and vote no on H.R. 2990.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:10:48.599741,2015-03-17 19:10:48.599741,House,QUALITY CARE FOR THE UNINSURED ACT OF 1999,1999-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-06/html/CREC-1999-10-06-pt1-PgH9431-2.htm,134,37,145,H9431-H9474,C000488,mr. clay
2665,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I received many letters about this issue. Here is one from a constituent in St. Joseph, MO, Mr. Craig Drummond, who is the Drake University student body vice president.I don't know why he went all the way to Iowa to get his education, but Drake is a fine institution.He states it this way:The United States is a country that was founded on the premise of freedom, democracy and sovereignty. We enact policies, laws and regulations that best exhibit the highest ideals of democracy and the American public. For the most part, we do a good job and function well as a powerful global leader. I am a proponent of democracy and capitalism and hold the values and ideas of the aforementioned paramount to any other country or government. The United States has problems and for the most part we are aware of these and have good people working to rectify our problems and wrongs. That is why this whole Cuba situation intrigues me so much. Why does America continue to have an embargo against trade with Cuba? Why have we chosen to isolate Cuba and ourselves from each other?I think the point here that ought to be made is a point that needs to be made over and over again. For food and medicine, we don't strengthen the regime; we strengthen the people. Strengthening oppressed people is what is fundamentally appropriate in terms of eventually allowing them to survive oppressive regimes.I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:10:48.810886,2015-03-17 19:10:48.810886,Senate,AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT,1999-10-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-13/html/CREC-1999-10-13-pt1-PgS12449-7.htm,138,13,145,S12449-S12465,A000356,mr. ashcroft

McVey has been a Member of Pipefitters Local 562, St. Louis, Missouri, since 1954. In 1978, he was elected Secretary-Treasury of the Missouri State Labor Council for the AFL-CIO, a position he served until 1982. McVey was then elected President of the Missouri AFL-CIO in 1982. In the 17 years he has headed the Missouri AFL-CIO, he has raised the level of involvement by unions in governmental affairs.In addition to his service in the AFL-CIO, McVey has been a leader in his community by serving on various councils and committees. He currently serves on the Missouri Training and Employment Council, and has been a member of Trustees of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri since 1992. McVey serves on the Missouri Business Council, the Missouri Task Force on Workers Compensation, the Commission on Management and Productivity, and the Missouri State Council on Vocational Education.

I would like to extend my congratulations to Mattie who has shown a life-long commitment to her family, her community and her church.Mattie is the daughter of the late John and Eliza Ross. She was born in Grenada, MS, on December 21, 1900. She grew up on a farm and her education was limited to the 4th grade because she had to work in the fields. She has two sisters and one brother.In 1924, Mattie moved to Swan Lake, MS. There she married Nathaniel Sharkey, and they are the parents of five girls. In 1929, the family moved to Portageville, MO. They purchased a farm located on River Road near Point Pleasant. In 1936, Mattie's husband passed away. Mattie continued to live and work on the River Road farm with her children. The girls attended school and went to high school in New Madrid, MO. After the girls left home, Mattie moved to the town of Portageville, where she was active at Zion Rock Baptist Church. Mattie also has been active in her community as a member of the NAACP and the 4-H Club and as a volunteer at the community center where she worked with girls.Mattie's daughters have made sure that she has had an opportunity to travel. Some of the places she has traveled include Hawaii, Bahamas Island, California, Mexico, Canada, Niagara Falls, New York and Chicago. Mattie currently lives in Sikeston, MO with her daughter, Eliza Strickland.Congratulations Mattie, on your recognition by the ``Daughters of Sunset.''

2668,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,I thank the gentleman for yielding.Mr. Speaker, this measure before the House today is very well one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will pass regarding national security.I first must compliment the chairman, compliment his staff, as well as the staff of the Armed Services Committee, who worked diligently to craft this piece of legislation. It's very important because Pakistan is very important. Pakistan is important to the Middle East and our intentions there. Their cooperation, of course, is so very, very important. This legislation gives economic and democratic development assistance to that country.What is, of course, of great interest to me is the security assistance that we have given Pakistan, some $400 million. I will leave it to the chairman, the very able chairman, to go into the details, but I must say that it not only provides for training and financing, one part that seems to be overlooked so often is the part that deals with the international military education, which has for a period of time missed out with this country of Pakistan, which again is back on our radar, and hopefully will be of great benefit to them as well as to us. It requires certain milestones to be met.Under the able leadership of this chairman, this is an excellent bill. I wholly endorse it. I certainly hope that we will get a very, very strong vote because the future of Pakistan is a centerpiece that we need to be successful for our efforts in that part of the world.With that, I again thank the chairman and compliment him, as well as all those who worked on it.,2015-03-17 19:10:49.256208,2015-03-17 19:10:49.256208,House,PAKISTAN ENDURING ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2009,2009-06-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-06-11/html/CREC-2009-06-11-pt1-PgH6551-4.htm,87,9,155,H6551-H6584,S000465,mr. skelton

While in Washington, the students visited the Capitol, Library of Congress, Smithsonian museums, and the many monuments along the National Mall celebrating our heritage.It is no easy task to plan and coordinate a trip involving such a large number of students and parents, but the support of the Springfield community helps make these trips a continued success, including the help of Anne Lanzilotta, the group's tour guide for the last 28 years, and his fellow teachers Scott Corn and Cale McAninch who have assisted him on the annual trips for the last 15 years.Kevin's passion for American history runs through his family. His wife Valerie and two sons Tristan and Trevor have attended multiple trips and not only encourage his efforts, they enjoy them. Kevin continues the tour of the capital because he wants all of his students to experience the history of our country through the monuments, museums, and memorials, as well as to share that love for country, that awestruck feeling he received every time he traveled to Washington. He credits his work ethic to the examples set by his parents, Luther and Joyce, and the support he received growing up from his younger brother Dwight.Kevin hopes that these annual trips will motivate or inspire some of his young students to return to Washington as elected officials and embrace new ideas for the future of our great nation.

And if you will allow me to just wax a little bit philosophical.This country was put together, and unlike any other country in the world America is a Nation that was founded on a creed. There are many things that are distinctive about America. We have the oldest Constitution. We have won a number of wars and ceded no territory. We have named no emperors, crowned no kings. And what we did was we taxed ourselves to rebuild.America is a very unique place, and there are many reasons why Americans could be proud of this country. But America also is a Nation that has, if you will, a political or religious creed, and that is stated in our own Declaration of Independence, why we went to war. And the sentence says: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. And it goes on to say: Among these is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Earlier versions of Jefferson's documents were life, liberty, and property.And then it goes on to say: Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers essentially to do, what? To protect life, liberty, property; life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.So if you take a look at that formula, what it is saying in simple terms is, there is a God. God grants all human beings certain basic rights, and the job of the government is to protect those rights now.Now, fast forward from 1776 to 1944, to the inaugural address by FDR. He said, well, that first Bill of Rights--which wasn't a Bill of Rights; it was a Declaration of Independence, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness--was okay for a while. But it wouldn't be any good if Americans are hungry or if an American needs a coat, or if some American is not secure. So we propose a second Bill of Rights, and that is that the government should give you jobs and education and health care and things like that.You note the clever twist here. The first rights are things that naturally occur to all people under God, the right to free speech, the right not to be killed, the right to own some property. These other kinds of things we are talking about now have a strange, strange parallel.We laughed some years ago in my past when we watched the Berlin Wall fall down and we said, we knew those commies or the USSR, that system would never work, communism, socialism. It won't work. Why was that? Well, because the government is going to give you your health care, the government is going to give you your food and your housing, the government is going to provide a job, the government is going to provide an education. And don't talk about God, because if you talk about God then you know you have natural rights from God, not rights that come from a government.So what we are doing in America with this kind of budget? What we are doing in America is the government is going to give you health care, the government is going to give you a job, the government is going to give you food and a place to live. The government is going to give you an education. How are we so different from the system we just watched fail?That is why the Europeans are laughing in their beers, looking at us and saying, has America been smoking those funny cigarettes or what? What are we doing? And I think that is the question we are trying to raise.I don't mean to be too philosophical, but where did we got off track? We got off track on the road to socialism, to the idea that the government is going to be all things to all people. And it does a lousy job of doing that.What we should be doing, quite simply, is protecting life and protecting people's basic liberties. And what are we talking about doing? We are talking about saying we are going to have a bureaucrat in D.C. to monitor what you put on your radio program. We are going to call that The Fairness Doctrine.We are going to take away your right to be able to vote without being compelled or feeling pressure, because we are going to get rid of the secret ballot election when it comes to joining a union or not. We are talking about taking away people's freedom to own a piece of property because some local government wants to take it and turn it into a strip mall so you don't have any private property rights.I mean, what is going on? How come we are giving up freedom? I don't think we are on the right track.I appreciate the gentleman with this hour, and I just felt like it was important to get back to what is basic in America, which is limited government that provides and protects our life, our liberty, and our property, instead of doing this institutionalized theft.,2015-03-17 19:10:50.678242,2015-03-17 19:10:50.678242,House,THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WE NOW FACE,2009-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-31/html/CREC-2009-03-31-pt1-PgH4219-8.htm,54,21,155,H4219-H4227,A000358,mr. akin
2677,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, this evening we're going to be continuing on a familiar theme for many, probably the single issue that rivets the attention of Americans perhaps more than any single debate and discussion and, that is the change to American health care. This is not, of course, a small debate. It is a debate that involves a question of, to a large degree, whether the government is going to take over 18 percent of our economy. That's not a small section of our economy, 18 percent, nor is it a small question.Not only economically is it a big question, every one of us has to live inside our own bodies. So it is a very personal question. We have to live inside our bodies, and we're dependent on health care, and we hope that we can continue to enjoy the high quality of health care that we have had in America.But people recognize that there are problems with American health care. Those problems largely are not so much in the delivery of the health care but rather in how the health care is being paid for. So there are stresses in the system as to who's going to pick up the tab on it. We've seen a lot of examples of different departments of the Federal Government. It does amaze me just in a commonsense point of view why people would really want to trust their own personal health care with any department in the Federal Government when I think of the profound inefficiencies within many departments of government.We don't think of the post office as being a model of efficiency, the IRS as being any particular model of compassion or precision. If you think about the Energy Department, the Energy Department was founded on the idea that we had to make sure that America never had to rely on foreign sources of energy. Since that time, the Energy Department has grown in employees, and we have also grown on our dependence on foreign oil.Then you've got, of course, the Education Department. That is a model of something that I wouldn't put my trust in. In fact, there was a study done on the Education Department some years ago that concluded that if a foreign nation had done to America what the Education Department had done, it would be viewed as an act of war.Yet there are people in spite of this--and we've seen the Federal emergency management in response to Katrina and other departments of the Federal Government. In spite of that, people want to turn over 18 percent of our economy to the government.Well, when the government does too much, there are some things that we tend to see as becoming problematic. One of them is that you get some inefficiencies. You could get excessive expenses, degraded quality, or bureaucratic rationing.Is this something we need to worry about when we are talking about health care? Somebody quipped that if you think health care is too expensive now, just wait until it's free. We will take a look.Here is what was proposed in the House plan, right here. It's a 1,000 page bill, but you can summarize it in this nifty flowchart. All of the colored boxes are new parts, new moving pieces.You could see that it certainly doesn't meet the test of simplicity, that's for sure. People who have looked at this and studied it long enough say, I want to be the health care czar. He's the guy who makes all the decisions and determines who gets care and who doesn't.Tonight, we are going to be talking on the subject of health care. A lot of new information is breaking, new estimates from the Senate as to how much their plan is going to cost and how much is going to be taken out of Medicare on that plan.I am joined by some good friends of mine here, and I am thinking my friend GT is here. I am just going to recognize and yield to you, my friend, a Congressman who has not been here that many years and yet who has already earned a reputation far in disproportion to the amount of time he has served, and long on the common sense department, which I think we need a whole lot more of that common sense.,2015-03-17 19:10:50.842335,2015-03-17 19:10:50.842335,House,HEALTH CARE,2009-10-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-10-14/html/CREC-2009-10-14-pt1-PgH11362-8.htm,148,1,155,H11362-H11370,A000358,mr. akin
2678,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark a significant date in higher education in northeast Missouri. My congressional district is privileged to be home to many honorable and successful institutions of higher learning. Among them, Hannibal-LaGrange College this very month celebrates its sesquicentennial. For 150 years, Hannibal-LaGrange has provided quality Christian education to untold thousands of students while remaining true to its God-given principles and beliefs.The humble journey began in LaGrange, MO, about 30 miles north of the college's current campus. The college opened its doors on September 15, 1858, as the LaGrange Male and Female Seminary, founded by the Wyaconda Baptist Association. Steering this ship on the first leg of its journey was William Ellis. Ellis was the college's first president and just 24 years old when classes started in September 1858. The school's young journey was derailed just 4 years later when Union troops commandeered the college's facilities for use during the Civil War.Once the college reopened in 1866, Dr. Joshua Flood Cook, the new president, faced the awesome tasks of replacing equipment, textbooks, faculty and staff, as well as rebuilding campus facilities, community support and confidence. Cook successfully fought these battles and served as president for 30 years, advancing the institution perhaps more than any other single individual in its history.After 70 years in its LaGrange home, college leadership accepted an overture to move the campus south to the northeast edge of Hannibal. In 1927, Hannibal-LaGrange College opened the doors to its Hannibal campus, which still sits today on those 110 acres of scenic hills and woods on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River.The college continued to grow and serve the community through the middle part of the 20th century. In 1973, however, the college faced its first real test since the move to Hannibal. Inflation and other financial strains put the college's very future in jeopardy. Community leaders, area residents and HLG personnel forcefully answered in one voice, raising $85,000 to keep the college's doors open and averting what would have been the college's immediate closure.While 1973 marked the college's first test in Hannibal, it wasn't the last or most severe. Sixteen years later, on June 22, 1989, a small fire that started in the college's cafeteria area soon grew to a raging inferno, swallowing many of the college's vital facilities, including the campus' administration building, auditorium and gymnasium. Black smoke billowed into the air, visible from miles away. Emergency responders worked through the night to douse the fire. But doused with the fire were hopes and dreams for the coming fall semester and the collective futures of incoming students. By daylight, as only charred remains of the structures stood, any thoughts of a successful future vanished into the air with the remnants of the previous night's smoke.However, President Dr. Paul Brown began the next morning with a pledge to hold classes on campus that very fall. Dr. Brown led college trustees and personnel on a massive effort to rebuild and expand the campus. A large burlap tent was erected on campus for chapel services that fall, classes were held in dormitory basements and trailers on campus and a massive reconstruction program began in an effort to rebuild what had been lost.Just 3 years later, following the construction of a new sports complex, computer center and cafeteria, the college dedicated its new administration building under the leadership of Dr. Brown and current President Dr. Woodrow Burt. On the cornerstone of this building, built on the site of the administration building lost in the 1989 fire, is a passage from Isaiah 61:3, ``A crown of beauty instead of ashes.'' This building was later renamed for Dr. Burt, who became president of the college in 1995 and still proudly yet humbly serves in that position today.But the journey for HLG is not complete. The vision for the college's growth and service continued forward over the past decade, as the college constructed a new dormitory and the Roland Fine Arts Center, the centerpiece of the college's recent expansions. The college is also in the midst of a $30-million campaign, ``Building for the Future,'' which calls for the construction of a new library, allied health and science center and dormitory renovations, as well as enhancing the college's endowment.Throughout this journey, beating in the heart of HLG is a desire to serve Christ, embodied in the college's motto, ``Knowledge for Service.'' HLG strengthened this commitment over the last 4 years through its implementation of missions programs that serve both domestic and international missions opportunities year-round. HLG is a multiple recipient of the Courts Redford Award, the top award among U.S. colleges and universities for mobilizing students for missions with the North American Mission Board. In May of this year, HLG was named number one among 314 colleges and universities that send students to work with the NAMB.Madam Speaker, I was honored to stand before this Chamber 10 years ago to commend HLG's commitment to excellence and its use of knowledge for service during their 140th anniversary. I am again privileged to stand before this body and congratulate my friends at HLG for 150 years of quality Christian education. May God continue to bless this fine institution for many years to come.,2015-03-17 19:10:51.152556,2015-03-17 19:10:51.152556,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO HANNIBAL LaGRANGE COLLEGE,2008-09-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-09-09/html/CREC-2008-09-09-pt1-PgE1739-3.htm,142,0,154,E1739-E1740,H000948,mr. hulshof
2679,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, my colleagues are all aware of my pending departure at the end of this Congress. Since my announcement, not a day has gone by without someone wishing me their best or an organization or a university giving me a tribute in acknowledgment of my commitment to their causes.For 32 years, I have served in this body representing the people of Missouri, but Madam Speaker, there is another person who has served beside me for those 32 years and will also leave this House at the end of this session. She was never elected to this body, never placed her signature on the corner of any bill that was placed in the hopper, but she has had a great impact on the proceedings of this House. That person, Madam Speaker, is Gail Weiss, the Democratic staff director of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.At the end of the Johnson administration, she was a young legislative liaison in the office of Economic Development who chose not to stay on for the new Nixon administration. I was a new Member in need of a legislative assistant who knew the issues of my committee assignment, education and labor. Gail came to work for me, and other than for a brief sabbatical to live in London working for a British member of parliament, she has been at my side for the entire 32 years.After a few years in my personal office, she additionally has assisted me on the Education and Labor staff, then the Post Office and Civil Service staff, where she became the queen of amending the Hatch Act. For 20 years, she carried the torch to grant political rights to Federal and postal workers, and finally stood proudly by my side as President Clinton signed my bill into law allowing for those rights. This was shortly after she stood by my side as President Clinton signed his first bill into law, another piece of Clay legislation that Gail helped to enact, the Family and Medical Leave Act.As the last staff director of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, she turned out the lights after my colleagues from the majority abolished that committee. She did so with a smile and the resolve that showed she was dedicated to serving this House. No words or phrases could tear down the commitment she had to help fight to improve the lives of working families and to raise the standard of living for the less fortunate among us.Dedication and commitment are words often bantered about in tributes to Members of this House, but rarely have words so aptly described a staff member. Gail's demeanor has always been predicated upon hard work. Ask any of her colleagues to describe her, and they will always say fair, frank, honest, and hard working. She lived by the motto of never asking anyone to do anything that she would not do. There is no doubt about her toughness, her tenacity, and her frank New York mannerisms. But at the end of the battle, she always has a smile on her face.When our party lost control of this House, many wondered how we could protect the ideals and philosophy that we were committed to. Gail helped to find a way to do just that. When I informed her that we would lose 75 percent of the staff we had operated with, she just smiled and thought of how we could get jobs for those who were leaving.So I am very fortunate that Gail has been committed to my legislative ideas. We all are blessed by the dedication of great staff members. But 32 years, 16 Congresses is a tenure of service rarely achieved. There are few legislative times that have served as long as Gail.I once said that she was my fair lady. But she is one of the fairest ladies to have graced this House. I ask that my colleagues join me in expressing our thanks, appreciation, and admiration for her service, loyalty, and friendship. Because of her presence, my service in this House, in this Congress, has been for the better.So, Madam Speaker, I thank Gail, my fair lady, for helping to make that possible.,2015-03-17 19:10:51.427750,2015-03-17 19:10:51.427750,House,TRIBUTE TO GAIL WEISS,2000-10-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-24/html/CREC-2000-10-24-pt1-PgH10755-3.htm,134,1,146,H10755,C000488,mr. clay
2680,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to a Republican tax package that reflects this Congress at its worst. This package reveals the larger flaws of the Republican tax philosophy that have been on exhibit over these past years, really a 6-year attempt to give tax cuts to people and institutions that do not need them and not giving tax relief to people and institutions that need tax relief.First, there is nothing in this bill that guarantees a single new school will be built. The only thing we have had from Republicans is a consistent effort to fuzz the issue of who is for school construction and who is against it.Two days ago, Republican leaders rejected the bipartisan Johnson-Rangel bill supported by 228 Members, Democrats and Republicans, to help districts with school construction; and they came up with a different plan that was a day late and a dollar short.The largest part of that plan creates incentives that we think actually delay school construction, and half the benefit does not even go to school districts but to bondholders, private investors, not children, not principals, not teachers, but bondholders.This is a typical ploy, part of an effort to fool people into thinking that they support education. This has become an exercise in illusion.They put forward school construction provisions that bear resemblance to Democratic and bipartisan bills in name only. They trudge to the Capitol and hold press conferences a few hours ago and talk about middle-class fairness when nothing could be farther from the truth. We call on the leadership to bring up the bipartisan school construction measure to help modernize our schools in the Labor-HHS-Education bill. The Johnson-Rangel bill reduces the burden on local taxpayers struggling to finance new school construction in their communities. We further urge the leadership to set aside their opposition and drop the tax cuts that really do not perform a useful function. They should provide enough funding for teachers, emergency school repairs, after-school programs, teacher training and put all of these measures in the Labor-HHS-Education bill so that the President can sign a bill that improves our schools this year in all of these ways.This package is just as flawed on the health care side. After blocking an effective Patients' Bill of Rights, an effective prescription drug benefit under Medicare, now Republicans come forward with a package that does not help the vast majority of Americans or square with the needs of working families. The BBA piece does not do enough for people and hospitals and gives too much for HMOs. Their deductions will not substantially reduce the number of Americans without health insurance, they weaken employer-based health coverage, and they do virtually nothing for families who provide their own long-term care.We support restoring cuts to Medicare. We want tax relief. In fact, the President and Democrats have put forward a sensible bill that helps fix the problems for providers and beneficiaries in Medicare and Medicaid and gives relief to families and hospitals that truly need it. But Republicans choose to go behind closed doors and not tell us what is in their tax package until a few hours before it comes on the floor. They choose the path of conflict, not consensus. Dictation, not dialogue.Well, the President is going to veto this bill; and we are going to be right back here where we started passing more CRs because we were unable to do the work of working with one another to get the job done. The package we reject today reflects the larger problems with misplaced priorities, misplaced tax cuts, and raids on Social Security.Just today, a nonpartisan group of financial experts predicted that Governor Bush could not cut taxes and divert Social Security payroll taxes without blowing a huge hole in the budget. The Nation's best economists and actuaries found that by 2015, Governor Bush's plan would return us to the days of big deficits. His plan would undermine Social Security, and we would be headed right back to where we were in a sea of red ink in the 1980s. This makes clear that the Bush plan would weaken Social Security and ruin fiscal discipline.So we are not getting our work done. We are not hiring a single new teacher. We are not improving a single new school building. We have not spent a dime on quality teaching and after-school programs. We need to make the passion and purpose of this Congress in its closing days our children, our public schools, our teachers, our parents, our children, making sure that every child in this society is a productive, law-abiding citizen. We are now going to have to pass a new CR every day because we are behind in our work. Let us get to work together to find a consensus to get these things done and get them done in the next 2 days.,2015-03-17 19:10:51.599866,2015-03-17 19:10:51.599866,House,House of Representatives,2000-10-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-26/html/CREC-2000-10-26-pt2-PgH11209.htm,136,28,146,H11209-H11230,G000132,mr. gephardt
2681,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the special White House school safety summit called by President Clinton for October. This conference will bring together educators, law enforcement officials, and parents to discuss methods for ensuring school safety.Our children are our future, and we must do everything we can to guarantee them a safe learning environment in our public schools. Unfortunately, many school children today face threats on a daily basis in their schools--if not more tragic acts, such as the recent shootings on school grounds.It is also important to recognize that every day, all across America, children are being threatened, harassed, and beaten. President Clinton quoted statistics showing that three out of four students claim that they have trouble with disruptive classmates. These children are not able to fulfill their full potential because they are too afraid or distracted to focus on learning.Problem students who show constant disregard for teachers' classroom rules cause disorder that prohibits learning. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in 1993-94, 23.6% of public school teachers indicated that student disrespect for teachers is a serious problem. When teachers are not in control, their morale is lowered, the students are afraid, and the time spent in school is wasted.Perhaps even more distressing are the students who simply do not attend school. Truancy leads to many criminal acts, including drug and alcohol use, gang activity, and violence. Further, truant students are not learning. When our children don't go to school, not only their own future, but also our country's future is threatened.I am a cosponsor of H.R. 4009, which will combat juvenile crime in our schools and amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. This bill encourages school based partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and school systems. Federal funding would be provided to hire School Resource Officers, who would work with the school to proactively address crime in the school.I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 2408, the After School Education and Safety Act of 1997, which would provide children with a safe and supervised place at the end of the school day. Safe places are especially important in the hours after school because this time frame poses the greatest risk for juveniles to be affected by criminal behavior. This bill would also create enrichment programs for the children to participate in, to increase their academic success and improve their intellectual, social, physical, and cultural skills.We must commit ourselves to taking responsibility for our children's educational future. Parents, teachers, and community leaders must work together to provide a safe and stimulating learning environment for our students. Our children deserve the best possible education we can provide, and they deserve to learn and grow in a safe environment.In my district, schools are using a variety of programs to keep kids safe. The Kansas City School District has used the ``Growing Healthy'' program in elementary schools for the last three years. This program utilizes materials on conflict resolution and violence prevention, but its main focus is on mental and physical health awareness.In Independence, Missouri, schools use a program developed by Alvin Brooks of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime titled, ``Stop the Violence,'' which includes a series of videos and speakers. In Fort Osage, schools have designed their own program to identify troubled students so as to enter them into early intervention counseling programs.Other strategies used in my home state of Missouri to increase school safety include placing police officers in schools, training student mediators, and installing metal detectors. Metal detectors have significantly reduced the number of weapons violations in the Kansas City district. During the 1992-93 school year, more than 100 weapons violations were reported in one month. This past year, weapons violations were down to 16 in a month.Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the ``First Annual Report on School Safety,'' which will be the result of the school safety summit. Participants in the President's summit on school safety will identify and share creative and effective solutions to the problems currently facing our public schools, such as those being implemented by Missouri school districts. I hope that my colleagues in Congress will take their ideas and concerns to heart and make school safety a top priority.,2015-03-17 19:10:51.771995,2015-03-17 19:10:51.771995,Extensions,SCHOOL SAFETY,1998-07-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-29/html/CREC-1998-07-29-pt1-PgE1461-2.htm,104,0,144,E1461,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2682,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I want to thank a number of Senators before I begin making my remarks because this amendment is the culmination of the work of a number of individuals, including Senators Hutchison, DeWine, Allard, Abraham of Michigan, Gregg of New Hampshire, Helms of North Carolina, and Senator Coverdell of Georgia. All of these individuals participated to assemble the components of this amendment, which is an amendment designed to promote safety in our schools and to prevent violence in our schools. So I thank all of those Senators. If any of them comes to the floor, I will happily yield to them for them to give particular emphasis to the items they brought to the table here.This amendment contains a number of provisions that give schools and communities additional ways to prevent youth violence. It would free local school districts to put Federal money to use where the Federal money will do the most good to prevent future violence.Under this amendment, schools will be able to choose where best to spend Federal resources under titles 4 and 6 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. These are allowable uses which would include violence prevention training, school safety equipment such as metal detectors, or for school resource officers.The amendment clarifies that nothing in Federal law stands in the way of a local decision to introduce a dress code or school uniform policy. Without taking the time at this moment, a number of schools would like to be able to do this. In the places where they have been able to do it, they have found that it reduces violence and increases student productivity. It has been good.This would allow schools, if they are going to use their Federal resources, to use them, and one of the permissible ways would be to invest in establishing such a policy.The amendment contains a provision that provides certain liability protections for school personnel when they undertake reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in safe educational circumstances or to promote an environment of safety for education. This is a very important provision. This one, sponsored by Senator Coverdell of Georgia, offers teachers limited civil liability against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits.We don't really need for teachers, who need to be involved in disciplining students, to be thinking about the fact that they are going to be sued if they exercise the right kind of discipline.The limits are reasonable. They are against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits--the kind of limit that we placed to help encourage volunteerism last year when we had the Volunteer Protection Act. That is the kind of thing we want to do to make sure that teachers can have better control and are free to take necessary steps to provide discipline in the classroom.Senator Helms' language makes certain that a school discipline record follows a student when a student transfers to another public or private school. The language allows schools to run background checks on any school employee who works with children. I think this is reasonable. We should know who the individuals are who are employed in our schools. Providing this kind of capacity and opportunity is a step in the right direction, a step forward. It is necessary for schools, especially given the mobility of students and families, to be able to know about the discipline record of a student who comes to the school. Learning too late can be a deadly matter, as I learned a few years ago in a tragic case in St. Louis, where a student transferred from one school to the next and the discipline record didn't follow. And before they learned of this student's propensity to stalk young women, he murdered another student, stalking a woman, a young woman, into the restroom of a high school.Senator DeWine has a provision that allows the coordination of adolescent mental health and substance abuse services. That is part of this amendment.The amendment includes language from Senator Abraham that allows schools to use Safe and Drug Free Schools funds for drug testing. Students who are the subject of serious discipline problems may well be better off if we have the capacity of asking them to undergo drug tests. We fund it and provide the availability or the freedom to use funds in that respect.I really want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this task force: Senators DeWine, Hutchinson, Gregg, Allard, Coverdell, Helms, and Hatch.I look forward to the passage of these proposals that are included in this education task force package: The amendments on school safety and violence prevention, and safety and security in our schools.I reserve the remainder of my time.,2015-03-17 19:10:51.987150,2015-03-17 19:10:51.987150,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-19/html/CREC-1999-05-19-pt1-PgS5507-7.htm,73,156,145,S5507-S5583,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2683,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I consider it a great tribute to have the Poplar Street Bridge renamed in my honor. I wish to thank those who participated in making this happen. Let me personally thank . . .Let me especially thank my friend, Representative Penny Hubbard, for her untiring effort in managing the bill through the legislature.Let me say to Rep. Penny and those that participated in naming this bridge in my honor that prior to this dedication, two bridges have had a special meaning in the life of the Clay family and me. The first was the McKinley Bridge, where the electric train carried my father, five days a week, back and forth, to work in Venice, Illinois, for more than 30 years.He earned a good living that enabled him to take care of his wife of 60 years and us 7 children. How can the Clay's not remember and appreciate what that fabulous bridge meant in our lives?The second bridge that had a tremendous influence in my life was the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma, Alabama. It was there on a Sunday that John Lewis and 600 other marchers attempted to cross on their way to Montgomery. They were peacefully demanding the right to register and vote like all other Americans.But Governor George Wallace ordered local and state police to stop the march on the flimsy ground of ``public safety.''What followed is now infamously known as ``Bloody Sunday.'' Police, armed with billy clubs, dogs, and tear gas, were seen around the world on television beating men, women, and children unmercifully.That scene on the Edmund Pettis Bridge was the stimulus for passing the 1965 Voting Rights Act and subsequently my election to Congress. At the time, there were only five blacks in Congress. Today, because of what happened on that bridge, there are 42 blacks.My mission while in Congress for 32 years was to build bridges that carried resources to the economically underprivileged, and to those discriminated against because of race, gender and age. My message to those of you still battling the forces of hatred and ignorance is to ignore that group of idiots that want to destroy bridges provided by government assistance. Do not join those chanting the idiotic slogan of ``government is the problem and should get out of the way.''Government has a sacred responsibility to play a major role in building bridges that elevate the standard of living for its citizens. It must build roads leading to bridges that take our children to schools, our adults to jobs, our sick to hospitals.Bridges must enable the working poor to move into the middle class and our seniors to live the remainder of their lives in dignity.You in the legislative body must always remember that bridges take people to untold opportunities. I am proud of the bridges I helped build while in Congress that now provide for family and medical leave, that gave political freedom to federal employees, that assured that after five years you are vested in your pension plan, that rewrote the higher education law, the elementary and secondary education bill, and, yes, Rep. Hubbard, the one that makes our workplace safe.Yes, Rep. Penny Hubbard, I know you will continue building bridges that take people from poverty to prosperity, from hopelessness to dreams fulfilled.Government must not let the excessive greed of some exploit the helpless in the name of providing jobs that pay less than a living wage.Government must provide the bridges that guarantee a good education for its citizens, a decent job with adequate pay and health benefits, a nice home in a safe neighborhood. If building bridges that establish a strong, vibrant middle class is seen as government being in the way, I say to those . . . well, I say that, and much more.OK, I have had my say. So, Rep. Penny Hubbard, let me thank you again for remembering that bridges have played an indispensable role in my life. Thanks for remembering that building bridges has made my life worth living.,2015-03-17 19:10:52.297370,2015-03-17 19:10:52.297370,Extensions,BRIDGE DEDICATION,2013-11-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-11-13/html/CREC-2013-11-13-pt1-PgE1648-4.htm,161,0,159,E1648-E1649,C001049,mr. clay
2684,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I believe the correct interpretation of Ed-Flex is that there is substantial flexibility accorded to Governors for certain programs--not for all programs--and I believe it would be a misstatement to characterize it in the way it was characterized in the question. But there is additional flexibility, and I voted for Ed-Flex because it was a step in the right direction.I don't purport to say the Governors should be the last word on this. From my perspective, we would be well served to push more of the decisionmaking authority down to the local level where the people who know the names of the students and the needs of the schools can make the determination.I have visited three or four dozen school districts in my State in the last 3 or 4 months. I have been very intensive in my examination. It is very important we understand that tailoring the resource to meet the needs of students to elevate student performance is very important.Sending money to feed the bureaucracy isn't important. The ultimate thing we need to determine is, are we doing those things that will elevate student performance? It may not even be the same thing in every case. There may be things needed in one area in one setting, in one cultural venue, that are different from in another. The presumption that Washington can know a single solution is as foolish as the idea that there is a single product that would suit everyone.Look at the march of industry in our country. We don't try to sell everybody the same computer. Look at the future. The future tells us if you call a fellow named Dell down in Texas, he doesn't tell you what computers he has to offer, he asks you what your needs are. They tailor that computer to meet your specific needs.It is called mass customization, not mass production. Mass production is a thing of the past. Mass customization is a thing of the future. Let's allow our school districts to tailor the resources we provide to meet their needs and to elevate their students' capacity. Let's not try to impose on those students some sort of template from Washington that pushes them into a program or something that is not in their best interests and not according to their needs. The idea of Washington imposing and distorting education is an idea whose time has past.In my State, there is a designation that is a result of a Federal program called IDEA. One in seven students in my State--and one in eight nationally--are designated as disabled. As a result of this designation, those students are not subject to discipline in the same way other students are. For example, if a disabled student brings a gun to school, the maximum time you can keep him out of the regular classroom is generally 45 days. Some of these disabilities, a good number of them, are behavioral disabilities, so they are students whose problem is in controlling themselves. Instead of having the 1-year suspension from class because they brought a weapon to school, they only have a 45-day suspension from class because they brought a weapon to school.It is very difficult for local school administrators to have a situation where they can't discipline students effectively to maintain order and control. I believe we ought to adjust that. We ought to get decisions about resource allocation down to the local level, to moms and dads, community leaders, school board members, to decide how to spend the resources to best elevate student performance. I think that is what they want to do with the money. That is what they want school resources for.I think we ought to also say to those people at the local and State level, you can make the kinds of decisions regarding discipline that are necessary in your culture and in your community and in your setting to secure the classroom and secure teachers. It is very important that be done, and be done in ways that will help students.The Missouri School Boards Association has talked to me recently about these kinds of circumstances. They have given me some examples of what has happened in their school districts in the area of IDEA, discipline, and safety. Here is one, ``Teacher Assault.''High school student with disabilities was placed in an alternative school after repeatedly assaulting her high school teachers. Recently aggravated, she approached the office. The secretary was talking with a person outside the office and did not see the student approach. The student hit the secretary in the side of the head, knocking her glasses off her face and causing personal injuries. This year the student has broken her teacher's glasses four times by hitting him in the face or pulling them from his face and breaking them. This behavior continues in spite of multiple years of interventions by mental health professionals, behavioral specialists and disability experts at school. The parents continue to meet on a regular basis with the school personnel. However, assaults are frequent and cause injury at home, at school and in the community. No agencies within the community or State will provide comprehensive treatment or services as she is considered too aggressive. She remains in public school.Not subject to the kind of discipline there ought to be.I can go through case after case of teacher assault. I can talk about students who have been shot by other students, students who were injured, whether it is with a knife or with a gun, and the absence of the capacity of our school administrators to deal with students who pose threats to the learning environment of our classrooms. It is a tragic absence of capacity. We ought to return that capacity to the local level. I believe it is possible for us to do so when we think carefully about our school; whether it be assaults on teachers, whether it be the possession of weapons, whether it be the importation of drugs into the schools.So it is with this in mind that I think trusting local school officials is the way for us to respond. We need to adopt the kind of philosophy that moves decisionmaking as well as resources to the local level. Just moving resources to the local level with an administrative burden and a direction to spend the resources in ways that are not needed at the local level is nonsense. Move the resources to the local level and move the decisionmaking capacity to people who know the names of the students and the needs of those students and the needs of the institution. Let them make decisions.Second, allow individuals who are running our schools at the State and local level to have the kind of rules and disciplinary procedures which provide a safe learning environment. If we do those things, we get to our ultimate accountability. The accountability is in student performance. Accountability is not in answering to Washington. Accountability is not answering to a bureaucracy. It is not filing tens of thousands of papers. Accountability is whether our students can read and write, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It is whether our students are prepared for a technically demanding world, a workplace where, if they succeed with the right education, it will provide them with a chance to be world leaders; where, if we do not succeed and our educational skills languish, our days are numbered as a leader of the world.It is with that in mind I want to say how important it is for us to not only have the right ability to send resources but decisionmaking as well to the local level, and then to provide a basis for maintaining a safe school environment by simply saying that school districts have the ability to discipline all children who bring weapons to school or use illegal drugs at school or possess them at school or children who assault school district personnel.I will close by just remarking that this is not something that is against the best interests of schools or of teachers or of groups of individuals. The Education Roundtable of Missouri, which is comprised of all the major education associations in Missouri, including the PTA, including the MNEA, including the AFT, including the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri School Boards Association--all of those endorse this idea that we need to have the capacity to discipline appropriately all students who bring weapons to schools, who assault teachers, who threaten and assault teachers and provide drugs in the school. They should be subject to appropriate discipline measures.I ask unanimous consent to have this letter from the Missouri Education Roundtable be printed in the Record and I thank the Chair for this opportunity to express myself on this important issue.,2015-03-17 19:10:52.505517,2015-03-17 19:10:52.505517,Senate,EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Resumed,2000-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-03/html/CREC-2000-05-03-pt1-PgS3284-2.htm,53,156,146,S3284-S3322,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2685,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I particularly thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts for yielding to me. I am very pleased to join with him in offering this critically important amendment.Late last year, Senator Kerry and I introduced legislation, which is bipartisan legislation aimed at providing support to help families give their children the kind of encouragement, love, early training and a healthy environment they need to develop their social and intellectual capacities. I have had the opportunity in my years both as Governor and in the Senate to work with children and work in the development of children. I am convinced that many of society's problems today--the high school dropout rate, drug and tobacco use, juvenile crime, even adult crime--can all be linked to inadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities.Let me just tell you a brief story about the first really broad-based early childhood development program that we put into effect in Missouri. Our Parents As Teachers Program was designed to provide assistance through educating and informing and giving helpful advice to parents of children from birth to 3 years old--how they could relate to the children, how they could establish better contact with the children, how they could excite the child's curiosity, to get involved with reading and learning. I was having a difficult time getting it through the Missouri legislature. I recommended it in 1981 and 1982 and 1983, and someone always had a reason to vote against it. I never got it through.Finally, in my last year as Governor I said we are going to make an all-out push because this program is making a difference. We were seeing in the pilot projects in four school districts that children whose parents had been in Parents As Teachers came to school ready to learn. Their parents had taken responsibility. The parents were involved in their education. They had developed the pattern of involvement. The program itself identified potential learning disabilities or physical disabilities early on, which could be best corrected at those early ages.I told everybody I was going to focus attention on early childhood development. Without my direct suggestion or intervention, the Director of Corrections, the Missouri Department of Corrections, the man who managed all of the prisons and the parole and probation efforts in Missouri, Dr. Leroy Black, on his own, came before the committee that was hearing testimony on Parents As Teachers. We had just gone on a major prison-building exercise in Missouri. In that 4 years of my second term we had increased the prison spaces 88 percent. People were wondering whether we could ever catch up with the prison population.He came before that committee with a very simple, straightforward message. He said if we want to cut down on the need to keep building prisons in the future, we are going to have to deal with early childhood development. He said the failures in early education, the failures of parental responsibility, the failures of the parents to be involved--for some care giver to make sure these children were getting an education, being taught responsibility--is the greatest cause of the increase in crime and the increase in prison population.He was successful. He was a great help in getting this program established on a Statewide basis. Yes, as Senator Kerry mentioned, we now have studies based on this program and others that show a child's social and intellectual development is deeply rooted in the early interaction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years and the scientific research shows that infant brain development occurs much more rapidly than previously thought.We used to think of those cute little infants, birth to 3 years old, as being cuddly, wonderful things without much going on. But brains are developing--50 percent of a child's mature learning capabilities are developed by the age of 3. They are in a very rapid mode of development.Anybody who has tried to teach a child to speak two languages instead of one language will find a very small child--you think they would learn English slowly--but they will learn another language, too, just as quickly, where an adult is having a great deal of difficulty trying to learn another language. They are in a rapid mode where they can accept new inputs and they are learning rapidly.The role parents and adults play is critical. That is when the patterns are established for the future learning of future responsibility of the children. I had long said the first 3 years of life was the greatest learning experience for a child. I found when our son Sam was born, that the first 3 years of his life were the fastest learning experience in my life. I learned a lot more in those 3 years than I had learned in many years as Governor and various offices that I had held.Learning about a child and learning how important that education is, is quite an experience. Frankly, some of the people who attacked our early childhood development program, Parents As Teachers, were accusing it of being subversive. They thought it was subversive because we were encouraging government to come in and take over the raising of children. That is not the purpose of the program. We provided the parents the tools to be the first educators of the children.Guess what happened. It was subversive in that it hooked the parents into the child's development and well-being and welfare and education. When we are talking about discouraging children from using tobacco, and as we did in the amendment adopted this week, from using drugs, from using alcohol, parental responsibility is a vitally important part of that program.We believe establishing responsibility can best occur with assistance through early childhood development. Parental responsibility is very important. Yet, there are times when parents need some help. That is what the other part of this bill does. Parents today face a variety of stresses that were unheard of a generation ago. Many families with children rely on more than one paycheck. That doesn't necessarily mean two 9-to-5 paychecks. Many families are working tag-team shifts or part-time only, or own home-based businesses so one parent can always be with the children. The challenges are tremendous and the challenges are not going to get any easier.As we all know, the most dangerous time of the day when children engage in harmful activities, such as tobacco or drug use or crime, is between the hours after school and before parents get home from work.In an average week in America, over 5 million children under the age of 13 come home to an empty house. These are the kids who are most vulnerable and who engage in activities which may threaten their future.Providing increased funding for early childhood development and constructive after-school activities will serve as a powerful deterrent to these damaging behaviors.Ultimately, however, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a child growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is most impacted by his or her parents and family. While government cannot and should not become a substitute for parents and family, we can help them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet every day challenges.The Kerry-Bond amendment achieves that goal.This amendment will lay the foundation needed to realize meaningful reductions in tobacco and drug use, juvenile crime, and other social ills which plague our society.Again, prevention is the key. Investing in early childhood development initiatives and before and after school activities is an important weapon in our fight against our Nation's unhealthy and life-threatening activities.The future well-being of our children is too important for us to break continually along partisan lines. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts for his hard work and dedication to this cause.,2015-03-17 19:10:52.745688,2015-03-17 19:10:52.745688,Senate,NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT,1998-06-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-11/html/CREC-1998-06-11-pt1-PgS6139-3.htm,75,20,144,S6139-S6146,B000611,mr. bond
2686,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, let me first of all thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) for providing this opportunity to pay tribute to our colleague on this occasion. Perhaps the best and most succinct summary of who and what Louis Stokes is about can be found in a statement appearing in a Cleveland newspaper 10 years ago when Mr. Stokes was celebrating his two decades in elective office. That article stated, ``This 20-year milestone in the United States Congress gives us pause to reflect on Lou Stokes, the man, a legend in the making, as he continues to make his mark in history. He improves the quality of our lives by example and effort.''Mr. Chairman, I want to acknowledge the friendship between Mr. Stokes and his wife Jay and my wife Carol that goes back 30 years. We came to this Congress on the same day 30 years ago, along with Shirley Chisholm, and the three of us, who joined with six other African American Members, really made history that day, because that made nine of us in the Congress, and that was the most black Members of Congress that had served together at one time in history.Stokes said to me shortly after that that because this was historic, that perhaps we ought to band together to really make a difference. As a result of his talking with myself and us talking with others of the nine, we formed the Congressional Black Caucus. And in this 30-year period, that caucus has made a difference. But Lou Stokes has definitely made a difference, and, as a result of that difference, all of us are proud today and all of us are better off.Stokes has made a big difference. He has put his staff, his imprimatur, on landmark legislation, which altered and affects the lives in dramatic ways to millions of citizens that have benefitted by that legislation.Stokes' 30-year career in Congress is the most compelling evidence, Mr. Speaker, available of why we should not have term limits. Only a few, in fact, only 120 Members of this body in 200 years, have served 30 years or better. So Stokes is in a distinct, unique class of people. In fact, in the 200-year history of this Congress, only 10,000 Members have served in this body. So it is an honor for him to be in that elite group of 115 distinguished individuals.I do not think that anybody ought to limit the number of years that a person can serve here if his constituents want that person to represent them.Mr. Stokes, as I said earlier, has become a legend, as it was predicted. He has contributed in a most meaningful way to enhance the image and importance of this institution. Those contributions have been exceptional, singular, uncommon, as has been related by the ranking member of this committee. Stokes has been the author of numerous education programs, including the TRIO program.Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, let me say the term ``power'' is frequently used loosely and without knowledge of its real significance. Seldom do the users of the expression bother to contemplate that all sources of power are limited inasmuch as they are to some degree dependent on other sources of power. But for Lou Stokes, some sources are more real, more independent, and more indispensable than others. He has often said that the two most devastating kinds of power are economic and political, asserting that if you have one, you are respected, if you have both, you are feared, but if you have neither, you are exploited.Stokes comprehends the theory of power and its imposing function. He has successfully exercised his power on the House Committee on Appropriations to achieve a degree of equitable balance between the have's and the have not's, and I am proud to say that I am counted amongst his friends.Perhaps the best and most succinct summary of who and what Lou Stokes is about can be found in a statement celebrating his two decades in elective office. It stated:This twenty-year milestone in the United States Congress gives us pause to reflect on Lou Stokes, the man, a legend in the making. As he continues to make his mark in history, he improves the quality of our lives by example and effort.The one person who has stood next to the Congressman in this noble endeavor for considerably more than this 30 year stretch, is his lovely charming and understanding wife, Jay Stokes. She has been the pillar of strength behind his uncharted excursion into the field of law and untiring venture into the weightiness of politics. She has raised their four children--Shelly, Chuck, Angie, and Lori--and managed to do it with style and grace.In overcoming his impoverished beginnings, Stokes went on to excel in the Congress and in the legal field. He is held in high esteem by his associates in both professions. Before election to Congress, he was a celebrated practicing attorney in Cleveland, once arguing before the Supreme Court the landmark ``stop and frisk'' case of Terry vs. Ohio which is taught in every law school in the country.The term ``power'' is frequently used loosely and without knowledge of its real significance. Seldom do users of the expression bother to contemplate that all sources of power are limited inasmuch as they are to some degree dependent upon sources of power. But for Lou Stokes, some sources are more real, more independent, and more indispensable than others. He has often said that the two most devastating kinds of power are economic and political, asserting that ``if you have one, you are respected; if you have both, you are feared; but, if you have neither, you are exploited.''Stokes comprehends the theory of power and its imposing function. He has successfully exercised his power on the House Appropriations Committee to achieve a degree of equitable balance between the ``haves'' and the ``have-nots''.While Stokes has vigorously pursued an agenda that respects and appreciates the vital needs of the nation, he has not ignored the critical problems hampering the growth and prosperity of the black community. He has implemented new ideas and promoted a new direction in the areas of legislation dealing with the education of the African-American population.Stokes has used his position on the Appropriations Committee to increase funding for Head Start, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Teacher Training and Vocational Education. Recognizing the critical need to prepare students for a highly technological world, he secured federal funds to support and strengthen math and science programs.Stokes has manifested critical leadership in prodding the House Appropriations Committee to expand its funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Through his role as a seasoned member of the committee, he has used his authority with decisiveness in protecting financial securing of these institutions which are vitally important to higher education of the African American populace.Congressman Stokes is a respected champion on the health care front. He has utilized his assignment on the House Appropriations Committee to sponsor critical health care issues. As a result of his strong leadership, funding for diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and AIDS has significantly increased.Since 1977, Stokes has chaired the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. This policy-making body has been effective in helping to define and to shape the nation's health agenda. Under Stokes' leadership, the CBC braintrust has fought for improved health care delivery for minorities and under-served populations; enhanced education and outreach activities; and increased minority representation in the health professions, including biomedical research.Stokes has been instrumental in promoting community health interests, increasing minority manpower in health care professions, and providing federal funds for the enhancement of programs at medical schools.Congressional leadership has bestowed superb accolades on Stokes by having named him to prominent and prestigious positions of heady responsibility. He was appointed by Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill on March 8, 1977 to chair the committee investigating the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.Speaker ``Tip'' O'Neill also named him to chair the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (Ethics Committee). And in February 1983, Stokes named by Speaker Jim Wright to chair the Select Committee on Intelligence.The founding of the Congressional Black Caucus is demonstrative of the vision shown by Stokes almost immediately upon his arrival to Congress. He wasted no time seeking to establish a forum for articulating the concerns of Black Americans. He, along with several others, decided that becuase of the nearly equal ideological division in the House between liberal and conservatives--Democrats and Northern Republicans allied against Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats--the nine black members of the House of Representatives comprised a voting block sufficient to constitute the balance of power.Members of the CBC were determined to seize the moment, to confront racial injustice, to fight for economic equity and to raise other issues long ignored and too little debated. Stokes gave extraordinary leadership in the formative days of the movement and was elected the second chairman of the Caucus in 1972.stokes chaired hearings on the assassinations of president john f. Stoke's objectivity is demonstrated by his leadership of the assassinations committee. The Committee identified four main issues to be investigated:1. Who was or were the assassin(s) of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?2. Did the assassin(s) have any aid or assistance either before or after the assassinations?3. Did the agencies and departments of the U.S. Government adequately perform their duties and functions in protecting the two slain leaders?4. Given the evidence the committee uncovered, is the amendment of existing legislation appropriate?Stokes oversaw the 18-month investigation which ended in December 1978 with twenty-seven volumes of hearings and a final report containing recommendations for administrative and legislative reform. He performed admirably and impressively at the nationally televised committee hearings.Although Stokes is a very serious minded person, there is a lighter, more common side to the legislator. In addition to having a keen sense of humor, he often gets involved in humorous situations. One such instance occurred one night when he, Jay, Carol and I were dining at a Thai restaurant in Maryland. After carefully perusing a menu that was not familiar to any of us, we all ordered something different. When Stokes had consumed about half of his order, he observed that the meal did not seem like the one he had ordered. Complaining to the waiter, he was told that he was correct. The waiter said that they were all out of the meal Stokes had ordered and this one was a replacement.,2015-03-17 19:10:52.878777,2015-03-17 19:10:52.878777,House,DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999,1998-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-23/html/CREC-1998-07-23-pt1-PgH6219-2.htm,100,44,144,H6219-H6277,C000488,mr. clay
2687,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and appreciate the opportunity to be able to participate in his special order on this very important question.As the gentleman knows, we are here today to illustrate why the vote we will cast on the Republican tax cut plan this week is one of the most important votes that will be taken in this Congress and for many years.When the House takes up the Republican vision of tax relief, we will oppose it because well over half the benefits go to the top, or wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers.We ask the Republicans to simply listen to the words of the people that they profess they are helping, the hardworking, middle-class taxpayers instead of wealthy contributors and corporate special interests.There is a different way to provide tax relief than rewarding traders of stocks and bonds for a bull market brought on by the Democrats' economic recovery. The Democratic tax cut targets tax relief to the people who are raising children and agonizing over how they will be able to send them to college when they are ready.The Democratic tax cut targets tax relief to people who are selling their homes, the biggest investment, I might add, for most middle income taxpayers.The Democratic tax cut gives tax relief to families who are struggling to keep the family business and the family farm in the family to succeeding generations, and the Democratic tax cut responsibly holds down the cost of this targeted tax relief that our children and our families will not have to bear the burden for paying for it later. We do not want to explode the deficit down the road as we once did. We want to keep the budget in balance.Beyond all of the complex statutory language that goes into the Tax Code, the spread sheets and the revenue estimates from congressional scorekeepers, we have to ask ourselves what this bill is really for, what is it all about? Is it an economic experimentation giving the wealthy, who already have a huge advantage over middle class taxpayers, the lion's share of the benefit with the hopes that it would trickle down eventually to the rest of the people in the economy, or should it be about offering average ordinary taxpayers a helping hand by putting more money back in their pockets to raise their kids and send them to college?I think the Democratic tax cut is fair because it targets tax cuts on those who need them the most. More than two-thirds of the Democratic tax cut goes to the truly struggling middle income and lower income families who make less than $57,000 a year.In sharp contrast, 57 percent of the tax cut in the Republican bill goes to the top 5 percent; that is, people making over a $109,000 a year. Let me repeat that: 57 percent, more than two-thirds, in fact 66 percent, of our tax cut goes to families who earn less than $57,000 a year, but 57 percent of the Republican tax cut goes to the top 5 percent of wage earners; that is, people earning over a $109,000 a year.The Democratic tax cut alternative is better for working families, as the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Pallone] has said. For example, it targets the per child tax credit on hard pressed families making less than $57,000 a year and ensures that millions more children will qualify for the credit than under the GOP bill.The Democratic tax cut is better for education. It provides $37 billion in education tax credits for working families compared to only $22 billion in the GOP bill and larger education tax credits for millions of working families than the GOP plan.The Democratic tax cut alternative is better for the deficit. Unlike the GOP bill, the Democratic alternative does not have a lot of backloaded provisions such as the indexing of capital gains and backloaded individual retirement accounts that will explode the deficit in later years.The Republican rush to a vote this week leaves precious little opportunity for the American people to react to these competing visions for tax relief, but before we cast this vote I really believe that every Member should engage in a dialog with our constituents and ask them how these two very different tax plans would help them. If we would do that, I am confident that the majority of those in the middle class and at the lower income levels who comprise 90 percent of America's taxpayers will find that the Democratic tax cut plan offers the greatest tax relief for America's middle-income families.Now before I end I would like to pay attention for a moment here to a gentleman who lives in my district. His name is Ben Naes. He is an impressive young man from Barnhart, MO. He is a 21-year-old student. He graduated just a couple of weeks ago from Jefferson Community College. He majored in chemistry and hopes to pursue a career in either chemistry or biochemistry. He worked his way through community college over the past 2 years with the support of his parents, his father Roger, who is an iron worker, and his mother Tony is a retailer at Grandpa's Department Store. His parents are very proud of him, as they should be because he worked summers as an iron worker's apprentice, and while his parents financially supported him he earned a 3.9 grade point average and recently was accepted to Southeast Missouri State University so he could go on and get his 4 year degree.The question we ask tonight is how would Ben Naes fare under the two tax proposals that will be before the House later this week. As a community college student Ben's family paid $1,500 a year for 30 credit hours to the community college. Under the Democratic alternative tax cut proposal Ben's family would have received $1,100 a year tax credit this year if it had been in effect to defray Ben's education costs. The Republican plan would have only given $750 a year credit. So under the Democratic plan, $1,100 for Ben Naes and his family; under the Republican plan, $750 for Ben Naes and his family. The Democratic plan would mean that Ben's family would have more money for school supplies, expenses and ultimately more time to spend together as a family because they would not have to go out and earn that $600 difference.Now when Ben begins attending Southwest Missouri State this next fall, his family will pay $2,900 a year for tuition to that State institution. Under the democratic tax cut proposal Ben's family would receive a tax credit of $580 toward that $2,900 of tuition, but under the Republican plan there would be no benefit at all because, as the gentleman knows, under the Republican plan there is no help for the third and fourth years of college, only for the first two.Now as a parent of several children who are attending college right now I can tell you that $600 a year is a big deal. It makes a significant impact in paying for higher education and assuring that your child is going to get that much needed educational degree which has a direct benefit in terms of how much money they can earn after college.So the contrast, I would conclude to the gentleman, could not be clearer. For Ben Naes the Democratic bill is much, much better. For community college, for going on to State college, he gets real tangible benefits, as does his family. The Republican bill, much less advantage, and in the third and fourth year of college, nothing, absolutely a big goose egg while people at the top who are earning $200,000 and $300,000 and $400,000 a year would get thousands of dollars of tax benefits that frankly they have not asked for and that certainly they do not need as much as Ben Naes and his family in Barnhart, MO.So the gentleman is, I think, bringing a very clear and cogent and important message tonight in this special order to the American people and our constituents who really need to know the difference between these two competing tax cut visions, the Democratic tax cut or the Republican tax cut, and I certainly hope that we can convince a majority in the House to vote for the Democratic tax cut plan which would be much, much better for my constituents back in the Third District of Missouri.,2015-03-17 19:10:53.033889,2015-03-17 19:10:53.033889,House,DEMOCRATIC TAX CUT PROPOSAL,1997-06-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-24/html/CREC-1997-06-24-pt1-PgH4314.htm,90,2,143,H4314-H4320,G000132,mr. gephardt
2688,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, let me take this means to congratulate the National War College on 60 years of excellence in national security policy and strategic thinking education. On April 5, 2006, I had the privilege to address the Commandant's dinner in celebration of this anniversary and I am proud to share that speech with the Members of the House:Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you. I am honored that you asked me to be your speaker. And thank you, General Peterson for that generous introduction. First, I have to say Congratulations. What you have built here is truly a national treasure. You can be proud, as the entire nation should be, of this school and your product-- because your product literally is the strength of this nation as we anticipate and respond to world events. Among your students and your faculty, you have educated some of the finest strategists this country has ever produced. I was going to give a short speech. But then I thought about the critical time we live in and got excited all over again about National War College. I don't want to take too much time with serious thoughts, but it is important to reflect on our past in order to respond to the challenges ahead. Sixty years ago, it was a novel idea--to create a college that would focus on grand strategy and bring together a diverse student body and faculty--senior officers from all the services and senior officials from the state department and, later, other agencies. This was a place where students were presented with strategic dilemmas, with a curriculum that ``focused on the interrelationship of military and non-military means in the promulgation of national policy.'' In 1946 Ambassador George Kennan, the first deputy for foreign affairs here, explained that in those days of ``transition and uncertainty,'' there was little in the policy world being done on the relation between war and politics. Kennan noted, ``American thinking about foreign policy had been primarily addressed to the problems of peace, and had taken place largely within the frameworks of international law and economics. Thinking about war, confined for the most part to military staffs and institutions of military training, had been directed . . . to technical problems of military strategy and tactics--to the achievement, in short, of victory in purely military terms.'' Kennan saw this school--its curriculum and its student/ faculty interaction--as a home for the development of new strategic thinking at the beginning of the Cold War. Through the years, National War College faculties have done a magnificent job teaching national security policy and strategy. This College's special place among the senior schools of Professional Military Education has been based on your attention to grand strategy. As Lieutenant General Leonard T. Gerow--President of the Board which recommended the War College's formation--said, ``The College is concerned with grand strategy and the utilization of national resources necessary to implement that strategy . . . Its graduates will exercise influence on the formulation of national and foreign policy in both peace and war.'' It has also been based on your insistent attention to academic rigor. And, your excellence has been based on the inclusion, from the beginning, of interagency and international students. These elements of excellence, in the context of a residential program that builds lasting ties between officers of different services, different countries and different agencies, is unmatched anywhere. Congress has been supportive of your continuing advances in all these areas. I guess I don't have to remind you of my role in the Goldwater-Nichols reforms to increase ``jointness'' among the services and my investigations of the Professional Military Education system. But we can't rest here. Keeping your institution relevant and on the sharp edge takes the constant attention of Congress and the Chairman in support of each new Commandant, and Dean, and the faculty. Your graduates test your teaching every day in a very complex environment. Senior decision makers have made some mistakes that have increased the difficulty of their missions. I know the current students review successes and difficulties as case studies so they will be even better prepared. But while today's wars demand our focus, we need to be careful we don't become so myopic that we fail to see the great challenges and opportunities ahead. One challenge is that, with all our advanced technology, when we still have failures. I believe this is because we are ill-equipped intellectually and because we don't work together well enough. Our successes are achieved because our most astute military and civilian leaders understand people, cultures, and root causes of problems or conflicts. And they anticipate opportunities. In Iraq, Afghanistan, the global war on terror, and even with Katrina and beyond, human interactions have caused great uncertainty for our security at home and abroad. Just these few examples show why any success we have is not just a matter of doctrine and technology. We can all think about failures among leaders at transitional periods such as Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg. He failed to grasp the impact on war of the transition from an agricultural to an industrial age. This lesson shows that what might appear to be tactical mistakes are really strategic! And I'm convinced, we are once more at a transitional period in our history just as Kennan was sixty years ago. Today we not only face the continuing transition from the industrial to the information age, but we are also recognizing that adversaries can capitalize on technologies in unanticipated ways. As new technologies have increased the complexity of our world, we see two other phenomena. Our adversaries use tactics we would be familiar with if we studied history. And, with our focus on technology, we must not neglect the critical dimension of human interaction. This brings me to my real point. The challenges and opportunities before us place as great an intellectual demand on our national security professionals as at any time in our history. And while their understanding of the art of war and international relations might be pretty good today, it must be even better tomorrow. And it must be broader. It must be even better integrated across all the instruments of national power. And it must be more expansive to include nontraditional national security partner agencies and departments, as well as more and different foreign partners. Beyond the employment of joint forces, beyond the effort to pursue the newest technologies of the science of warfare, you know that National War College graduates must be prepared not just to adopt technical transformation, but also must understand the art of statecraft as well as war. While I do not pretend to understand the Future Combat System or the avionics of the F-22, I do know they will be useless unless we have wise leaders who know the value of all the instruments of national power and have the skills to use them at the appropriate times and in the appropriate combinations. I know it's easy to measure the increased payloads and speeds brought by new technology. But while it's difficult to quantify the value of a Kennan, a Powell, or a Pace, it's more important than ever to recognize the value of our best strategists. As we used to say about jointness, ``this can't be a pick up game.'' Now, it's our interagency planning and operations, and our focus on a broader definition of national security that must not be ad hoc or ``come as you are.'' What would help? I want to challenge the Services and other agencies, to design systems that deliberately select the right people for the right level of professional education and the right school for strategic studies. They should be able to articulate why they send one person to Air, Naval or Army War College and another to this College or ICAF, or to a Fellowship. At the same time, they need to place a real value on how well their members take on what is taught. Your graduates' future assignments should not only reflect that they went to the premier interagency national security strategy institution. Their selection for command, senior leadership, and interagency positions should be based in greater measure on how well they perform here. Did National War College Distinguished Graduates and outstanding faculty get treated any differently by their Service detailers or their agency human resource directors than those who did not do quite as well, or as those who were not selected for this outstanding education? Perhaps they went back to the very same job they were doing. This is what I mean when I have spoken about the Services taking intellectual performance at PME seriously. This is what I mean when I critique them for not promoting officers who have excelled teaching or studying world affairs and the art of war and politics. Is this impossible? Only if we're wedded to machine age personnel systems. The Services and agencies need information age human resource systems that can recruit, retain, train and educate the innovative people we need in government and the military. And, we need a sufficient number of people in the Services and agencies if we are going to build intellectual capital, fight these wars and prepare for the next catastrophe or conflict. We have to have enough people to be able to send exceptional military and agency leaders to be students or faculty in school assignments. The cost of preparing for the challenges of tomorrow pale in comparison to the price we will pay if we are caught without the cadre of wise leaders we need for the future. You know, whenever I haven written the Chairman, or NDU President or you as Commandants a letter, I have been pretty consistent in my questions. Do you select the right officers and civilians to serve as faculty and in the right balance? Have you kept your faculty to student ratio low with 10-12 students per seminar? Are you emphasizing history, political science and foreign area studies? Does the faculty have these credentials? Do you have the resources to ensure your students are able to conduct field or regional studies? Do your resources enable faculty to contribute to national strategy and policy through research and sabbaticals? Do you stay relevant by using real world and historical case studies? Have you fully integrated your reserve component, civilian and foreign students? To me these are not academic questions, if you will pardon the expression. These are about the character and the continued relevance of this school. Let me be clear. We know that the National War College has no counterpart among civilian universities. Not Harvard, not Princeton, not Stanford--none of them has a faculty, or curriculum or student body remotely comparable. This College must be protected and supported as the elite institution it is. The nation's future security requires it. The quality of the faculty, of the instruction, of the curriculum, of the students must not be compromised. A false choice must never be forced on us between spending on current operations and new military technologies, and investing in the education of our future premier national strategists. For sixty years the National War College has been the crown jewel of Professional Military Education. Since the days when President Harry Truman sat in student seminars to learn about the Soviet Union, this College has been the place where strategic thinking has been nurtured, taught and refined. At a historic moment of great challenge and peril George Kennan, worked in this building, to formulate the containment strategy that ultimately won the Cold War without a nuclear exchange. Today, at another moment of great challenge, the need for strategic direction and thinking could not be greater. The price of failure is far too high. We have to get it right. We have to have wise people, with the right education, in the right positions, to think through these challenges and take action in concert. When you think about all the political debates, the expedient compromises, and the resource trade-offs that take place in this town each day, it's a miracle that a college of this quality has been able to survive and prosper within the larger bureaucratic confines of the government. In a more immediate sense, I have always been concerned that bureaucracies can kill even the healthiest intellectual organization. A college such as this can decline and die if bureaucracies and administrative arms bloat while they cut corners, dumb down, impose numbing uniformity, enshrine group think, standardize mediocrity or gorge themselves on the resources meant to be spent on the real stuff of education--the interaction between small groups of faculty and students wrestling with the profound issues of the day. The National War College has always embodied something unique. As I look at you leaders of this college during different eras of war and peace, I sense a continuity of intellectual engagement and energy in these historic halls. It is called excellence. Why is it here? Yes, you have an outstanding faculty, and superior students, an ever adapting curricula and your wonderful location here in Washington. But the key, from the beginning--the genius of General Eisenhower's vision--is that experienced professionals from various backgrounds and come together, over an extended period of time, to learn from each other, and to tackle problems together in an environment that fosters understanding. This is one institution that has had no agenda other than to make wise and thoughtful leaders. In the current atmosphere of partisan tensions, this College remains a refuge from the bureaucratic skirmishes and wars. As the first War College Commandant, Admiral Harry T. Hill explained, his intention was to ``make the students ponder'', to give the students practical problems upon which to think and arrive at individual conclusions. This is a safe space for men and women to engage each other in the search for a better understanding of each others' agencies and departments. They can gain a true appreciation of the character and conduct of war, the complexity of strategy, and the utility of the diplomatic, political and economic instruments of state. Your product is strategists. They are still critical to our future. I can see this in your graduates . . . General Pace, our Chairman; General Martin Dempsey on the ground now in Iraq; David Sedney, our first senior State Department officer in Afghanistan after 9/11 and now deputy chief of mission in China; Buzz Mosley, Chief of Staff of the Air Force . . . generals, ambassadors, foreign military officers, and interagency leaders. Even one of our newest Armed Services Committee staffers, Lorry Fenner, is a former member of your faculty and a National War College graduate. I could go on and on . . . This is a proud tradition and serves as the foundation for the next 60 years ahead. I hope the War College will continue to lead the way in inter-agency and inter-service strategic education. As we broaden our definition of the national security community to include homeland defense and increased international cooperation, I hope that the War College model and experience can be used to broaden government's approach to our nation's challenges. George Kennan, typing away in his office right next door to this room, charted a strategy to meet a past threat . . . a policy that endured and was adapted, through Administrations of both parties. You all have been the watchful guardians of this heritage. I want to challenge you tonight continue to work with us in Congress and at this College to think about how to improve interagency planning and operations to defeat our adversaries and to capitalize on opportunities. Lend your wisdom to the significant questions we face today--should we be working on a National Security Act for 2007 or 2009? How can we adapt a Goldwater-Nichols type reform to the interagency process? These are only two of the topics we wrestle with. You can see how significant they are and imagine the sustained, long term effort they will require. So, we enjoy a celebration tonight, but tomorrow we must start again to renew and reinvigorate this great project of creating national security strategists. Given your history, and the imperative for the future, I am confidant this College's faculty and students are up to this challenge. Thank you for including me in your celebration. I welcome your continued engagement on these issues.,2015-03-17 19:10:53.290077,2015-03-17 19:10:53.290077,Extensions,NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE CELEBRATES 60TH ANNIVERSARY,2006-05-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-05-02/html/CREC-2006-05-02-pt1-PgE675-4.htm,50,0,152,E675-E677,S000465,mr. skelton

2690,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Foreign Operations bill, and I thank the managers of the bill for putting forward an excellent measure.I have a couple of areas I wish to speak about at some length, but let me give the framework in which I will talk about it. I come to the floor a lot--I spoke this morning about military action, but I come to the floor to talk about intelligence. We are, at least in my thesis, in a worldwide war against those who have declared us to be their enemy. It is an ideological war. I think, by any stretch of the imagination, most people realize that a war against this kind of enemy is only 20 percent kinetic, it is 80 percent economic/educational.What we are doing in this bill some people object to--spending money on foreign operations--because they think, oh, it is do-gooderism; it is trying to make us feel good, helping people in the world. Well, clearly we are carrying out an important mission to help less developed countries throughout the world. That is certainly one of the areas where America's generosity has always shown through. Our private charities are even more robust than what we do through government.I continue to hear people back home saying: If we just cut out foreign aid, we could do this and we could do that. But foreign aid is minuscule. I, frankly, think it ought to be more. If we are going to turn the tide against those who are committed to radical views, to misusing and misinterpreting their religion to declare war on us, we have to deal with them not only kinetically when they pick up arms or when they threaten to bomb us, but we have to help create the conditions in those countries where people are not driven to earn a small amount of money for planting a roadside bomb or an IED or even get a little more for their family by committing suicide in a terrorist attack.There are some things we can do through this bill that I think are very important to connect with those countries which view us with suspicion. We can help change the attitude--not of everybody; not of the committed mufsidoon. Those are people who, in the name of Islam, kill innocents, men and women, fellow Muslims. They are too often called jihadists. They are not for jihad. Jihad is a legitimate self-fulfillment and improvement by Muslims. They commit hirabah, which is the terrible form of violence these Muslims commit. We need to show people in the countries from which they come that America can be a force for good.There are a couple of things that are very important. No. 1 is establishing and improving educational exchanges. No. 2 is economic assistance to help them build their economy. I will talk about that later. No. 3 is getting Americans on the ground.I have traveled to a lot of countries, and I have spent a lot of time in Southeast Asia. They keep telling me that the best emissaries the United States has are Peace Corps members, the Peace Corps members who have been here, and those in other volunteer organizations--if they come with a church, if they come with a charity or a nongovernmental organization, if they come with the volunteers in the financial services program. When Americans come, even as tourists, they can make a difference.I wish to talk just a minute about the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps, as I said, is one of the important weapons we have, not only to help them understand us but to help us understand them. At no other time in this Nation's history has the work of the Peace Corps and its volunteers been more vital or valued. Peace Corps volunteers are the good face of America in the developing world. They provide practical, hands-on experience while spreading compassion and good will, which is vital in winning the hearts and minds of people all over the world. The United States is no longer the only game in town, and we can no longer take for granted that countries will line up to want to support the United States.China, for example, with over 1 trillion U.S. dollars, is aggressively engaging in courting countries all over the world on economic, diplomatic, and cultural fronts, frankly shutting us out, moving us out of the game by establishing what the Chinese call their Confucius Institutes, thus promoting their language and culture through internationally affiliated institutes. The Chinese Ministry of Education estimates that by the year 2010 there will be approximately 100 million people worldwide learning Chinese as a foreign language. And it plans to set up 100 more. They will be learning Chinese, not English.I ask, why are we reducing and not increasing our efforts to promote American values, our culture, our way of life? As I said, to fight the war on terror, our efforts are 20 percent kinetic, 80 percent public diplomacy--international exchanges, education, aid, and community development. In other words, I believe that putting more sandals on the ground will prevent having to put boots on the ground in the future to fight militarily what we could have won economically with education and diplomacy beforehand.Only about 20 percent of Peace Corps volunteers are serving in predominantly Muslim countries. There are far too few. In key areas, there are just not enough. Why? We just do not have the money. The money stayed stable, and costs have gone up. We have been declining in Peace Corps participation. Why is it important to have them in Muslim countries? Because they provide alternatives to the Wahabist view of life, financed too often by our Saudi Arabian friends. They are too often promoting the Salafists' radical agenda--barbaric ideologies, trying to reach impressionable Muslims.Numerous accomplishments have been achieved over the past 6 years by our American volunteers, and the Peace Corps is poised to meet not only the growing demands from interested countries but from thousands of Americans who want to serve as well. I believe the Peace Corps should obtain its full request in 2008 in order to expand opportunities to enter these countries, vitally important countries in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, and I hope we will get a more robust request from the administration next year. It should not be hindered in expanding the number of volunteers in countries where the Peace Corps already exists and is advancing American ideals and building good will. Budget tightening has already occurred at many posts, and program closures are likely without additional funds.Many of our diplomats and host country officials say that the Peace Corps is the most effective and cost-efficient U.S. agency in getting a better view of America.I look forward to working with my colleagues in the conference committee. I hope we will be able to restore the President's full request for the Peace Corps. It is an investment in an effort vitally important to improving the lives of those in the developing world.I also wish to talk about another initiative. I have been on the floor talking about it a long time; that is, effective grass roots development for agriculture in Afghanistan. Agriculture is the main building block of the Afghan economy, but it has suffered from disinvestment and neglect. Over 70 percent of Afghans live in rural areas and derive their income from agriculture. Yet the public and private support infrastructure for agriculture is yet to be rebuilt.I talked to some Missouri farmers--I will discuss it more later--who were over there with our National Guard. They tell us that they believe the Afghans could move a tremendous leap forward if we got them 19th century, not 21st century, not 20th century, but 19th century tools and equipment because they are that far behind.I thank the managers of the bill. They have used in this bill $20 million for USAID to set up and develop a nationwide agriculture extension system. It would establish and execute a strategy through a consortium of U.S. land grant universities, integrating the program into Afghanistan institutions, guided by local councils, comprising community, private sector, and government education leaders. Our U.S. education extension service transformed American agriculture over the last hundred years, and it can do a lot to improve the livelihood of the people in Afghanistan and counter the other influences, such as the cultivation of poppies for the drug trade.Unfortunately, we have given money to USAID in the past, and it has been largely ineffective. USAID has refused to set up an extension system in Afghanistan. They continue to rely on large, DC-based contractors who apparently have had no impact. They lack that expertise and capacity-building know-how and expertise which will create sustainable development.Over 5 years and hundreds of millions of dollars later, after USAID has been spinning its wheels, Afghanistan now accounts for 92 percent of the world's opium supply. I recognize USAID and the Department of State are large bureaucracies that cannot operate as effectively as the military can in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the community development efforts they are tasked with are paramount to establish a strong economy that will allow the Afghan farmers and the Afghan people an alternative to opium production. When I was in Iraq, for example, I observed our warfighters taking action and picking up the mantle where State and USAID's hands were tied.In Ramadi, we saw the marines, after they had pacified Ramadi, went in and rebuilt the Blue Mosque, the absolutely central Sunni mosque for that entire region. There was a tremendous amount of goodwill created, showing them we supported their religion.In Afghanistan, a member of my staff, a month ago, returned from Nangarhar Province with members of the Missouri National Guard. As a result of my working with the Guard and what we saw on the ground and the fact that the President, Hamid Karzai, had asked for extension service assistance but USAID was not able to produce it, I asked the National Guard to send an agricultural development team over to see what could be done. They came back with a very promising response.The team and subsequent others we hope will be established by the Department of Defense through the National Guard will be composed of citizen soldiers who come, in their civilian lives, from farming, agribusiness, and construction trades. Each AG team will have extension service experts--whether it is in soil or meat technology or other things that have been identified as pressing needs. They are going to focus on more efficient use of irrigation, crop rotation, cold storage, harvesting, processing, and agribusiness. They will not just be giving farmers seeds, they will be building real, long-term relationships and capacity-building that will sustain agriculture in Afghanistan, to bring it into the 19th and even into the 20th century. They will be doing so in a place where building trust with the populace is paramount.From my time as Governor, I have always been impressed with not only the capacity and the ability and dedication of our National Guard throughout the United States but their flexibility. The National Guard structure, capabilities, and the skill-set of the citizen soldiers in the Army are uniquely positioned to execute a position that many others are incapable of fully executing. I hope the USAID and State Department will follow the lead of its Department of Defense cohorts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As I said, 80 percent of the war on terror is nonkinetic--agricultural development, education exchanges, Peace Corps volunteers, and public diplomacy. If USAID continues to rely on giving large chunks of money to cumbersome contractors in its foreign aid, it will fail, and I will see if I can convince my colleagues to choose another route.Efforts in Afghanistan, like the land grant extension initiative and the agricultural development teams, are models for how we should be conducting the nonkinetic war we must fight against those who vowed continuing war against us and the way of life we espouse.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:10:53.912518,2015-03-17 19:10:53.912518,Senate,DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008,2007-09-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-09-06/html/CREC-2007-09-06-pt1-PgS11144.htm,131,69,153,S11144-S11185,B000611,mr. bond
2691,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my friend, Hila ``Dutch'' Newman. In Missouri, Democrats from every region and every level of government seek her counsel, value her judgment, and understand that her word is her bond. Over the years her leadership, civic pride, integrity and commitment to our community have fostered a deep respect by all who know her. Dutch has a gift of uniting people in common cause. She personifies how one person can make a significant difference in the lives of others.On September 6, 2001 friends of Dutch Newman will gather to pay special tribute to her. A foundation in her honor will be initiated with an objective to provide innovative voter education and registration opportunities, as well as scholarship funding for our youth. The Dutch Newman Voter Education and Scholarship Foundation will become another facet of her legacy, and have a lasting impact on our community. The mission of the foundation is derived from her own, providing today's youth with unique voter education and registration opportunities and scholarships so they will be better able to participate in our democracy. Dutch epitomizes the citizen that President Kennedy sought when in his Inaugural Address he said, ``And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.``Dutch Newman has served in every facet of Democratic politics and always brings sound judgment, insight and perspective to her work. She presently holds the following offices: President of the Westport Landing Democratic Club; President of the State of Missouri Federation of Women's Democratic Clubs; and Vice Chairwoman for the Jackson County Democratic Committee. She serves as a member of: the Democratic State Committee and their Executive Board; Committeewoman for the 5th Ward in Jackson County; Chairperson of State House District 38; and Secretary for the 5th Congressional District. Dutch was the first woman to be appointed by a Governor to sit on the committee for the Senatorial Redistricting of the State of Missouri. She was also the Kansas City Coordinator for Senator Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign in 1968, and Missouri Coordinator for the National Campaign Conference for Democratic Women in Washington, D.C. She has been a Missouri Delegate at the National Democratic Convention for six presidential elections. Her work has not gone unnoticed, especially her grassroots organizing, as she has been recognized by the Jackson County Democratic Party with the Harry S. Truman Award, as well as Woman of the Year Award presented by the Women's Fifth District Democratic Club, now entitled the ``Dutch'' Newman Woman of the Year Award.An article in today's edition of ``The Kansas City Star'' details many of the other aspects of Dutch's life, including her devotion to her children and grandchildren, and her service to our community outside politics, and I ask that it be made a part of today's Record following my statement. Dutch was one of the original founders of the Volker Neighborhood Homes Association, and is a member of: the Daughters of Westport, the Westport Historical Society, Neighborhood Crime Prevention; and the Guardian Angel Altar society. In recognition of her dedication and commitment to the quality of life in Kansas City, Mayor Wheeler presented her with a certificate of appreciation and proclaimed October 5, 1974 as ``Dutch'' Newman Day in Kansas City, Missouri. Her work with people with HIV and AIDS was recognized by a certificate of Appreciation from the National Association of People with Aids.The Dutch Newman Voter Education and Scholarship Foundation will be a constant reminder of the ideals she represents. Through this foundation young people will gain an appreciation for our country's government and become active citizens in the electoral process. Dutch Newman has accepted the challenges of life, conquered adversity, sacrificed for her family, and become a role model for our citizens, inspiring future generations to take an active role in their community. Thank you, Dutch for all you do and for your valued friendship. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring a Missouri treasure, Hila ``Dutch'' Newman.If you're a Democrat in Kansas City and want to run for a political office, then you better go Dutch. Going Dutch has little to do with money. It has everything to do with grass-roots politics and the woman who epitomizes it, Hila ``Dutch'' Newman. Newman, a force behind Democrat--and a few Republican-- candidates since the 1940s, will be honored at a special tribute Thursday night at the Kansas City Marriott Downtown. More than 500 people are expected to attend. The event's list of honorary hosts is a virtual who's who of past and present politicians. And whether they were seeking office in Kansas City, Jefferson City or Washington, Newman helped elect them all. ``Her reputation was that of a very effective worker who could deliver the vote for the Democratic party in the precincts she served,'' said Former Kansas City Mayor Charles Wheeler. Those precincts include the Country Club Plaza, Westport and Volker neighborhoods. Newman has a direct method of finding the candidates she trusts, then working earnestly knocking on doors, making phone calls and printing thousands of sample ballots to pass out to voters. Besides the tribute to Newman, a voter education scholarship foundation has been established in her honor. The foundation will provide voter education programs for youth and eventually will offer scholarships for students studying politics. ``I can't recall another event like this,'' said political and communication consultant Mary O'Halloran, an organizer of Thursday's event. ``Not a tribute to a political and community activist who has never served as an officeholder. ``The phrase I've been hearing over and over is that she's a legend in her own time,'' she said. ``They don't know of anybody else who has had the passion for succeeding and winning and at the same time have compassion for people.'' Former Kansas City Mayor Richard L. Berkley, a Republican, holds Newman in high regard. ``She's so active and involved,'' Berkley said, ``She's willing to work hard for those she wants elected to public office.'' U.S. Sen Jean Carnahan of Missouri said: ``Dutch proves one person can make a difference.'' Newman's roots are simple. She learned the gift of getting along with people and developed her sharp intuition while pouring beer at the Westport tavern owned by her father, Harry Bucher. While tending bar during World War II, Newman volunteered for the Civil Defense Program and was charged with planning a blackout test for Westport. Her first door-to-door effort was successful except for one glitch. As she drove around a darkened Westport with a Civil Defense Program official, Newman noticed a lone light coming from her third-floor apartment. She cringed. ``He said, `Dutch, isn't that your apartment building?' '' Newman returned home and errantly turned on the light. ``I could have killed him,'' she said. ``My apartment was the only one with a light on.'' George Aylward, who ran the influential Kansas City political club Democracy Inc., was impressed by Newman's ability to organize. He asked for her help with a candidate for Jackson County-assessor in the 1944 election. Newman campaigned through the local neighborhoods and picked up quite a few votes at her father's tavern. Aylward's candidate won big. Just like that, her career in politics took off. She worked for the club for several years with Aylward as her mentor. Eventually, she formed her own group, the Westport Landing Democratic Club. ``I really had a great instinct for whether or not they were in it for the people or for themselves,'' she said of her ability to back successful candidates. She also had a City Hall post: supervisor of the Commercial Recreation Department which oversaw things such as liquor licenses and massage parlors. In 1965, then-Gov. Warren Hearnes appointed Newman a fee agent in the Raytown license bureau, a post she had for nearly a decade. After that, she worked as Jackson County's supervisor of liquor control. In the 1960s and 1970s, women were scarce in back room political circles. But at a 2 a.m. strategy session at a club called the Green Duck, there was Newman alongside Bruce Watkins, Leon Jordan and Alex Presta. Newman is more than a fountain of good advice for politicians. She's also full of good stories. Like the time she was passing out campaign literature and a man answered the door naked. ``I said, `Here, read this and get inside before you freeze your rear off,' '' she recalled with a laugh. Or the time Newman and her sister, Sue Lawson, were in line at the 1976 Democratic convention in New York. As Secret Service agents checked the entering delegates ahead of them, Lawson nudged Newman. ``She whispers to me that she has a gun in her purse,'' Newman said, adding that her sister worked for the prosecutor's office. ``It was legal (for her) to carry them, but why she had one, I don't know.'' Newman decided they should inform the agents. ``I guess I should have phrased it better because in seconds there were 10 men surrounding us,'' she said. ``They literally picked us up by the shoulders and dragged us out of there.'' At the police station, Newman attempted to reach someone from Clarence Kelley, a former Kansas City police chief, then head of the FBI. Soon after, the women--minus Then there was the time she was in the hospital during the Gerald Ford-Jimmy Carter presidential race. ``The nurse comes in and says, `Mrs. Newman, I think this is a prank, but there's a guy on the phone who says he is Jimmy Carter,' '' Newman recalled. Indeed it was Carter, wanting to make sure Newman was OK. ``I was in the hospital another time and (George) McGovern called me,'' Newman remembered with a sheepish grin. She whispered, ``I really didn't like him that much.'' On a visit to Kansas City in his run for the White House, Vice President Al Gore stopped his motorcade when he saw Newman standing on the lawn of Penn Valley Community College. He got out of the limousine and ran over to give her a hug. Newman hasn't won all her battles. She backed Joseph P. Teasdale when he lost his second bid at governor to Kit Bond. Carter lost to Ronald Reagan. She couldn't prevent the closing of her neighborhood school at the Guardian Angels Church. But even in defeat, she set herself apart by staying loyal, several politicians said. ``Even if their ship was sinking,'' Newman said, ``I stayed with them.'' Newman once filed for a seat in the Missouri legislation but later withdrew. Once, she was approached to run for lieutenant governor. Among the reasons she declined was her family. ``I was sitting at home eating dinner with the family and I remember thinking, `I can't leave this for four or five days a week,' '' she said. Daughter Michele Newman said Newman always managed to be the consummate mother, even while staying busy in politics. ``My sisters and I always felt blessed to have such an incredible mom,'' she said. ``We were reflecting and it's amazing that first and foremost was us three girls and our father. We were always No. 1.'' ``She was the coach for our girls volleyball team at Guardian Angels . . . she was always the room mother at school,'' Michele Newman said. ``It's been incredible having her as a mother.'' The human side of Newman is what neighbors notice most. Tim Mulvany remembered his real estate agent telling him about Newman when he moved to her block in 1979. ``A week went by and there she was at the door,'' he said. ``She immediately included us in everything.'' Mulvany discovered Newman's political savvy in the first Kansas City election in which he voted. He noticed that Newman backed everybody he was voting for. He printed up a special campaign sign for the next election. It read: ``Whoever Dutch votes for.'' Neighbor Joe McKenna said Newman is the first to help with any neighborhood problem. ``If you need anything it seems like you always end up calling Dutch,'' he said. ``There's a lot of people who don't even know she's helped them.'' McKenna said Newman is always quick to help a neighbor whether it is providing a ride to the doctor's office or help with a utility bill. ``One time a little boy on the street got his bike stolen,'' McKenna said. ``By noon, there was a brand new bike on that boy's porch.'' McKenna smiled. ``That's Dutch.'',2015-03-17 19:10:54.188707,2015-03-17 19:10:54.188707,Extensions,HONORING DUTCH NEWMAN,2001-09-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-09-05/html/CREC-2001-09-05-pt1-PgE1587.htm,114,0,147,E1587-E1588,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2692,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Sen. Harkin to establish the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to support fundamental agricultural research of the highest quality. I present this to begin a critical discussion about how we are going to ensure the United States capitalizes on new technology to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of our agricultural production.We remain the world leader in food and fiber production. We do it safely and through technology and the hard work of the American farmer. In the past half century, the number of people fed by a single U.S. farm has grown from 19 to 129. Our farmers and farm leaders are on the cutting edge of developing new technology. And we have seen the innovations continue to come down the pike. This has made it possible for one farmer to feed 129 people.In addition, we export $60 billion worth of agricultural products, and we do so at less cost and at less harm to the environment than any of our competitors around the world, again, because of new practices, diligence on the part of farmers, and new technology.In a world that has a decreasing amount of soil available for cultivation, we have a growing population and we still have 800 million children who are hungry or malnourished throughout the world. Unless we maximize technology and new practices, production will continue to overtax the world's natural resources.Many people legitimately have raised concerns regarding new diseases and pests and related food safety issues. And they are growing. The ability of U.S. agriculture producers to maintain our world leadership in this environment is only as solid as our willingness to commit to forward-looking investments.Now, we also know from past experience that with new technology the doors are being opened to novel new uses of renewable agricultural products in the fields of energy, medicine, and industrial products. In the future, we can make our farm fields and farm animals factories for everyday products, fuels, and medicines in a way that is efficient and better preserves our natural resources. Advances in the life sciences have come about, such as genetics, proteomics, and cell and molecular biology. They are providing the base for new and continuing agricultural innovations.It was only about a dozen years ago that farmers in Missouri came to me to tell me about the potential that genetic engineering and plant biotechnology had for improving the production of food, and doing so with less impact on the environment, providing more nutritious food. Since that time, I have had a wonderful, continuing education, not in how it works but what it can do.We know now, for example, that in hungry areas of the world as many as half a million children go blind from Vitamin A deficiency, and maybe a million die from this deficiency. Through plant biotechnology, the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and others have developed Golden Rice, taking a gene from the sunflower, a beta-carotene gene, and they enrich the rice. The Golden Rice now has that Vitamin A, and that is going to make a significant difference in dealing with malnutrition.We also know that in many areas of the world, where agricultural production has overtaxed the land, where drought has cut the production, where virus has plagued production, the way we can make farmers self-sufficient and restore the farm economy in many of these countries, is through plant biotechnology. But this is just the beginning. This legislation I am introducing today seeks to lay the foundation for tremendous advances in the future.This legislation stems from findings and recommendations produced by a distinguished group of scientists working on the Agricultural Research, Economics and Education Task Force, which I was honored to be able to include in the 2002 farm bill. The distinguished task force was led by Dr. William H. Danforth, of St. Louis, the brother of our former distinguished colleague, Senator Jack Danforth. Dr. Bill Danforth has a tremendous reputation in science and in education, with a commitment to human welfare and is known worldwide. He was joined by Dr. Nancy Betts, the University of Nebraska; Mr. Michael Bryan, president of BBI International; Dr. Richard Coombe, the Watershed Agricultural Council; Dr. Victor Lechtenbert, Purdue University; Dr. Luis Sequeira, the University of Wisconsin; Dr. Robert Wideman, the University of Arkansas; and Dr. H. Alan Wood, Mississippi State University.I extend my congratulations and my sincere gratitude to Dr. Danforth and his team for providing the basis and the roadmap to ensure we have the mechanisms in place to solve the problems and capitalize on the opportunities in agricultural research. The full report of the task force can be found at .www.ars.usda.gov/research.htmIn summary, that study concludes that it is absolutely necessary we reinvigorate and forward focus our technology to meet the responsibilities of our time. New investment is critical for the world's consumers, the protection of our natural resources, the standard of living for Americans who labor in rural America, and for the well-being of the hungry people and the needy people throughout the world.This legislation is supported by the some 22 Member and Associate Member Societies of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, as well as the Institute of Food Technologists, American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science Society of America, the Council for Agricultural Research, the National Coalition for Food and Agricultural Research, the American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Chicken Council, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, National Turkey Federation, Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.I look forward to pursuing this vision in the 110th Congress. I invite my colleagues who are interested in science and research to review this report, to look at this measure, to join with me and Senator Harkin to talk about moving forward on what I think will be a tremendous opportunity to improve agriculture and its benefits to all our populations.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:10:54.799147,2015-03-17 19:10:54.799147,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2007-03-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-03-22/html/CREC-2007-03-22-pt1-PgS3609.htm,50,22,153,S3609-S3629,B000611,mr. bond
2693,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the achievements of Mr. John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil, a former baseball player and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, and the first African American coach in Major League Baseball. At his death, Buck, as he was affectionately called, was a resident of the Fifth District of Missouri which I am honored to represent. This week, Mr. O'Neil will be inducted into the Missouri Walk of Fame posthumously during a reception as part of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, an event held to honor the achievements of African-Americans who have made significant contributions to Missouri.John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil was born the grandson of slaves in Carrabelle, Florida, on November 13, 1911. He acquired his love for baseball at a young age from his father, who played for the local team when he wasn't working as a foreman in the celery fields. As a teenager, Buck realized that he wanted to do something more with his life, but times were difficult throughout the country during the Great Depression, and he had received little formal education because the local high school was segregated.When his father told him that, ``There is something better, but you can't get it here, you're gonna have to go someplace else,'' Buck made the decision to try his luck as a baseball player in the semiprofessional barnstorming leagues that traveled the entire country. It didn't take him long to attract the attention of the Memphis Red Sox of the Negro American League, who signed him to his first professional contract in 1937. After a year of playing for the Red Sox, Mr. O'Neil's contract was purchased by the Kansas City Monarchs--the team with which he would spend the rest of his playing career.The Monarchs were the most successful team in the history of the Negro Leagues, winning the most titles and producing the best players. While playing for Kansas City, Mr. O'Neil won batting titles in 1940 and 1946 and led his team to a convincing victory in the 1942 Negro World Series. He batted .353 as the Monarchs swept the Homestead Grays, 4-0. He was also selected to play in three Negro American League All-Star Games, and would likely have accomplished more during his playing career had it not been for World War II; Mr. O'Neil dutifully served his country for 2 years by completing a tour in the United States Navy from 1943-1945.Buck stayed with the Monarchs through, the end of the 1955 season, serving both as a player and as the team's manager for the final 8 years of his time in Kansas City, all the while facing the harshness of separation and discrimination in a country that was still segregated. Thanks in part to the significant accomplishments of his Monarchs teammate Jackie Robinson, who broke down racial barriers by joining the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball in 1947, Buck too was able to join a rapidly-integrating MLB as a scout for the Chicago Cubs. In 1962, he became the first African American coach in the Majors. During his storied career with the Cubs, Mr. O'Neil was responsible for the development of many great major leaguers, like Joe Carter, and he also signed two future Hall of Fame players--Lou Brock and Ernie Banks. After 33 years with the Cubs, Buck returned home in 1988 to scout for the Kansas City Royals.Despite his myriad accomplishments on the field as a player, manager, and coach, it is Buck O'Neil's accomplishments off the field that demonstrate his love for the game of baseball and his commitment to the essential role that the Negro Leagues played in the integration of both American sport and American society. In 1990, O'Neil was a leader in the effort to create the Negro League Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. The Museum, located in the historic 18th and Vine district of downtown Kansas City, has excelled for nearly a decade in its mission of educating all Americans about the rich and important history of the Negro Leagues. Buck served as the Board Chairman for the Museum and actively promoted its messages of understanding and triumph over adversity. In addition to his work with the Museum, Mr. O'Neil served as a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee from 1981-2000, working hard to ensure that many of the Negro League players who had been denied entrance into the Major Leagues because of segregation were able to gain a deserved entrance into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.After devoting so many years of his life to promoting the accomplishments of others, many believed that the time for Buck's recognition had finally arrived in the spring of 2006, when he was on a special ballot for entry into the Hall of Fame. Shockingly, the Committee chose not to induct Mr. O'Neil, to the dismay of many--but not Buck. Unaffected by the Hall's decision, he took the high road and offered to speak at the induction ceremony on behalf of those selected, because many of them had passed on. On June 30, 2006, Buck selflessly honored all 17 individuals related to the Negro Leagues who were inducted, giving an inspiring speech and instructing all audience members to hold hands and join him in song. The ovation he received was the loudest and longest of the ceremony.At the time of his death, Buck O'Neil's efforts were focused on the John ``Buck'' O'Neil Education and Research Center. Scheduled for completion in late 2007, the Center will be an expansion of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum devoted to teaching people of all ages many different aspects of the Negro leagues and baseball. The 45,000 square foot facility will house extensive archives and promises to devote much of its space and funding to state-of-the-art technology and programs that will teach many different things to many different people.Throughout his life, he was dedicated to youth and the importance of education, and the effects of his efforts have brought about a more diverse and concerned citizenry throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area and our nation. For these reasons and more, it is indeed an honor and privilege to recognize Mr. John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil at the Missouri Walk of Fame reception, hosted by myself and fellow Missourian, U.S. Representative William Lacy Clay of St. Louis.Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Mr. John ``Buck'' O'Neil, not just to the Kansas City community, but to the entire country at large. He is a true role model, a person who has been dedicated with improving the condition of his fellow man for more than 70 years.,2015-03-17 19:10:55.582704,2015-03-17 19:10:55.582704,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MR.

2694,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,"I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Mikulski, Senator Bennett, and Senator Harkin to establish a division of food and agricultural science within the National Science Foundation to support fundamental agricultural research of the highest quality. I present this to begin a critical discussion that I believe we must have over the next several months and perhaps over the next year or so about how we are going to ensure we capitalize on the technology to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of our agricultural production.We remain the world leader in food and fiber production. We do it safely and through technology and the hard work of the American farmer. In the past half century, the number of people fed by a single U.S. farm has grown from 19 to 129. We have a tremendously innovative agricultural research program. Our farmers, our farm leaders are on the cutting edge of developing new technology. And we have seen the innovations continue to come down the pike. This has made it possible for one farmer to feed 129 people.In addition, we export $60 billion worth of agricultural products, and we do so at less cost and at less harm to the environment than any of our competitors around the world, again, because of new practices, diligence on the part of farmers, and new technology.In a world that has a decreasing amount of soil available for cultivation, we have a growing population and we still have 800 million children who are hungry or malnourished throughout the world. As some have said: A person who is well fed can have many problems. A person who is hungry has but one problem. Unless we maximize technology and new practices, production will continue to overtax the world's natural resources.Many people legitimately have raised concerns regarding new diseases and pests and related food safety issues. And they are growing. The leading competitiveness of our U.S. producers is only as solid as our willingness to invest in forward-looking investments and build upon our historic successes.Now, we also know from past experience that with new technology the doors are being opened to novel new uses of renewable agricultural products in the fields of energy, medicine, and industrial products. In the future, we can make our farm fields and farm animals factories for everyday products, fuels, and medicines in a way that is efficient and better preserves our natural resources. Advances in the life sciences have come about, such as genetics, proteomics, and cell and molecular biology. They are providing the base for new and continuing agricultural innovations.It was only about a dozen years ago that farmers in Missouri came to me to tell me about the potential that genetic engineering and plant biotechnology had for improving the production of food, and doing so with less impact on the environment, providing more nutritious food. Since that time, I have had a wonderful, continuing education, not in how it works but what it can do.We know now, for example, that in hungry areas of the world as many as half a million children go blind from vitamin A deficiency, and maybe a million die from vitamin A deficiency. Well, through plant biotechnology, the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines has developed Golden Rice, taking a gene from the sunflower, a beta-carotene gene, and they enrich the rice. The Golden Rice now has that vitamin A, and that is going to make a significant difference in dealing with malnutrition.We also know that in many areas of the world, where agricultural production has overtaxed the land, where drought has cut the production, where virus has plagued production, the way we can make farmers self-sufficient, where we can restore the farm economy in many of these countries, is through plant biotechnology.But this is just the beginning. This legislation I am introducing today is a discussion draft which I hope is going to lay the foundation for tremendous advances in the future. This legislation stems from findings and recommendations produced by a distinguished group of scientists working on the Agricultural Research, Economics and Education Task Force, which I was honored to be able to include in the 2002 farm bill. The distinguished task force was led by Dr. William H. Danforth, of St. Louis, the brother of our former distinguished colleague, Senator Jack Danforth. Dr. Bill Danforth has a tremendous reputation in science and in education, with a commitment to human welfare and is known worldwide. He was joined by Dr. Nancy Betts, the University of Nebraska; Mr. Michael Bryan, president of BBI International; Dr. Richard Coombe, the Watershed Agricultural Council; Dr. Victor Lechtenbert, Purdue University; Dr. Luis Sequeira, the University of Wisconsin; Dr. Robert Wideman, the University of Arkansas; and Dr. H. Alan Wood, Mississippi State University.I extend my congratulations and my sincere gratitude to Dr. Danforth and his team for providing the basis and the roadmap to ensure we have the mechanisms in place to solve the problems and capitalize on the opportunities in agricultural research. The full report of the task force can be found at &lt;a href=""http://www.ars.usda.gov/research.htm""&gt;www.ars.usda.gov/research.htm&lt;/a&gt;.In summary, that study concludes that it is absolutely necessary we reinvigorate and forward focus our technology to meet the responsibilities of our time. New investment is critical for the world's consumers, the protection of our natural resources, the standard of living for Americans who labor in rural America, and for the well-being of the hungry people and the needy people throughout the world.I look forward to pursuing this vision in the 109th Congress. I invite my colleagues who are interested in science and research to review this report, to look at this measure, to join with me and my cosponsors in the next session of Congress to talk about moving forward on what I think will be a tremendous opportunity to improve agriculture and its benefits to all our populations.Now, I cannot speak for all agricultural groups, but I talked to agricultural leaders of the various commodities, the farm organizations in my State of Missouri. They are very excited about it because these are the people who have been on the leading edge, who have pushed for the new technology, who have pushed for the new research that has enabled them to go from feeding 19 people per farmer a half century ago to feeding 129 people per farmer.Madam President, this, I hope, will be the start of something really big. So, with that, I send the draft of the legislation to the desk.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.",2015-03-17 19:10:56.156114,2015-03-17 19:10:56.156114,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2004-11-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-11-19/html/CREC-2004-11-19-pt2-PgS11641.htm,134,2,150,S11641-S11648,B000611,mr. bond
2695,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me for the purpose of talking about Congressman Bill Clay on the occasion of his retirement from the Congress.Let me first say that I have known Bill Clay for over 25 years. We both served on the St. Louis Board of Aldermen many years ago. We both come, obviously, from the same city and really in a way grew up together in the City of St. Louis and have had many of the same experiences in our time in politics.I clearly remember when I first got elected to Congress, Bill Clay invited me to lunch and we sat and talked about what it was like and what it meant to be in the Congress. He has been a mentor to me and has helped me in everything that I have done in public life.He is one of the finest human beings that I have ever met. He is a leader in every sense of the word on a whole range of issues that go from civil rights, which he has been deeply and intimately involved in through his entire career, through education, through health care, through labor and human rights and every other issue that is of importance to the people in his district.Perhaps most importantly he has always stayed deeply connected to the people who elected him. Never was there a time when he did not go home regularly, meet with his constituents, solve problems in the community, help people with community issues, and try to be an advocate for all of the people that he represented.He was also one who believed in politics. He is a politician in the truest sense of the word. And I admire that, I think, most in him, because he realized that to make change in our world, we have to be involved in political life.For most of his career in the Congress and in the Board of Aldermen, he was also a committeeman in the City of St. Louis political operation. He believes in political action. He also believed in civil disobedience when political action could not get the job done. I remember one of the first times I learned about him, he was engaged in, I think, a sit-in at a prominent bank in St. Louis in order to get proper civil rights with regard to that institution and other institutions like it in St. Louis.But never did his civil disobedience keep him from being involved in the political process. If he could get it done in the political process, he got it done in the political process. And to this day, he obviously has been involved in politics in the truest sense of the word.He has raised a wonderful family and his children, to his everlasting credit, are also involved in politics. And, in fact, we know his son is now running for the seat that Bill is leaving and retiring from, and I believe and hope that he will be elected. But, again, he is in public service like his father was in public service, his daughter has been involved in politics. The whole family is focused on political life and how we can improve our country, how we can improve our community.Bill Clay never stops fighting for what he believes in. He is the dean of our delegation. We will miss him in every sense. He is tenacious. He never gives up a cause. He has a wonderful sense of humor. He always makes fun of himself and makes fun of the funny things in politics that we all laugh about.In 32 years of service, no one fought harder for labor rights, for human rights, for education, and as I said, for his constituents. He was first elected in 1968. In his groundbreaking book, Just Permanent Interests: Black Americans in Congress 1870 to 1991, he wrote that the congressional election that year ``. . . reflected the changing fortune of blacks in American politics.'' With his classmates, Shirley Chisholm and Louis Stokes, he came ``. . . to Washington determined to seize the moment, to fight for justice, to raise issues that had been too long ignored and too little debated.'' And he did all of it.Mr. Speaker, he was and remains a passionate and forceful voice for the people in his district, for equal treatment of all Americans, regardless of race, regardless of ethnicity.In representing the hopes and aspirations of the people of his district, he built an institution within this institution that has stood for equal representation and opportunity. He was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which we are all so proud of today. He created one of the leading voices for African Americans in the Nation and an influential force in the House of Representatives.I might add that if the majority changes in this institution in a few days, for the first time in the history of this institution, the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means will be an African American, the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will be an African American. And I dare say if he had decided to stay, the chair of the Committee on Education and the Workforce would have been an African American. But none of that could have happened if Bill Clay had not helped form the Congressional Black Caucus and helped people of minority status run for the Congress and become Members of the Congress. And we would not have as many African Americans and Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans in the Congress if he had not fought those fights many, many years ago.He has also been on the side of working men and women. He was a leader on the minimum wage, protecting worker rights, getting safety in the workplace. He authored most of the legislation for working people over the last 32 years. He was a labor supporter who gave no ground to those who attacked the right to organize, who attacked worker protections and the right to earn a decent living. Working families in this country, labor union members have never had a better friend and they will never have a better friend in this Congress than Bill Clay.He was deeply committed to making sure that every child in this society should be able to realize their full potential. He was the leading supporter of historically black colleges, the beacons of advancement and achievement for African American young people. He helped craft the Family and Medical Leave law that has helped so many families today. He challenged every Member of this institution to live up to the ideas of equality and justice and enshrine those ideas into our laws.We are going to miss Bill Clay. I asked him before I came down here whether he had decided what he was going to do next year and he said, ``Well, I have not even thought about it.'' I am sure he has not. But I am convinced that his service for the people of this country does not end with his leaving the Congress. He will continue to fight in other capacities for the people of this country.This is a great leader. This is a heroic leader that we will miss in this institution. But I am only assured that knowing him, he will not stop the fight. He will be out on the field every day that he is on this earth fighting for children, fighting for civil rights, fighting for human rights, fighting for this democracy.Finally, let me say that America is a better, more just, more civilly equal society today because of the work and the commitment and the passion and the leadership of Bill Clay. We cannot say more about any of us who have ever served in this institution.Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman, ``Thank you, Bill. God bless, you. God bless your family.'',2015-03-17 19:10:56.456325,2015-03-17 19:10:56.456325,House,TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE WILLIAM L.

2696,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.Mr. Speaker, let me say that, for those who are watching on television and are not familiar with the rules of the House, we had 1 hour for this special order and it is now extending into the next hour that the gentleman has reserved and he has a plane to catch. So I certainly appreciate him allowing me just to say how overwhelmed I am by the expressions of support and of appreciation of kindness and the friendship that have been expressed on this House floor today.Let me say that I come from a family of seven children. My mother and father always taught each of us that modesty should never prevail over truth. So, in that vein and with that understanding, I accept all of the accolades that have been bestowed on me this afternoon because they are true. That is part of the whit that they talk about, Mr. Speaker. Let me seriously, though, thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Chairman Clyburn) and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus for sponsoring this tribute in honor of my years of service in the Congress.I also want to thank my other colleagues for their expressions of commendation for my work in this great body.In my 32 years in Congress, I can only remember a few tributes such as this one. The last one that stands out for me was the one for my good friend, Lewis Stokes, at the end of the last Congress.Let me also offer a special word of thanks and appreciation to my friend and our minority leader, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt), and the other members of the Missouri delegation for their support throughout the years we have served together.I also want to thank the members on the Committee on Education and Workforce who have inserted statements into the Record on behalf of my contribution to this Congress.Finally, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my wife and children for their patience, for their understanding, and for their acceptance and participation at every level and every phase of my journey.Once again, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for handling this special order.Mr. Speaker, I am overwhelmed by the expressions of support and appreciation, kindness and friendship, so I accept accolades because they are true. I want to thank Chairman Clyburn and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus for sponsoring this tribute in honor of my years of service in the Congress. I also want to thank all other colleagues for their expressions of praise and commendation for my work in this great body. In my 32 years in Congress, I can only remember a few tributes such as this one. the last one that stands out was the one for my good friend, Louis Stokes at the end of the last Congress.Let me also offer a special word of thanks and appreciation to my friend and our Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and the other members of the Missouri delegation for their support throughout the years we have served together.Those of us in the profession of politics know that like other careers, we cannot be successful without support from many quarters. Recognizing that, I want to express my deepest appreciation to a great staff, to the thousands of friends and constituents for their continuous support, and to the voters of the 1st Congressional District of Missouri who 16 times went to the voting booth and elected me to this great office.Finally, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my wife and children for their patience, understanding--and for their acceptance and participation at every level and in every phase of my journey.During my tenure, there have been many highlights. Some stand out brighter than others. Perhaps one of the greatest was having the privilege of being one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. Thirty-two years ago, Shirley Chisholm, Lou Stokes, and I came to Washington the same day. It was historic. Three blacks elected at one time. We joined six others and became the largest number of African Americans to serve in Congress at one time. The three of us were determined to seize the moment, to fight for justice, to raise issues too long ignored and too little debated. We were described by the media as militant, aggressive new leaders determined to make changes in the way black members of Congress had been viewed in the past. And we wasted no time seeking to establish a forum for articulating our concerns. That medium was the founding of the Congressional Black Caucus. It has served its purpose well.I am also proud of the role I have played in helping to create new programs to address the problems of millions of Americans. During my life in this institution, I have been privileged to personally participate in the drafting and passage of many landmark pieces of legislation--coal mine safety, ERISA, Black Lung Benefits Act, the first appropriations for sickle cell disease research, the direct student loan program, the civil service program, OSHA, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.I am even more proud of legislation that bears my name as primary sponsor or that I managed successfully on the floor of this House: reduction of pension vesting from 10 years to 5 years, Hatch Act reform, 60 days plant closing notification, the minimum wage increase of 1996, COBRA legislation that will continue employee health plans after job separation, financial assistance to enhance and preserve historically black colleges, the several reauthorizations of the Higher Education Act, enhanced support for Hispanic serving institutions, IDEA, class size reduction and family and medical leave.Thanks to many of you in this Chamber, I have been able to fashion and to pass the kind of legislation that has improved the standard of living and the quality of life for millions of our citizens.Serving in the United States Congress is one of the greatest honors that is possible to bestow upon an American citizen. In the 224 year history of this country, less than 10,000 American have enjoyed the distinction of serving in the House of Representatives.To those who will have the honor and privilege of being elected to serve in the next Congress for the first time, I would like to offer one small but important bit of advice--always remember the awesome consequences, nationally and internationally, of your decisions. We live in the greatest, most prosperous country in the history of the world. The 260 million people we represent enjoy collectively the highest standard of living on the face of the Earth. But, many of our citizens have not been able to enjoy the benefits of that great standard of living--many have been left out, left behind. Too many of our citizens suffer disproportionately the slings and arrows of misfortune through no fault of their own--sickness, disease, poverty--poor and inadequate education rob them of their opportunity to fully participate in the American dream. Always remember when legislating that their destiny is inextricably tied to your destiny. Your struggle and their struggle are tied irrevocably one to the other.Once again, thanks for the opportunity to serve and to help make this the greatest nation on Earth. It has been a great challenge and a rewarding career.,2015-03-17 19:10:56.936662,2015-03-17 19:10:56.936662,House,SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENCY,2000-10-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-27/html/CREC-2000-10-27-pt1-PgH11430.htm,137,2,146,H11430-H11435,C000488,mr. clay
2697,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thought, as children are going back to school across the country and in our States, we ought to take a few moments to think about the education they are receiving and how we as parents, not just in our role as legislators, can make a real difference in how our children develop.The truth is, we have come to know the foundations of learning begin long before a child ever gets to school. Babies from birth to age 3 years old are learning fundamental language skills at this time. Research tells us that 50 percent of a child's mature learning intelligence develops by the time that child is 3 years old. We can play a very large role in determining how successful that learning function is. We do this by reading to children even before they are old enough to hold a book. We do this by talking to them. We do this by interacting with them.Over the August recess I traveled around the State of Missouri, focusing on the issue of literacy and working with young children who were in preschool classes or, in Missouri, in our Parents as Teachers Program. I found it to be a very exciting, a very interesting, and a rewarding experience, and one that I hope we can show--all of us, as colleagues, as others who are concerned--is a very rewarding activity for the parents.We have always thought that early childhood was a key learning time. That is common sense. But now we have seen it validated by science. The development of children's learning skills depends upon the child's exposure to language in the earliest years. What we do to encourage and stimulate literacy, reading ability, communicating ability, in very young children, is going to provide the basis of their success later in life.When you come to think about it, reading is the basic skill. Learning to understand, to read and communicate is absolutely essential, particularly as we live in a complex society. Most of us think about reading and learning as part of the economic process of getting a job. I can tell you that my experiences in job training in the years when I was Governor reemphasized the importance of that. In my second term as Governor we had an on-the-job training program for industries expanding in Missouri and creating new jobs. I will never forget visiting one facility where they were installing sophisticated computer-assisted manufacturing systems. They were very complicated. You had to understand a lot of science to do the job well. And these jobs were extremely high-paying jobs. As a matter of fact, one of the workers in one of those jobs, working a 2,000-hour year, would earn more than the Governor of Missouri would have at that time. The science had all developed since I last opened a science textbook in college.They had a 6-week training program for these workers. Four of the weeks were devoted to teaching these workers to read, because so many of them had not learned the basic reading and understanding skills in school. The prize there was demonstrable; the prize was visible. If you could read and understand, you could operate one of these machines and earn more than the Governor of Missouri was earning. And there is no question, as I talked to employers around the State, they are looking for and begging for workers. But the workers have to be able to read and understand complicated instructions, because the tasks that the workers will be called on to perform, now and in the years ahead, are rapidly changing. They are changing with technology. And the people who are doing the work have to learn to read and understand the changed instructions.So, reading is a fundamental skill, an absolutely essential skill to get ahead economically. But we ought not to focus ourselves just on the economic side. To be an informed citizen, to participate in our democratic form of government, requires that people read, be able to understand all the messages that are coming to them. Reading provides the basis for communicating and getting along in the world in many other ways--in social activities, in community activities. So, literacy really is the fundamental basis, the foundation for knowledge and for development of well-informed, well-attuned children in our communities, in our States and in our Nation. Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made literacy her top priority, and I take my hat off to her. I think, as I see more and more of the challenges we face in this country, the more I understand that Mrs. Bush is right. Where people do not have the fundamental reading skills, they have significant problems.One of the reasons I have been closely associated with this literacy project is following up on the Parents as Teachers program we have in Missouri. Parents as Teachers begins by providing assistance, on a voluntary basis, to parents of children from birth to 3 years old. We have found that parents who participate in this program with their children--No. 1, are able to avoid many of the serious learning problems that affect children today and require that they be put in remedial or special education; but we are also finding that in every measure of scientific testing, these children are scoring higher than their peers. When I talk to kindergarten teachers and elementary schoolteachers and administrators, they can see the difference in these children who have worked in the program where literacy is emphasized, where parents reading to their children is emphasized.I spent the month of August trying to encourage more and more families in Missouri--parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, caregivers--to read to their children to show that it is fun, but also to tell them that it is vitally important.Also, we want to expand--and this bill does provide expansion of the opportunities for more States to participate in the Parents as Teachers Program. At my request, the chairman of the committee and the ranking member included $30 million to expand Parents as Teachers programs to other States around the country and to improve on the program. Already, 47 States participate, to some degree, in the program.Early childhood learning and development is important, and we can do a much better job. The Parents as Teachers Program is one that has had tremendous success. Mr. President, 150,000 Missouri families voluntarily participate in that program every year, and if you want to know if the program works, I can refer you to any one of those 150,000 families, because they see it is working, they know it is working, and, Mr. President, this bill provides more resources to help start these programs in every school district in the country.I hope there will be a time when we find that families, wherever they are, who want help developing the child's learning skills will be able to get the kind of assistance that is now available in Missouri. It can make a difference, and it will make a difference in our children's education, their preparation for the work force but, most of all, their preparation to take the role in society as responsible adults, as responsible parents themselves.I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting and keeping in the money for early childhood development. I hope to work with Senator Kerry and others to provide authorizing legislation in this session to expand on the opportunities to support early childhood development. Government programs are fine, but it all comes down to the responsibility of the parents, and that responsibility is very easy to outline, because the starting point is reading to children, relating to them and showing them the excitement and the wonders that are opened through reading of books and other materials.I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:10:57.180836,2015-03-17 19:10:57.180836,Senate,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-04/html/CREC-1997-09-04-pt1-PgS8772-2.htm,115,38,143,S8772-S8782,B000611,mr. bond
2698,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, the debate we will be having in the Senate is on whether to suspend the rules of the Senate to consider a resolution censuring the President's conduct.A motion will be made to indefinitely postpone the motion to suspend the rules. These votes will occur before Senators have the opportunity to amend the resolution censuring the President's conduct.I take the floor of the Senate to make clear that I am opposed to a censure resolution of President Clinton.The Impeachment Trial of President William Jefferson Clinton is over. The Senate has faithfully discharged its constitutional obligation by serving as impartial jurors of the Articles of Impeachment approved by a bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives.The Senate has rendered its verdict, and has found the President not guilty as charged. The consequence of this action by the Senate is to keep the President in office where he is to fully and faithfully discharge the constitutional duties of his office.The trial is over. It is time for the Senate to focus on the national legislative agenda.On this last point, I chose my words carefully. I did not say it is time for the Senate to turn to the people's business.Some have said we should not have had the trial or should have adjourned the trial much earlier so that we could turn to the people's business.I reject that notion. I firmly believe that conducting the trial was doing the people's business.But the truth is the trial is over. I do not see any place for the pending resolution censuring the President. It is not the business of the Senate to punish President Clinton.As Senator Byrd has concluded censure, unlike impeachment, is ``extra-constitutional.'' The Constitution empowers the Senate to try a President impeached by the House and remove him if 67 Senators agree.The Constitution does not empower the Senate to punish a President, in the absence of 67 votes to remove. The impeachment trial is over.The Senate should move on and leave President Clinton alone.The Constitution recognizes that if a President cannot be removed through impeachment, he should not be weakened by censure. Although the Senate passes sense of the Senate resolutions on many subjects, censure is different because the Constitution requires a \2/3\ vote before the Senate can discipline the President and requires removal upon conviction for impeachable offenses. Censure is an effort to end-run these constitutional requirements.One final problem is that any censure resolution will have to be weak. Even proponents of censure concede that a censure resolution that actually punished the President would be an unconstitutional bill of attainder. Any censure that is consistent with the Bill of Attainder Clause is too weak to be worth doing.The highest form of censure the Constitution allows is impeachment by the House. The failure to convict the President will not erase that action by the House. It is time for the Senate to move on.If the effort to suspend the rules passes, and the text of the censure resolution is before the Senate, and is amendable, I will seek recognition to offer the following substitute, and I quote:After the word ``Resolved'' strike everything and insert the following:``That the United States Senate at the earliest opportunity will consider and have final votes on legislation favorably reported by its committees that-- (1) reduces taxes so that Americans no longer pay record high levels of federal income taxes; (2) prohibits the financial surplus in the Social Security Trust Funds from financing additional deficit spending in the operating budget of the United States Government; (3) increases funds and flexibility for programs that local school districts and their parents, teachers and principals believe will enhance teaching and learning; (4) offers comprehensive responses to juvenile justice needs and criminal drug abuse, including increased penalties for adults who use minors in the commission of crimes, increased penalties for drug trafficking, and greater resources for local law enforcement agencies to stop methamphetamine trafficking. (5) improves military pay to reduce sharp declines in attracting new and keeping well-qualified solders in the all- volunteer Armed Forces.''This substitute resolution speaks for itself. This resolution sets the Senate on the right course for the Senate to accomplish the legislative priorities of this nation.These priorities include:Congress this year should direct the budget surplus to where it belongs, and that is to the people whose hard work produced the surplus.That means Congress should cut taxes. Americans should no longer pay record high levels of federal income taxes.The average household paid 25 percent of its income in taxes (federal, state, and local) and 30 percent of every additional dollar earned by a four-person median income household of $55,000 will go to pay taxes.The typical American family spends more money on taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined. Each year Americans work four months and 10 days just to pay their taxes. The tax burden is getting worse, not better. For the past five years, tax payments have grown faster than salaries. Total federal taxes in 1997 were the highest since World War II.Second, Congress should protect Social Security.The best action we can take now to protect the economic security of tomorrow's retirees is to protect current surpluses from government raiding.Using these surpluses to pay down our debt will put our country in the best possible financial position to meet our future obligations.Third, we should improve education by increasing funds and flexibility for programs that local school districts and their parents, teachers and principals believe will enhance teaching and learning.The Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar.Local school districts could find far better uses of the $10-$12 billion Washington spends. With direct funding, local schools could deploy resources to areas they deem most crucial for their students, such as hiring new teachers, raising teacher salaries, buying new textbooks or new computersFourth, Congress must fight crime and drug abuse.While in the last few years the violent crime rate has declined, it remains at levels that are far too high. In 1960, 159 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants were reported; in 1997, 611 were reported. In short, violent crime has quadrupled since 1960.Drug abuse, especially use of methamphetamines, is also at dangerous levels. Public health and law enforcement officials believe that meth is more dangerous and addictive than cocaine and heroin. Communities are being devastated and the problem is growing exponentially. In 1994, DEA agents in Missouri seized 14 clandestine meth labs. Last year, they seized 421 labs.Meth use is dangerous, threatens our children and causes users to commit other crimes. Among 12th graders, the use of ice, a smokeable form of meth, has risen 60 percent since 1992. Meth-related emergency room incidents are up 63 percent over this same period.Fifth, Congress should improve military pay to reduce sharp declines in attracting new and keeping well-qualified solders in the all-volunteer Armed Forces.1999 marks the 14th straight year of decline in real dollars spent on our national defense. The number of active duty personnel is down 30% since 1991. Despite these reductions, the military is being asked to do more than it did during the Cold War.In writing these principles, I strived for bipartisan agreement. I believe many, if not all of these, principles have been articulated as priorities on both sides of the aisle.I did not include my own proposals for accomplishing these objectives. The details of these principles can and should be worked out by the committees of the Senate, and then by the full Senate.Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair. ,2015-03-17 19:10:57.658180,2015-03-17 19:10:57.658180,Senate,CENSURE RESOLUTION,1999-02-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-02-12/html/CREC-1999-02-12-pt1-PgS1461.htm,26,0,145,S1461-S1462,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2699,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the members of the Dickson family who are committed to their education and love for the art of music. That is why parents Raymond and Theresa Dickson chose to simultaneously enroll four of their children at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Music Majors Ashley, Benjamin, Brandon and Daniel Dickson receive lessons and recite together as a string quartet, under the tutelage of the ``Arianna String Quartet'', the University's quartet-in-residence. It is believed to be the only resident quartet in a public university in the United States. The Dickson family chose Florissant, Missouri to maintain a strong support structure for their University students.Prior to moving to Florissant, Raymond, Theresa and their ten children had been living in Battle Ground Washington a suburb of Portland, Oregon for several years. The children were home-schooled. Most of them elected to learn an instrument. Over time, four of the eldest Dickson's began performing together as the Dickson String Quartet.While honing their skills at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville, Oregon, they caught the collective ears of the Arianna String Quartet, who were guest instructors at the two-week string quartet academy. ``When people hear them, I don't think they can help but be drawn in,'' Arianna violist Joanna Mendoza told University of Missouri-St. Louis Magazine.The feeling was mutual for the Dickson's, who desired a continuation of their studies with the Arianna. Working with the university, members of the Arianna were able to create an opportunity for the four Dicksons to enroll together and learn as an ensemble with University of Missouri-St. Louis' resident quartet.With the Dickson String Quartet ranging in age from 16 to 20 and never having attended a public school at the time of their enrollment at University of Missouri-St. Louis, Raymond and Theresa decided to move their family to maintain a support structure for the new university students.The Dickson students have thrived at University of Missouri-St. Louis. They've quickly established a reputation as leaders and role models in the Department of Music and Pierre Laclede Honors College. They participate in several performance ensembles, play together as ``the quartet for worship'' at their local church and have several standing ovations through their performances as a sibling quartet.Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to the Dickson family and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring them.,2015-03-17 19:10:58.090482,2015-03-17 19:10:58.090482,Extensions,HONORING THE DICKSON STRING QUARTET AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-ST.

2700,MO,Billy,Long,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of one of Missouri's finest leaders and my personal friend, John Twitty.John is an icon in the 7th District. He's provided Springfield, Missouri with affordable electricity, inexpensive natural gas, and clean drinking water for almost a decade as the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of City Utilities. You would be hard-pressed to find a better leader with more integrity, which is evidenced by the high regard in which he is held throughout the city of Springfield, the State of Missouri, and across the country.Whether he is dealing with employees, the general public, or community leaders, John maintains his professionalism and character. He sincerely cares for each one of the employees at City Utilities and for the entire Springfield community.I am just one of many in the community that recognizes John as an outstanding leader. For his national leadership, he received the American Public Power Association's Alex Radin Distinguished Service Award--its top honor. He has also served as their Chairman. For his statewide leadership, he received the Missouri Association of Municipal Utilities Distinguished Service Award. For his contribution to Missouri and the nation, he received the Missourian Award and the Outstanding Missourian Award from the Missouri House of Representatives and the Missouri Senate.John has also been very active in the Springfield community. Although he would be the last to say so himself, John has given much to Springfield through his outreach and involvement in community organizations. He has worked with the United Way of the Ozarks, the Springfield Business and Development Corporation, the Partnership Industrial Center West Administrative Council, St. John's Health System, Empire Bank, the Rotary Club of Springfield Southeast, the Boys & Girls Town of Missouri, and other local organizations.John will retire this June. No doubt, he will enjoy spending more time playing golf and with his family. John's family includes his wife, Jean, a retired Greene Country Assessor and current member of the Springfield Public Schools Board of Education, and his daughter, Dr. Anne S. Twitty, an Assistant Professor of History at the University of Mississippi.Although John is about to embark on a much-deserved leave of absence, his legacy will live on whenever a family cooks dinner using low-cost electricity or when children drink clean water from a school water fountain. He has faithfully performed the duty shared by all public servants; he left the institutions in his care stronger and better for the next generation. Let us all draw humility and purpose from his example.,2015-03-17 19:10:58.259608,2015-03-17 19:10:58.259608,Extensions,COMMENDING JOHN TWITTY OF SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI,2011-04-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-05/html/CREC-2011-04-05-pt1-PgE638-2.htm,48,0,157,E638,L000576,mr. long
2701,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a true St. Louis legend and visionary, Mr. Earl Wilson, Jr. on the occasion of his retirement from the St. Louis Gateway Classic Sports Foundation. Earl Wilson has devoted his life to serving the St. Louis community first as a trailblazing corporate executive and later as a dedicated community servant. His commitment led him to establish one of the most honored and respected community organizations in the Midwest, The St. Louis Gateway Classic Sports Foundation.Mr. Wilson has been blazing a path for inner-city residents, especially the youth of St. Louis, since graduating high school and becoming an ROTC captain at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri. He served as a captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was a successful 30 year executive with IBM. He also had the honor of serving as the Marketing Director for the U.S. Olympic Festival in St. Louis in 1994. He has been a wonderful husband and dedicated father of four.Sixteen years ago, Mr. Wilson created the St. Louis Gateway Classic Foundation in an effort to elevate the status of African Americans in St. Louis. The Gateway Classic was originally organized as a football event hosting teams from historic black colleges and universities. The game eventually grew into his trademark St. Louis Gateway Classic Sports Foundation and has created an impressive list of community events and initiatives.Through the foundation Mr. Wilson has raised millions of dollars for his scholarship fund leading to the education of more than 100 African-American students who otherwise might not have the means to attend college. Over sixty of the awardees graduated from historically black colleges or universities.He also established the St. Louis Gateway Classic Walk of Fame. The Walk of Fame highlights the sacrifices and achievements of area African Americans. It has honored the lives of prominent St. Louis citizens such as Dick Gregory, Jackie-Joyner Kersee, former Congressman William L. Clay, Sr., Ozzie Smith and the Fifth Dimension.Mr. Wilson has exhibited a tireless dedication to his community throughout his life. That commitment has been an inspiration to his family, friends and all that have come to know him. His impact on young people's lives in the St. Louis community can be measured in his wonderful array of good works.Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Mr. Wilson; a man who has made a difference in each life that he has touched.

2702,MO,Todd,Akin,R,So we've got some solutions. I was just thinking about the voters in all the different States that are frustrated. They may be listening to us even here on the floor of the Congress, and they're thinking, Do they guys get it or not? Why are they talking about these huge Big Government solutions and spending the money that we don't have. I'm not sure some of them aren't ready to declare independence again.I was just thinking, if you're going to write a declaration of independence relative to health care, one of the things you say is, it's not going to add a whole lot of money to the big national debt. That's one thing you've got to pay attention to. It's not going to impose mandates on States or employers or individuals. And it's not going to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortions or illegal immigrants.I think those are all things that have been debated and discussed and people are upset about. It's going to be negotiated, I think, in a free and open format instead of behind closed doors. We're going to reserve that doctor-patient relationship. And we're going to allow freedom, which has worked so well in America for a couple of hundred years, to reign. To actually have some freedom to let people make choices and trust them to make their own choices and then do some of these commonsense solutions that you're talking about to not try to reproduce the failed systems of the Soviet Union or the failed systems of European medicine or Canadian medicine, which are very inefficient and expensive, but rather build on the model of freedom and people's free choices and people making distinctions between what sort of health care they do or don't want and, particularly, allowing doctors to practice medicine without feeling threatened from lawyers or insurance companies or Big Brother looking over their shoulder.If you go to med school and spend a quarter of a million bucks on education, I think I'd rather have your opinion as to what you ought to do to me. I don't mean to rant here, but it seems like we need some sort of statement or declaration or something about some basic principles that Americans believe in.I yield to you, Doctor Roe.,2015-03-17 19:10:58.656889,2015-03-17 19:10:58.656889,House,HEALTH CARE,2010-01-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-01-20/html/CREC-2010-01-20-pt1-PgH248-3.htm,6,49,156,H248-H255,A000358,mr. akin
2703,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Speaker, I am continually inspired by the great philanthropy and giving nature of the American people. When humanity suffers, where calamity arises--floods in Indonesia, earthquakes in Haiti or Chile, war-torn landscapes around the world or in poverty stricken populations in the Sudan--Americans respond with their time, energy and sacrifice. This outpouring of generosity to foreign lands and different cultures is a uniquely American trait. The Peace Corps, created 49 years ago this week, embodies that trait.It was President John F. Kennedy who urged Americans to serve their country by working in developing countries and their local villages to enhance the quality of life for others. Approximately 7,600 Peace Corps Volunteers, including five from Southwest Missouri, are serving in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific Islands.I am proud of the service of the five Southwest Missourians currently volunteering in the Peace Corps. Megan Abbott began her service in Belize four months ago. Austin Durr has been in Paraguay since 2007. Laura Pegram has served in Botswana since June 2008. Bruce Taylor has served for one year in Kenya and will serve another year. Scott Tuttle has been in Niger since 2008. Leaving behind the comforts and conveniences of home, Peace Corps volunteers like Abbot, Durr, Pegram, Taylor and Tuttle are symbols of our nation's commitment to progress, opportunity and development in the developing world.Their desire to make a difference, like that of 200,000 Americans who have served since 1961, has improved the lives of millions of people around the world.Peace Corps volunteers learn languages and receive extensive cross-cultural training, enabling them to function effectively at a professional level. Volunteers have made lasting contributions around the world in agriculture, business development, information technology, health, education, HIV/AIDS, youth and the environment.Recognizing the legions of Peace Corps volunteers, past and present, who work hard everyday to improve the lives of the people they assist affirms our nation's commitment to helping people help themselves in the pursuit of life, liberty and prosperity throughout the world.To Megan Abbott, Austin Durr, Laura Pegram, Bruce Taylor and Scott Tuttle, I want to express my sincere thanks for your service in the Peace Corps.,2015-03-17 19:10:58.789979,2015-03-17 19:10:58.789979,Extensions,NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK, THE 49TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CREATION OF THE PEACE CORPS,2010-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-03-04/html/CREC-2010-03-04-pt1-PgE312-4.htm,30,0,156,E312-E313,B000575,mr. blunt
2704,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, today we are taking up H.R. 4178, the Deposit Restricted Qualified Tuition Programs Act of 2009. This bill establishes an avenue for those wanting to save for the college education of a child, grandchild, or other related individual, to do so in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC-insured, deposit.At the present time, savers can only access the 529 College Savings Program through a securities-based plan, and my bill would not change this avenue. However, following the recent crash of the stock market, many savers saw their accounts drop in value by 50 percent or more, and as such, are reluctant to place any more money in a securities-based plan. Furthermore, many small savers can find investing in securities-based products both complex and intimidating. An FDIC-insured deposit option would provide guaranteed principal return and a guaranteed return on the deposit, all from a commercial bank with which the saver likely has a relationship.This proposed legislation will help families across the United States save in a safe, sound, and simple manner for their children and grandchildren's college education. This bill does not make any changes to the current 529 College Savings Program nor the current delivery system of the program through a securities-based plan, nor the tax treatment of the 529 plans. It simply adds another 529 College Savings Program delivery option through an FDIC-insured deposit.This is a bipartisan bill. It has both the chairman and the ranking Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee as cosponsors, among other Republicans and Democrats. At a time when our Nation is concerned about congressional quarreling based on political party affiliation, it is refreshing that both parties can support this bill.Currently, section 529 programs are established and maintained by the States, who in turn generally contract out with securities firms and others to administer the programs. Investors may go through a State agency to invest in a 529 or, in many cases, through a securities dealer. Many States typically offer a number of investment options or portfolios, including ones that minimize the potential loss of invested principal. The bill is intended to encourage States to offer, among the options they provide investors, deposit-restricted qualified tuition programs.The bill will not be independent of, nor compete with, the current State programs. In order to qualify as a 529 program under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, the program must be established and maintained by a State. Therefore, this program would be a State program, and the laws of the various States would have to be adapted to establish such a program.In my home State of Missouri, the law which has already been adopted establishes a deposit-only program as separate from the securities-based program. The State would still generally hire a third party to administer the program. The third party could be the same one that manages the securities program or it could be a different third party. I do have a letter of support from our State Treasurer asking that this bill be approved.H.R. 4178 does not create a State program. The bill is intended to provide States another option to offer investors this deposit-restricted qualified tuition program.Total 529 savings plans assets were $117 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting a 6 percent increase from third quarter 2009 assets of $110.5 billion.My office asked the FDIC for statistical information on 529 plans and deposit insurance programs. The FDIC provided the following information: ``Currently seven States offer 529 plans that include an option to invest in an insured deposit either as part of a broader investment strategy or as a sole investment. All of these plans are open to nonresidents, although the Ohio plan requires nonresidents to go through a broker to access the plan. Two of the States have offered the insured deposit option since 1998. Three of the States recently added the insured deposit option to their plans. States offering an insured deposit investment option are Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Information gathered from five of these States indicates that at the end of 2009, there was approximately $670 million invested in FDIC-insured deposit options of their plans. For these States approximately $207 million was added to the FDIC-insured option in 2009. Three of the responding States were able to identify whether the funds invested in their FDIC-insured option represented new money or a transfer of funds from another option in an already established 529 plan. For these States approximately 47 percent of the funds placed in the FDIC-insured option in 2009 were transferred from other 529 options, representing approximately $82 million of the approximately $173 million added to the FDIC-insured option in these States.''Additionally, the FDIC has already said they will insure 529 deposited accounts at the regular insured rate of $250,000, which we raised. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have completed the review of the budgetary impact of H.R. 4178, the Deposit Restricted Qualified Tuition Programs Act of 2009. They determined that by enacting this legislation, it would affect revenues but estimate that the reduction in revenues would not be significant over the 2010-2020 period. Similarly, implementing the bill could affect direct spending, but the net impact of such spending would be negligible over the next 10 years.Mr. Speaker, in particular I would like to congratulate the Missouri Bankers Association president, Max Cook, for bringing this needed bill to my attention. The Missouri Bankers Association moved a bill in the Missouri legislature several years ago to allow the FDIC-insured 529 deposit accounts because they thought it would be helpful to Missouri college students and parents who were saving for them.For the Record, I would like to submit records of support from the Missouri Bankers Association, the Missouri Independent Bankers Association, the Office of the Missouri State Treasurer, the Independent Community Bankers Association, and the American Bankers Association. Although the support letters are written in support of H.R. 3599, H.R. 4178 is identical to H.R. 3599 except for some small technical changes and more cosponsors.I am pleased this Congress will address H.R. 4178 and move the legislation forward. This is a bill all Members can support. I strongly urge all Members to vote for H.R. 4178.Dear Representative Cleaver: I am writing today on behalf of the three hundred twenty-five Missouri Bankers Association member banks and savings and loans to express our exuberant support for H.R. 3599, The Deposit Restricted Qualified Tuition Programs Act of 2009. As you know, this legislation establishes a means for thousands and thousands of Americans wanting to save for the college education of a child, grandchild or other related person and to do so in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured deposit. At the present time, savers can only access the 529 college savings program through a securities based plan. This legislation leaves that in place and adds the FDIC insured deposit option. After the recent crash of the stock market, many savers saw their 529 accounts drop in value by as much as fifty percent or more and as such are reluctant to place any more monies in a securities based plan. Furthermore, many small savers can find investing in securities based products both complex and intimidating. A FDIC insured deposit option would provide guaranteed principal return and a guaranteed return on the deposit, all from a commercial bank that the saver likely has a relationship with. This proposed legislation will help families across the United States save in a safe, sound and simple manner for their children and grandchildren's college education. We sincerely thank you for your sponsorship of this legislation and look forward to its swift passage in the House.

2705,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from California for her leadership and work on this important legislation, supporting the MS Awareness Week.Every week, around 200 people are diagnosed in this country with MS; and, indeed, there's been a spike in diagnoses among our military. That is one of the reasons the past several years we have been able to fight for and obtain funding through the Department of Defense congressionally directed research program.We also have worked with addressing the issue in terms of creating the national registry, so we can help track this difficult disease that has eluded a cure for so long.I am proud to serve as cochair of the Congressional MS Caucus along with my colleague here today, Michael Burgess. He has been a good partner in promoting this. The MS Caucus is a bipartisan group of a 127 Members of this House actively engaged in discussions about access to quality health care, raising awareness, promoting education, and increasing MS research. I want to urge my colleagues here today to not just support this resolution, but if you're not already a member of the MS Caucus, I urge you to join us. I urge you to connect with your local chapters to help support the people that are living and suffering with MS, but also to help find that cure, to move research forward.This year marks the fifth annual MS Awareness Week. The week was created by the MS Coalition and the National MS Society to raise national awareness about MS. I especially want to thank St. Louis' Gateway Chapter of the National MS Society for their unwavering dedication, for their help for people back in my home city, and for their support of my work here in the Congress. I'm grateful for their hard work to provide support and assistance for those living with and affected by MS.This spring, in fact, more than 8,000 Missourians took part in the Walk MS event across the State, raising awareness and funds to help those living with MS every day, for the challenges they face from this disease.Today, I want to again urge my colleagues to support this resolution to help create a world free of MS.,2015-03-17 19:10:59.095196,2015-03-17 19:10:59.095196,House,MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AWARENESS WEEK,2010-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-04-21/html/CREC-2010-04-21-pt1-PgH2737.htm,57,12,156,H2737-H2740,C001060,mr. carnahan
2706,MO,Todd,Akin,R,That's a great point. And let's repeat that. What you just said was, you don't raise taxes during a recession.And what we are going to talk about here tonight--there are some bad assumptions that were made that are destroying our country and that are destroying our budget, our economy, and just killing jobs in America and creating a whole lot of hardship.But it doesn't have to be that way. There is potentially good news. But we just have to follow the principles, just like airplanes follow aerodynamics, we have to follow the principles of economics. And one of those--you just got to the bottom line--is, you've got to ease off on the taxes. And there is a logical reason for it.Let's just take a look, though, so people understand the gravity of what we are looking at. This is who owns our debt. This debt is created because we are promising all kinds of benefits to American citizens, all kinds of promises that we are going to give them health care and we are going to give them housing and food and education and all the stuff that the Soviet Union also promised their citizens. And who is picking up the tab? A lot of foreigners are buying our debt.Here it is. Foreign holding of American debt was 5 percent in 1970. That was when I graduated from college. Foreign holdings, 1990, 20 years later, go from 5 to 19 percent in 20 years. Now, 20 years later, in 1210, foreign holdings, 47 percent.Is that healthy? How much longer are the Chinese and the other foreign countries going to continue to pay us money that we don't have to pay off American voters just to keep them happy? This is a glide path that will end up in a crash.The gentlewoman, Congresswoman Lummis, has suggested that, even now, trying to pull this thing out is going to take a number of years. This isn't something that can be turned around overnight.And I think this 20-year kind of pattern reflects the fact that what we are talking about is really serious here, but it still is basic economic principles.,2015-03-17 19:10:59.239303,2015-03-17 19:10:59.239303,House,THE ISRAEL BLOCKADE AND THE FLOTILLA,2010-06-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-09/html/CREC-2010-06-09-pt1-PgH4314-3.htm,86,33,156,H4314-H4321,A000358,mr. akin
2707,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 20-year anniversary of the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem, Palestine, which has long stood as an oasis of hope and peace in the Holy Land. This celebration also marks another significant milestone for the Holy Family Hospital, the 50,000th baby delivered.In 1990 the Order of Malta, responding to the critical need of maternal care in the region, opened Holy Family Hospital. Since its opening, the hospital has become the premier maternity hospital and newborn critical care center of the entire region which includes Bethlehem, neighboring towns and villages, four United Nations refugee camps, and Bedouin encampments in the Judean Desert.The need for Holy Family Hospital has continued to grow over the years, with an increase from 1,000 births annually to now over 3,000 and its outpatient clinics increased from 3,600 consultations a year, to over 22,000. The hospital built and maintains the only neonatal intensive care unit in the region. Thanks to their presence, the lives of 400 premature and low-birth-weight infants are saved every year. In addition, 90 midwives have been trained, which accounts for all the midwives working in all of the hospitals in the entire West Bank.Holy Family Hospital continues to offer the latest in medicine to the Bethlehem area, including mammography, laparoscopic surgery, and Echo Doppler diagnosis not found anywhere else in the region. Additionally, a program of continuing medical education has been instituted which has brought renowned medical professionals to the hospital as visiting professors.As well as providing critical health care, the hospital provides many a livelihood. Mr. President, 150 hospital employees are provided steady work and a fair wage, many of whom are the sole support of large extended families.The top-notch care and much-needed jobs in an underserved area make the hospital special, but what makes Holy Family truly shine is their commitment to bringing peace to the families in the region. From facilitating Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in the medical field to their care of pregnant mothers and babies regardless of race or religion, Holy Family Hospital is a beacon of hope in the West Bank.This 20th anniversary celebration and 50,000th baby delivered would not be possible without the Holy Family staff and volunteers from around the world and for their dedication to the most vulnerable Palestinians.Over the next 20 years, it is critical that the U.S. continue to partner with Holy Family so the hospital can carry forward their critical vision for hope and peace.Congratulations and thank you for not only saving the lives of thousands of babies, but touching the lives of countless more. ,2015-03-17 19:10:59.383405,2015-03-17 19:10:59.383405,Senate,20TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOLY FAMILY HOSPITAL,2010-09-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-29/html/CREC-2010-09-29-pt1-PgS7746-3.htm,133,0,156,S7746-S7747,B000611,mr. bond
2708,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Reclaiming my time.One of the things that strikes me and is of great concern to me is something that I believe was in the dustbin of history in our thinking for many years now, and that was the old Soviet Socialist Republic, the USSR. If you think back before the Berlin Wall fell--some of us are old enough to remember--that was a formidable--and we were concerned about the USSR, but we didn't ever believe that its economics were any good because we knew they were a bunch of socialists over there. That's what the ``USSR'' part was all about. So, in a way, when we saw the Berlin Wall come down, we could kind of catch our breath, but we kind of laughed at them as saying, ``See, we knew that old socialism wasn't going to work.''And what was that country based on? The basic assumption was that the government is going to provide you what? Well, I guess one of the first things would be the government's going to provide you with education. And then another thing the government's going to provide is health care, which I know, as a couple of medical doctors, this is something that we know a little bit about when the government decides to get in the health care business. And then, of course, we're going to have the government provide you with food and housing, you see. And then the government's going to give you a job.And that was the heart--aside from being just sort of antireligious, the USSR, that was the heart of their program. The government is going to do all of this stuff.And now, just a few weeks ago, the cover of a major news magazine in America, it says, ``We're All Socialists Now.'' When I saw that, I felt a little frustrated, because I'm not a socialist. And the people I represent are not socialists. And they didn't like socialism, and they don't want the government running everything in their lives.,2015-03-17 19:10:59.539518,2015-03-17 19:10:59.539518,House,REASONS FOR THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN,2009-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-02-25/html/CREC-2009-02-25-pt1-PgH2812-4.htm,33,37,155,H2812-H2819,A000358,mr. akin
2709,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Reclaiming my time, you know, what we're talking about here is, are we going to let the marketplace work? Are we going to trust in productivity? Are we going to trust in Americans that have always been able to deal with these situations?We have been through a lot of crises as Americans, and yet there's something very, very special about our country. So many unique things. Aside from just the beautiful land that we enjoy, as soon as there's a tsunami or some huge storm or something, you see the Americans there trying to help all around the world. And you see the Americans in a positive way helping.But then there's some things that we're proud of that they didn't do. We won a couple of world wars at various times, and after we won those wars, after every other Nation in the world wins a war, they claim more territories and more jurisdiction. Instead, we didn't claim anybody's territory. We simply taxed ourselves to help rebuild our enemies. That's what makes us a different kind of country. And we're a country that has always put a premium on freedom. Every time we get a chance to give a talk, Judge, we ask people what's so special about America, the word that just bubbles out of their hearts is it's about freedom; it's about a chance to have a dream and to go out, and you may succeed, you may fail, but we're the land where dreams can become reality.We are the only Nation in the world that is based on a creed, that is based on a philosophical statement:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Earlier versions have life, liberty and property. That means it's not the job of the government to take everybody's property away from them and to slop it around and redistribute it. That is socialism. This idea was tried by the Soviet Union. The government is going to provide you with a job and with health care and with food, and the government is going to give you your education. That idea died in the dustbin of history when the Soviet Union collapsed.Our system is based on the idea of freedom and of allowing people to go out and invest their lives in businesses, not in the government's taxing their great grandchildren into the dirt.I will yield to my good friend.,2015-03-17 19:10:59.689647,2015-03-17 19:10:59.689647,House,CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY,2009-02-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-02-11/html/CREC-2009-02-11-pt1-PgH1214-2.htm,28,67,155,H1214-H1222,A000358,mr. akin
2710,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, let me take this time to honor a fellow Missourian, Lieutenant General Clyde A. Vaughn, who will be retiring as Director of the Army National Guard, after having served the nation for 35 years in the Army National Guard.While General Vaughn has performed a number of important roles during his time in the Army National Guard, he has served as Director of the Army National Guard since 2005. During his tenure as Director, he has overseen a period of increased operating tempo and helped to transform the Army National Guard.As Director, General Vaughn has implemented policies to increase the end strength of the Army National Guard and to ensure new members of the Guard are well trained and well equipped. He has overseen important Army National Guard missions at home and abroad, including missions along the U.S. Gulf Coast during and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, within California during wildfires, and along the U.S. border.Overseas, General Vaughn has helped to coordinate an important program in Afghanistan with the help of Missouri National Guardsmen and those from other states who are also experts in agriculture. In that troubled country, the Guard has partnered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Farm Bureau to develop and deploy Agribusiness Development Teams. These teams have helped to improve Afghanistan's agricultural livelihood. They have provided outreach, education, and infrastructure support to officials from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock and to local farmers. The advice given by these Guardsmen who are also agricultural experts betters the changes for economic stability and alternative livelihoods for Afghanistan's rural citizens.For the families of Army National Guard personnel, General Vaughn has overseen the development of the 325 Army National Guard Family Assistance Centers. These centers provide long-term informational, referral, and outreach support for geographically dispersed military families.General Vaughn's leadership has strengthened both the National Guard and the United States. I am proud that he is a Missourian who has given so much of his time to our country. I trust that Members of the House will join me in congratulating General Vaughn and his family for their contributions to the United States of America.,2015-03-17 19:10:59.822741,2015-03-17 19:10:59.822741,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL CLYDE A.

2711,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to rise today in support of House Resolution 483, a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day. Every day more and more brave Americans join the ranks of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and they deserve every ounce of praise we can possibly provide.I would like to thank my colleague, the Honorable John Kline from Minnesota, for introducing this important resolution. I would also like to thank Chairman Towns and my colleagues on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for bringing this bill to the floor.Just before the turn of the 20th century, the United States was called upon to defend the hemisphere in the Spanish-American War. American troops fought valiantly and emerged victorious in this, our first modern foreign conflict. On September 20, 1899, the American Veterans of Foreign Service was established to guarantee that troops receive the benefits to which they were entitled.The following decades demanded millions of young Americans, men and women, heed their Nation's call for service. War against fascism and tyranny in Europe, first in 1917, and again in 1941, proved that American soldiers are the greatest protectors of freedom in the world. When they returned home, the troops were greeted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars.The organization was and continues to be a vital advocate for veterans' well-being. It helped establish, among other things, the GI Bill, which provided college education for all veterans and fueled the greatest economic boom our Nation had ever seen.In 2008, the VFW was instrumental in passing a 21st century GI Bill to continue to provide educational assistance to servicemen and -women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.Today, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its auxiliaries represent 2.2 million veterans. With 8,100 locations worldwide, help is never far away from those who deserve it most.The Veterans of Foreign Wars' mission is to ``Honor the dead by helping the living.'' For 110 years they have done just that. For this, I send my personal gratitude.I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the invaluable work of the VFW and support House Resolution 483.I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:10:59.967815,2015-03-17 19:10:59.967815,House,SUPPORTING VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS DAY,2009-07-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-07-27/html/CREC-2009-07-27-pt1-PgH8844.htm,114,6,155,H8844-H8846,C001049,mr. clay
2712,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Well, I guess my point was the objective was already predetermined. It's a massive takeover of all kinds of basically building code stuff, telling you you've got to have an electric outlet in your garage. You know, this sort of incredibly detailed stuff that the Federal Government thinks we much better know how you ought to build your garage and have an electrical outlet in it. But the objective was all of this controlling stuff and a huge tax increase, which was the objective all along.This health care situation strikes me as the same thing. The objective from the beginning is get the government to run it, and we'll use any excuse that we can to justify the fact, but we already know the solution and the destination, and that is we just believe in the government running this thing.And there are a lot of people on the Democrat side that are completely open and honest and say that's their objective, and there are other people that are trying to obscure the fact that that's where they're going. We'll do it in some incremental steps, or we'll make it so that you can opt out. You can't opt out of the taxes, but you can opt out of the health care or whatever. But the bottom line is we want the government to run it.That kind of reminds me of something. And I know that a couple of you are historians. There was a country that believed, and we heard it argued on this floor, that health care is a right, and there was a country that took a look and said, you know, you ought to have a right to shelter because in the cold, harsh climate of this country, if you don't have shelter, you will die. And you ought to have a right to food because you'll starve to death if you don't have food. And you ought to have a right to health care and you ought to have a right also to education. So that country, because they thought those were fundamental rights, had the government providing those things for their citizens.,2015-03-17 19:11:00.100917,2015-03-17 19:11:00.100917,House,A TIME FOR AMERICANS TO RECLAIM THEIR FREEDOM,2009-11-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-11-03/html/CREC-2009-11-03-pt1-PgH12278.htm,162,60,155,H12278-H12285,A000358,mr. akin
2713,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.I rise in support of H.R. 1834, the National Ocean Exploration Program Act.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, is the Nation's lead agency charged with conserving and managing our coastal and oceanic resources. As such, relevant and high-quality research and development is vital to NOAA's ability to better understand the marine ecosystems it manages. NOAA's ocean exploration efforts have been organized in a systematic and strategic manner in order to investigate the farthest depths of the Earth's oceans. NOAA's undersea research programs allow for direct access to undersea environments through submersibles and indirect observation through the use of robots and sea-floor observatories. These programs provide invaluable information that enables us to learn more about our environment that covers more than two-thirds of our planet.H.R. 1834 authorizes two existing ocean programs: the Ocean Exploration Program and the National Undersea Research Program. Under this authorization, NOAA is required to work with the National Science Foundation to map out a coordinated national exploration program that promotes collaboration with other Federal ocean exploration programs to prevent duplicative efforts. This bill also requires NOAA to conduct an undersea research, exploration, education, and technology development program that coordinates with similar efforts of the academic and marine and ocean science communities.Most of these research and exploration efforts are conducted by outside groups who receive grants and funding from NOAA. H.R. 1834 requires that such funding shall now be distributed through a competitive bid process. Competition for funding will encourage existing research centers to select their most valuable research projects and partner with each other on other research programs. This competition is essential to ensure that the best research programs and ideas are adequately funded, something that, unfortunately, has not always been the case in the past.Madam Speaker, at a time when our Nation is struggling to divide resources among a greater number of programs, we cannot afford to allow spending on research programs that do not provide pertinent information related to NOAA's important mission. The authorizing of these two programs and the competitive grant process that is established in this bill will ensure that NOAA is able to fund only the most useful projects and leverage taxpayer dollars in a way that provides the most useful information to understanding and managing our ocean environment.I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1834.Madam Speaker, I would like to yield now such time as he may consume to my colleague Jim Saxton from the State of New Jersey. He has a long and very well-established reputation here, and, by the way, this is part of his legislation.,2015-03-17 19:11:00.235006,2015-03-17 19:11:00.235006,House,NATIONAL OCEAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM ACT,2008-02-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-02-13/html/CREC-2008-02-13-pt1-PgH896.htm,24,7,154,H896-H900,A000358,mr. akin
2714,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the budget he brings to the floor. I think it's clear, looking at that budget, that the specific cuts that have just been suggested don't have to be the cuts that are made. That's up to those committees.Now, I personally, as a former university president, would not go to student loans as the first thing to look at of all of the things that are in the Education and Labor Committee to decide what the Federal Government's doing that it could be doing better. This is a budget that's willing to take that kind of responsibility. This is a budget, a budget that's being presented by Mr. Ryan, that's willing to look at the things that otherwise will overwhelm us in the future.The mandatory spending in the Federal Government is going to be overwhelming if it is not dealt with. This budget deals with it. I had people yesterday, reporters, asking, well, how could you slow the growth of these mandatory programs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent? That would be $400 billion over 5 years.Now, the key is slow the growth. The other key is they would still grow by 3.8 percent. And the final key is we're going to have to look at these programs and not just think about them in terms of whether we care based on how much money we spend, but whether we care based on the service we provide.And we can look at these programs, as this budget anticipates we will, in a way that makes us look at health care so that people have more rights to have choices in health care, so they have more rights to their information in health care. We can look at health care. We can look at Social Security. We can look at things that provide a better service in a better way for taxpayers and recipients.Just simply not exceeding inflation as our goal doesn't mean we're going to provide worse service. It means we're going to really look at these programs seriously. This budget has the courage to do that. I rise in support of it and hope that my colleagues will join me.,2015-03-17 19:11:00.369107,2015-03-17 19:11:00.369107,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009,2008-03-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-03-13/html/CREC-2008-03-13-pt1-PgH1661.htm,43,8,154,H1661-H1684,B000575,mr. blunt
2715,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chairman, let me take this means to congratulate Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt, also a senior and well-respected member of the House Armed Services Committee, for crafting a strong, balanced budget for fiscal year 2009. I am pleased to support this bill that would provide for a strong national defense, would put our country on a path to budget surpluses in 2012, would promote tax relief for middle-class American families, and would invest in programs that have been priorities for those living in rural Missouri.On defense, the House Budget Resolution would prioritize resources to restore military readiness that has been worn down by repeated deployments and more than 6 years of war. The resolution would reject TRICARE fee increases, provide funding to continue addressing problems such as those identified at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and would call for enhanced pay and benefits to improve the quality of life of our troops and their families.On rural affairs, the House Budget Resolution would bolster commodity support, agricultural research, and animal and plant inspection programs. It would assume sufficient resources for the Farm Bill, which provides Missouri farmers with a secure economic safety. It would also set aside critical funds for rural development, for food and nutrition programs, and for conservation.Also important to Fourth District residents are commitments in the House Budget Resolution to infrastructure improvements, to local police and firefighters, to the health care needs of Missouri's senior citizens and low-income children, to education, and to our cherished veterans.The resolution would provide immediate and long-term relief from the alternative minimum tax and provide for additional middle-class tax relief and enhanced economic equity through tax policies. And, importantly, it would adhere to the ``pay-as-you-go'' rule adopted by House Democrats early in 2007. That rule requires new entitlement spending or revenue reductions to be offset so the budget remains in balance.On behalf of the rural Missourians I am privileged to represent, I am pleased to support Chairman Spratt's work product.The Acting CHAIRMAN. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises.Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Tauscher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Capuano, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent resolution (H.

2716,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Once again I stand as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 5395, which would rename the post office facility at 11001 Dunklin Drive in St. Louis, Missouri, after a true hero of mine: my beloved father, the Honorable William ``Bill'' Clay, Sr.The measure before us was first introduced by my friend and colleague Representative Russ Carnahan from my home State of Missouri on February 12, 2008. I am proud to say that the bill now enjoys the support and cosponsorship of nearly 60 Members of Congress, including the entire congressional delegation from the ``Show Me State'' of Missouri. H.R. 5395 was taken up by the House Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008, and reported out of the committee by voice vote that same day.Mr. Speaker, I'm sure you can imagine that in commemorating the achievements and accomplishments of my father, I could begin anywhere and probably go on endlessly. Throughout my lifetime I have been blessed to experience and witness firsthand my father's commitment to his community and his country.Congressman Clay served Missouri's First Congressional District for 32 years from 1968 to 2000. Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Bill Clay served in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955. Prior to his service in the U.S. House of Representatives, my father held the position of alderman in St. Louis from 1959 to 1964. And prior to that, he held jobs as a real estate broker, a labor coordinator, and a union affiliate for the St. Louis City Employees Union from 1961 to 1964 and an education coordinator for the Steamfitters Union up until 1967.During his tenure in Congress, Bill Clay became an advocate for environmentalism, labor issues, and social justice. Co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, he chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service from 1991 to 1995. His leadership in this policy arena serves as greater evidence for passing the measure at hand, which would name the Dunklin Drive post office in his honor. Upon retiring in 2000, I was fortunate and honored to pick up where my father left off representing Missouri's First Congressional District.Mr. Speaker, as we move to recognize the accomplishments of a great statesman, father, and to many of us friend, I ask that we pass the underlying bill without reservation and pay tribute to service and diligence rendered by Congressman Clay to this body over a 32-year period.

2717,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, let me recognize the service of Major General Randal R. Castro as his career comes to an end after 33 years of dedicated service in the United States Army.Major General Castro began his distinguished career upon graduation from the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York in 1975, where he received his bachelor's degree. In addition to a master's degree in civil engineering from Stanford University, his military education includes the Engineer Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, the U.S. Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and the U.S. Naval War College where he earned a master's degree in national security and strategic studies and subsequently served as a Professor.During his 33 years of service to the nation, Major General Castro held a variety of command and staff assignments. These range from the platoon to the army level, held engineer battalion and brigade command, served as Commanding General, U.S. Army Pacific and South Atlantic Engineer Divisions, and served as Special Assistant to the Commanding General, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Prior to assuming his current duties, Major General Castro served concurrently as Commandant, U.S. Army Engineer School, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Commanding General, U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center, also at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where he oversaw the Army's Engineer, Military Police and Chemical Schools.Major General Castro's decorations and awards include: the Distinguished Service Medal; Legion of Merit (with three oak leaf clusters); Meritorious Service Medal (with two oak leaf clusters); Army Commendation Medal (with four oak leaf clusters); Navy Commendation Medal; Army Achievement Medal; and the Parachutist Badge. Major General Castro currently serves as the Deputy Director, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

2718,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Madam Speaker, today I am honored to join with you and recognize the 75th anniversary of one of the most successful New Deal programs initiated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In the spring of 1933, while the United States was in the throes of the Great Depression, Congress and President Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps. CCC provided assistance to unemployed Americans by enrolling them in public works projects to better our Nation's infrastructure.The diverse mission of the CCC directed its participants to conduct public works projects throughout the entire United States. This was not a hand-out, but a hand-up, earned by Americans looking for help in dire economic circumstances. The CCC had a positive result in our region by not only upgrading the infrastructure, but by providing a means where young men and women could help themselves by earning a good living and improving their communities. Nationally, the ranks of the CCC would eventually swell to over 500,000 enrollees at one time.In southern Missouri, the CCC completed many projects. From cabins and trails at Big Spring, to a football stadium in Jackson, to sidewalks all over southern Missouri, the proof of the hard work and determination of CCC enrollees is still evident today. These projects instilled a strong work ethic into the participants of the CCC, which undoubtedly prepared this generation for the impending struggle that our Nation would face in World War II. Along with the work ethic implicit in the CCC, the program put enrollees to work in the community on basic education tasks like teaching, reading and writing to illiterate peers.While the CCC ceased to exist after the start of World War II, the concepts and principles established by the program would be reflected in future programs like Job Corps. It is important for our Nation to reflect on the origins of the CCC and the how it has made our Nation a better place to live by bettering the lives of both the participants and our entire Nation.,2015-03-17 19:11:01.034580,2015-03-17 19:11:01.034580,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS,2008-09-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-09-18/html/CREC-2008-09-18-pt1-PgE1838.htm,149,0,154,E1838,E000172,mrs. emerson
2719,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to discuss the question here about our dependence on foreign oil.The leadership in the House of Representatives because of the last election has changed, but the problems that confront our Nation remain the same. The question is how are we going to deal with our dependence on foreign oil, and that is a serious question for many reasons.Well, there are different ways to approach it, but it is certainly hard for the party of the Democrats that are now in charge to advocate a lot of nuclear because they have a lot of people who do not like that. Very well. And they really do not like burning a lot of fossil fuels because of global warming.Well, what tool are we going to use? Well, we use our favorite tool, a tax increase. The only trouble with a tax increase, though, is what it is going to do is it is going to make the problem worse because when you increase the taxes on American oil and gas by $10 billion you make it less competitive, and if they are less competitive that means OPEC fills in the gap.Now, is this just about the problem of $3 gasoline? The answer is no. It is about a lot more than that. When you go over to the Middle East, particularly a human rights trip that I took about a year or two ago to Pakistan, what you find is that there is a very nice country by the name of the Saudis who are funding private education so the little kids in Pakistan can learn. Well, until you find out what they are learning. They are being trained to be radical Islamic terrorists. And who is funding this? Saudi oil money, OPEC oil money.So this question before us today is not just about SUV owners paying $3 for gasoline. It is a question about where is that money going and the radical Islamists that we are going to fund essentially with this tax increase.So this is a bill that is trying to deal with a problem that is a serious problem, but a tax increase is not the way to go.,2015-03-17 19:11:01.156661,2015-03-17 19:11:01.156661,House,MOTION TO ADJOURN,2007-01-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-01-18/html/CREC-2007-01-18-pt1-PgH678.htm,10,280,153,H678-H729,A000358,mr. akin
2720,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, today, I honor John Bass, a much loved member of the St. Louis community, who died last month at the age of 80. John Bass was soft-spoken and low-key but he was also a fighter. As a young man, he served his country in the U.S. Navy. When he returned from service, he found himself living in a racially divided, socially and economically troubled city. Determined to bring change to his community, John literally fought his way through a college education. As a champion boxer, he won a boxing scholarship to Lincoln University. But John's true fight for St. Louis came long after he hung up his gloves.As an educator in Beaumont High School, John was a calming presence in a school bitterly divided by racial tension. There, at Beaumont, and probably for the first time in his life, John was sent to the principal's office the hard way. After he began his new job as principal of Beaumont High, he provided the calm, wise leadership that was necessary to soothe wounds that years of inequality inflicted on our Nation's educational system.John was already a distinguished member of the St. Louis community when he rolled up his sleeves and delved into politics to bring positive change to the city of St. Louis by shaping its policies. He did not come from a family of politicians, and he did not inherit a political power base. He came to politics as a thoughtful, practical, and hard-working man who wanted to make his community a better place to live. With these attributes, John Bass won the trust and respect of St. Louis.John served as an alderman, State senator, and cabinet official, but is best known for becoming the first African American to win the office of comptroller in St. Louis history. When he ran for that office in 1973, the mayor told him that the prevailing racial tensions in St. Louis would prevent his election. Undeterred, John ignored that prediction, won his seat, crashed his way into the city's most important financial post, and left his mark on the city of St. Louis. Regarded highly by his contemporaries as well as older and younger politicians, John helped pilot the city of St. Louis through some of its most turbulent years.With John's passing, we have lost a prolific public servant, a trusted friend, and a quiet but powerful leader. ,2015-03-17 19:11:01.278748,2015-03-17 19:11:01.278748,Senate,IN MEMORY OF JOHN F.

2721,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Mrs. William H. Weldon of Jefferson City, Missouri.Mrs. Weldon was born in Eagle Grove, Iowa, on February 22, 1922, daughter of Robert C. and Lenore Rhino Goshorn. She graduated from high school from the Mount Vernon Seminary, Washington, DC, in 1940 and went on to graduate Summa Cum Laude from Mount Holyoke College in 1943. After her college graduation, she returned to Jefferson City, Missouri, to work for the newspaper company which her father had purchased in In July 1956, she was united in marriage to William H. Weldon. William and Betty were the proud parents of 1 son, Frank Gifford Weldon, and 2 daughters, Lenore ``Tony'' Weldon and Sally Proctor.Mrs. Weldon was owner and publisher of the Jefferson City News Tribune, The Fulton Sun, and California Democrat. She was owner of Callaway Hills Stables, near New Bloomfield, and also the founder of KRCG-TV. In 1955, Mrs. Weldon became the first woman in the United States to launch a television station.Mrs. Weldon donated the first building space in Jefferson City to be used for the education of handicapped children; first known as the Goshorn Handicapped Center, it later merged with other schools to become the Special Learning Center. She was also active in many other community and national associations and groups, including service as a board member of the Jefferson City Family Y.M.C.A., the United Way of Central Missouri, the former Memorial Community Hospital Board of Governors, the St. Mary's Health Center Advisory Board, the Lincoln University Advisory Council, the Jefferson City Housing Authority, the Jefferson City Area Chamber of Commerce, the Missouri Welfare Association, and was responsible for the first cancer fund-raising drive in Missouri. At the national level, Mrs. Weldon was a member of the American Security Council, the American Saddlebred Horse Association, the American Quarter Horse Association, and was involved with the White House Conference on Children and Youth.Madam Speaker, she was a valuable leader in the community who was respected by everyone who knew her. She was a dear friend of mine and will be greatly missed. I know the members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to her family.,2015-03-17 19:11:01.422849,2015-03-17 19:11:01.422849,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF BETTY J.

2722,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing Isadore Erwin ``I.E.'' Millstone of Saint Louis, MO. It is an honor to celebrate I.E.'s centennial birthday and to pay tribute to all that he has accomplished in his 100 years. Through his business and philanthropic interests, Mr. Millstone has helped shape the course of the city of Saint Louis over the past century.Born on January 6, 1907, in North Saint Louis, I.E. graduated from Soldan High School in 1923. He then continued his education at Washington University in St. Louis, studying architecture and engineering, and graduating in 1927.During his life, I.E. has been an integral member and patriarch of the Saint Louis community. He is a life member of the United Hebrew Congregation in Saint Louis, where he earned money as a child checking hats and coats, and served as global president of the World Federation of YMHA's and Jewish Community Centers Association.Following the Great Depression, I.E. formed Millstone Construction Company with his wife and became involved in the creation of many landmarks throughout the Saint Louis area--due in part to his revolutionary use of reinforced concrete. These projects include the old Busch Stadium, Highway 40, and the Jewish Community center in Creve Coeur. As the city is being redeveloped, both the old Busch Stadium and Highway 40 are being transformed to serve a new generation, but the original structures are forever a part of the city's history.A giant among men, I.E. demonstrates a passion that does not lie solely in building Saint Louis from a physical standpoint. As a dedicated philanthropist, I.E. has supported many causes, including funding a program to support nearly 60 scholarships at Washington University in St. Louis. His dedication to helping others, however, is not limited to the Saint Louis area. Following World War II, I.E. joined a small group of builders to help the new State of Israel construct emergency housing for thousands of immigrants, many of whom were Holocaust survivors.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring I.E. Millstone for 100 years of dedicated service to Saint Louis and to the world. I am proud to recognize this extraordinary Missourian and wish him many more healthy and happy years to come. ,2015-03-17 19:11:01.559947,2015-03-17 19:11:01.559947,Senate,HONORING ISADORE ERWIN MILLSTONE,2007-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-05-16/html/CREC-2007-05-16-pt1-PgS6189-2.htm,81,0,153,S6189,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

Sharp will be leaving his position as Assistant Marine Corps Liaison to the House of Representatives and will be continuing his military education at the Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia.Major Sharp has been a valuable asset to the Marines since his enlistment in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1991. He attended the School of Infantry, Camp Geiger, MCB Camp Lejeune where he received the MOS of 0341 mortar man. He was assigned to Company G, 2nd Battalion, 25th Marines for 4 years and was accepted into Officer's Candidate School in 1995. He has also received a B.A. in History from Ramapo College in New Jersey and was selected for Career Level School through which he attended United States Army Field Artillery School, Captain's Career Course in April of Upon graduation from the Basic School, Major Sharp reported to the United States Army Field Artillery School and was designated a Field Artillery Officer. In his first tour, he reported to Battery E, 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines and served as forward observer, Guns Platoon Commander, and Executive Officer. During this tour, he was deployed to Okinawa, Japan in support of the 31st MEU (SOC). Major Sharp has also served as S-3A/Battalion Fire Direction Officer following the completion of his tour at 2nd Battalion, Target Information Officer for the 15th MEU Command Element, MEU Liaison to the United Nations for conducting operations to stabilize the new nation of East Timor in the spring of 2000, and Fire Support Officer following September 11, in which he assisted in the planning and execution of the seizure of Forward Operation Base Rhino, Afghanistan, to include combat operations.Upon his graduation from Career Level School, Major Sharp was assigned to Battery B, 1st Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment and served as Commanding Officer.

2724,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. I am pleased to be here as a part of this debate.I continue to hear as these debates go on that somehow these increases are not real increases, and I continue to be mystified by that. I think if my good friend from Georgia's amendment was approved, and I voted for his cutting amendment on each of these bills, if that amendment was approved, we would still have an increase in this bill of a little over 5 percent.Now, I don't know how that calculates out to not an increase, but I am continuing to try to figure out how that is not an increase. I do know that that increase of 5 percent anywhere that I talk to Americans is an increase. And I know, more importantly, in the course of today and tomorrow that what my friend from Georgia is suggesting is that if we let this one appropriations bill grow by 5 percent, as we move on later into the discussion of the farm bill, we would have saved enough money in this 1.4 percent cut not to have a tax increase that puts the farm bill in jeopardy.The farm bill is a bill that I voted for in the past and hope to vote for this year, but it is a bill that doesn't have to include a tax increase. But the $7.5 billion over 10 years that the farm bill needs could be gained right here if we would save $750 million of the increase in this bill.I just urge my colleagues to look at what we are doing here, realize that we are jeopardizing important things by moving forward in a way that spends more money than we have to spend this year.Most of these programs are good programs. I was a college president for 4 years. I believe in college education, in everybody having one. I don't believe that the reality is as stark as our friends on the other side would suggest. I believe a 5 percent increase used wisely would make all of these programs work effectively and for the American people, and we would be making the decisions we need to make for the other things we need to do.I support this amendment.,2015-03-17 19:11:01.882182,2015-03-17 19:11:01.882182,House,COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008,2007-07-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-07-26/html/CREC-2007-07-26-pt1-PgH8650-2.htm,121,12,153,H8650-H8675,B000575,mr. blunt
2725,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to join my colleague from Maryland, the House majority leader; to introduce the Best Buddies Empowerment for People with Intellectual Disabilities Act of 2007. As Mr. Hoyer will attest, this is not the first time we have come together in a meaningful way in this important area--and we were both proud when the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004 became law in the 108th Congress.It's estimated that between 7 and 8 million Americans live with intellectual disabilities, impacting nearly 1 out of every 10 families. For these individuals, life is not always welcoming--and very rarely is it easy. People with intellectual disabilities are often excluded from society--whether at school, in the workplace or in their communities--simply because of their differences. So I was glad to learn of a program called Best Buddies. This organization. founded in 1989 by Anthony Kennedy Shriver, helps integrate people with intellectual disabilities into mainstream society, end their social isolation, and embark upon productive, fulfilling lives. The Best Buddies program works with volunteers to establish meaningful friendships with their non-disabled peers in order to help increase the self-esteem, confidence, and abilities of people with and without intellectual disabilities. This is a program that has enhanced the lives of actual people by providing real and safe opportunities for one-on-one friendships and new options for employment.And while these activities may not sound like life-changing events to the average person, for individuals with intellectual disabilities, they make a world of difference. This bill helps accomplish that goal in a number of significant cant ways. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants or contracts with Best Buddies to conduct and expand its activities--with an eye on increasing the participation of individuals with intellectual disabilities, as well as to promote outreach programs. This bill will go a long way toward dispelling negative, hurtful stereotypes and make clear the extraordinary gifts that people with intellectual disabilities nonetheless possess and utilize. More important, it will help move people with intellectual disabilities from the margins of society to the mainstream of society.I am also pleased to note that this bill is budget neutral. The $10 million authorization in this bill is offset by repealing two programs that in the most recent fiscal year were funded at $10.4 million. I know Mr. Hoyer and I look forward to working with our colleagues to enact this bill into law, in the hope that we can help raise the hope and dignity of people with intellectual disabilities, and further empower their full participation in our communities.,2015-03-17 19:11:02.104340,2015-03-17 19:11:02.104340,Extensions,INTRODUCTION OF THE BEST BUDDIES EMPOWERMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ACT OF 2007,2007-12-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-12-19/html/CREC-2007-12-19-pt1-PgE2636.htm,195,0,153,E2636-E2637,B000575,mr. blunt
2726,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I offer my condolences on the passing of Coretta Scott King, who passed away at the age of 78. Indeed, I offer these remarks on behalf of all Missourians who have been touched by her legacy and that of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. A tireless champion and partner in her husband's work, Mrs. King's life represents an American story from which we can all draw strength. She never stopped working toward the prize God called her to achieve.Born in rural Alabama on April 27, 1927, Coretta Scott was the second child of Obadiah and Bernice Scott, hard working parents who wanted more opportunities than they had for their children. An ambitious student, Mrs. King graduated first in her high school class and continued her studies at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, OH. She had a passion for education and music and went on to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, following her graduation from Antioch.It was in 1952 in Boston where she met the man who would become her husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They were married the next year and eventually settled in Atlanta, where they reared their four children, Yolanda, Martin, Dexter, and Bernice. Mrs. King was by no means a bystander in the groundbreaking changes her husband worked to achieve. She was a partner in her husband's historic work to make this country whole.Following the murder of her husband in 1968, Mrs. King could have chosen to retreat into the privacy of her family. Indeed, in the aftermath of that tragedy, she was a widow who had the sole responsibility of raising four young children. But instead, Mrs. King bravely chose to continue her husband's work and his quest for racial equality. She worked tirelessly to have her husband's birthday memorialized as a national holiday and to establish the King Center, a lasting memorial and research institution dedicated to the Dr. King's principles of justice, equality, and peace.Mr. President, Coretta Scott King continued her work to bring this country together until her final days. She never stopped believing that we have a historic responsibility to move America forward and extend the American dream to all those who seek it, regardless of race. Today, as a nation, we mourn Mrs. King's passing. We are thankful for her time here with us, the fruits of her labor, and the profound impact she has left on a grateful country.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:02.260451,2015-03-17 19:11:02.260451,Senate,REMEMBERING CORETTA SCOTT KING,2006-02-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-02-01/html/CREC-2006-02-01-pt1-PgS440.htm,10,0,152,S440-S441,T000024,mr. talent

But, her service to our community did not end at that point. She continued to be a conscientious citizen and a neighborhood beacon--serving in a number of capacities including Neighborhood Watch and First Night Programs which she continues to this very day.Through the years, Mrs. Pritchett has given the full measure of her abilities, dedicated services and wise counsel to the St. Louis community. She gave tirelessly of her time as a Girl Scout Troup Leader at the All Saints Episcopal Church and later as a poll worker with the St. Louis County Board of Elections.

2729,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President. I take this opportunity to honor the life of Bob Duvall, not only out of great respect for his contributions to technology advancements in the defense industry but also for all of those who have played a key role in the strength of our Armed Forces and Nation's security. Warfighters and commanders among all service groups have directly benefited from his engineering contributions. Mr. Duvall passed away on May 24, 2006. He was 61.Duvall, III, was born in Cheverly, MD, on October 8, 1944 and grew up in the suburbs of Washington, DC. His father was an electrical engineer for the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company and inspired him to pursue a career in engineering. In 1967, he graduated from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, with a degree in electrical engineering and subsequently went to work at Hughes Aircraft Company in California. Mr. Duvall furthered his education with a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1975.After Mr. Duvall's placement within the defense industry, his technical expertise expanded to include a variety of disciplines, including circuit design, optics, infrared technology, optoelectronics, and systems integration. It was within the infrared technology and laser systems integration sector that his contributions made the most notable and recognized impact to the military capability of the United States. Early contributions and developments during his 20-plus years with Hughes Aircraft led to innovation in Naval and Air Force laser pointing and tracking technology. His contributions are better known for supporting the U.S. Army's Second Generation Forward Looking Infrared, FLIR, developments in the early 1990s.Mr. Duvall's pioneering efforts with Hughes Aircraft and subsequently his current position as vice president of advanced technology at DRS Technologies have indeed made a difference for our present generation of warfighters. Our sons and daughters enter into battle with the decisive ability to ``own the night'' and precisely target and defeat the threat because of the incredible contribution he made as a member of our defense industry. There is no doubt Mr. Duvall contributed directly to the saving of many lives and the avoidance of great loss because of his efforts and expertise.Mr. Duvall is survived by his wife Shirley and his two children Mark and Michelle.

2730,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a distinguished career has come to an end. LTG Michael M. Dunn is retiring from the U.S. Air Force.Lieutenant General Dunn received his Bachelor of Science degree in astrodynamics from the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, in 1972. After graduating fourth in his class in June 1972, General Dunn flew the F-106 at Castle Air Force Base, CA. Following various duties in Washington, DC, Florida, and Alabama, he transitioned to the F-15, which he flew in the Far East. He is a command pilot with more than 2,500 flying hours.In 1976, he went to the Squadron Officer School and later received his Master of Science degree in systems management at the University of Southern California in 1981. In 1983, he attended the Air Command and Staff College in Maxwell AFB, AL, and three years later attended the Air War College. In 1989, Lieutenant General Dunn attended the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, DC.Lieutenant General Dunn commanded the 1st Operations Group at Langley Air Force Base, VA. He was the Senior Military Fellow and is currently a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He has served in four joint tours, including the Headquarters U.S. European Command, the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Headquarters United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, and the Joint Staff. In Korea, he was the lead negotiator with the North Korean Army at P'anmunjom.Most recently, Lieutenant General Dunn served as president of National Defense University. He has provided strong leadership, coordinating the several schools with the National Defense University. During his tenure, the professional military education of our military made great strides forward.Lieutenant General Dunn's awards and decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, with oak leaf cluster, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, with three oak leaf clusters, and Air Force Commendation Medal, with two oak leaf clusters.Throughout his career, LTG Michael M. Dunn has served the Nation well. I am certain that my colleagues will join me in wishing Lieutenant General Dunn all the best in all the days ahead.,2015-03-17 19:11:02.827856,2015-03-17 19:11:02.827856,Extensions,LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL M.

2731,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it has been said that politics is the art of compromise.Today, the House is debating a bill that would designate a number of National Heritage Areas throughout the United States, including the Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area in western Missouri and eastern Kansas. That portion of the bill, which was drafted by my good friend from Kansas, Congressman Jim Ryun, is the product of much negotiation and compromise, and I am pleased to lend my support to it.As a student of history, I believe it is part of our government's responsibility to promote history education and to provide opportunities for the American people to learn about our nation's rich past. Doing so is critical to forming a more perfect union and to ensuring we do not repeat the mistakes of yesteryear.The people of Missouri and Kansas have contributed a great deal to our nation. In many ways, the border region has mirrored the finest and darkest days in American history. From the bloody border conflicts that set the stage for the Civil War to our mutual struggle to expand the definition of freedom, Missourians and Kansans have played a role in this history. In fact, two great leaders from this region, Harry S Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, descendants of pioneers, found common purpose on the larger stage of world history and led the wartorn nations of the 20th century toward the fulfillment of democracy's promise.The creation of the Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area will allow local and state historical groups and governments to more easily tell our interesting regional story. It will encourage collaborative planning on historical projects and provide important federal resource opportunities for historical preservation.I am pleased to have worked with Mr. Ryun on this bill and am especially grateful he agreed to a number of my suggested changes to his original legislation. The final work product will mean good things for the people of our great states and for the history of our country.The people of Missouri and Kansas have faced many challenges through the years, and our relationship has not always been as pleasant as it is today. But, through friendship and compromise, we will now more easily be able to explain our regional history in a way that is acceptable to both Missourians and Kansans.,2015-03-17 19:11:03.049011,2015-03-17 19:11:03.049011,House,NATIONAL HERITAGE AREAS ACT OF 2006,2006-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-07-24/html/CREC-2006-07-24-pt1-PgH5591.htm,98,21,152,H5591-H5615,S000465,mr. skelton
2732,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the achievements of Reverend Doctor Nelson ``Fuzzy'' Thompson, a minister, humanitarian, community activist, and a resident of the Fifth District of Missouri, which I am honored to represent. This week, Rev. Thompson is to be inducted into the Missouri Walk of Fame during a reception as part of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, an event held to honor the achievements of African-Americans who have made significant contributions to Missouri.Rev. Thompson graduated from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri with a Bachelor of Science in Education, and received a Master of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry at St. Paul School of Theology.Rev. Thompson's reputation as a community leader extends beyond the local or national level, but is inclusive of the international community. He was one of 22 U.S. ministers that traveled to South Africa on a fact finding educational exchange, at the request of Bishop Desmond Tutu, President Nelson Mandela, and the South African Council of Churches. ``Fuzzy,'' as he is affectionately known, was one of three U.S. ministers to conduct Easter services for U.S. hostages held in Tehran, Iran in 1980. He was also one of 17 U.S. ministers and activists who served as official observers for the first election ever held in South Africa that allowed the right to vote to all races. He said it was a humbling experience seeing people lining up the night before and standing for blocks in order to exercise their right to vote for the first time.``Fuzzy'' is currently President of the Kansas City Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He has served on multiple boards, including as Chairman of the Nominating Committee for Freedom Incorporated and as a member for the Black Adoption Program and Services, and Human Rights Commission of Kansas City, Missouri.For those reasons and more, it is indeed an honor and privilege to recognize ``Rev. Fuzzy'' at the Missouri Walk of Fame reception, hosted by myself and fellow Missourian, U.S. Representative Wm. Lacy Clay of St. Louis.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Reverend Dr. Nelson Thompson and his endless commitment to serving the residents of the State of Missouri. He is a true role model not just to the African-American community in Missouri, but to the entire community at large. May his success serve as a stepping stone for many other African-Americans eager to be just as successful in their endeavors. While it is but a small acknowledgement for all of the work he has done, it is a heartfelt gesture, taking strength from the many lives he has touched in our hometown.,2015-03-17 19:11:03.183108,2015-03-17 19:11:03.183108,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF REV.

2733,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, as well as my friend and chairman, Chairman Shuster of Pennsylvania. I thank them both for their support of this bill.I rise in support of H.R. 1556, a bill to designate a park in the City of St. Louis in honor of the late Judge Clyde S. Cahill.Judge Cahill served on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri for more than two decades, appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1980. Judge Cahill was the first African American to serve in the eighth circuit court.The Honorable Clyde S. Cahill, Jr., was a native St. Louisian. He graduated from Vashon High School and served in the U.S. Air Force during World War II. He went on to graduate from St. Louis University and St. Louis University School of Law.Early in his legal career, Mr. Cahill served as chief legal adviser to the Missouri office of the NAACP and filed the first lawsuit in the State of Missouri calling for enforcement of the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. The Board of Education.Throughout his career, Clyde Cahill demonstrated a deep commitment to improving the quality of life in the African American community. He was a leader in the struggle for civil rights, and he was active in many domestic programs to help the poor and disadvantaged.In 1966, he joined the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity, and later he went to work for the St. Louis Human Development Corporation. He also served as executive director and general counsel for the Legal Society of St. Louis, where he played a pivotal role in expanding legal aid services throughout eastern Missouri. Judge Cahill was truly a dedicated public servant who spent his life pursuing justice and equality for others.Today, throughout St. Louis, Judge Cahill is fondly remembered for his courteous style and his compassionate heart. He was a hardworking man with a generous spirit who helped to improve the lives of countless citizens, some who knew him well and others who never even met him. Judge Cahill's contributions will benefit generations, and St. Louisians will forever cherish his memory.I also want to add, Mr. Speaker, that I grew up knowing Judge Cahill going to school with his children. We are friends to this day. I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 1556, a bill to designate a site at the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse as the Clyde S.

2734,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important role science plays in our society. Today, October 3, has been proclaimed ``Science Day'' by Missouri Governor Matt Blunt along with various mayors throughout southern Missouri.``Science Day'' is important because American innovation depends upon a strong foundation in the sciences. Statistics indicate the United States is falling behind other nations in science education. Japan, China, and South Korea produce more engineering graduates than the United States. Twenty years ago, the United States, Japan, and China each graduated a similar number of engineers. South Korea at the time graduated roughly half as many engineering graduates. By the year 2000, China increased engineering graduates by 161 percent, Japan effected a 42 percent increase and South Korea increased graduates by more than 140 percent. Meanwhile, the number of U.S. engineering graduates declined 20 percent. If this trend continues, by 2010 more than 90 percent of all scientists and engineers in the world will live in Asia.Science and technology-related employers continue searching overseas to find qualified engineers and scientists because our Nation is simply not producing enough graduates in the engineering and science disciplines. ``Science Day'' aims to bring attention to this problem and encourage action among parents, teachers and community members.Science not only offers economic and advancement opportunity, it is also fun and exciting. Inside and outside the classroom, science offers an awe-inspiring window into the origins, workings and future of our physical world. By engaging students in this intriguing subject, parents and teachers foster exploration and enable them to reach their academic potential.I commend this effort to raise awareness of the importance of science educators. I want to thank the staff at KFVS News for their efforts in promoting the recognition of ``Science Day.'' By partnering with educators and community leaders, KFVS News has organized events and competitions designed to challenge students and emphasize the importance of science. On ``Science Day,'' I join Missouri's community leaders in challenging our Nation's parents, guardians, grandparents, and other family members to do a simple science experiment with their children, to honor science teachers in their community and to recognize scientific contributions and their important roles in the future of our country.,2015-03-17 19:11:03.483314,2015-03-17 19:11:03.483314,Extensions,OCTOBER 3RD PROCLAIMED ``SCIENCE DAY'',2006-09-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-09-29/html/CREC-2006-09-29-pt1-PgE1985.htm,125,0,152,E1985,E000172,mrs. emerson
2735,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize the outstanding service of Robert L. Goldich, a Specialist in National Defense with the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service. Mr. Goldich is retiring after 33 years at CRS. During this time, he has provided Members of Congress with perspective and analysis on a broad range of topics in military manpower and personnel policy, military history, Department of Defense organization, prisoner of war (POW) and missing in action (MIA) issues, and major aspects of overall U.S. defense policy.During his career, Mr. Goldich excelled at working with Members of Congress and congressional staff on many issues. He is an expert on such issues as military retirement, military compensation and benefits, officer personnel management, military education and training; as well as the draft and all-volunteer force, military reserve components and the National Guard, and U.S. defense organization and management including the Goldwater-Nichols Act and the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act. He received a CRS commendation for his service to Congress in 1987, and in 1991 he received a CRS meritorious award for his service to Congress during the Persian Gulf War. He is the second youngest person ever to graduate from the National War College.Mr. Goldich also served twice as head of CRS's Military Manpower, Budget and Policy Management Section and was responsible for providing to Congress analytical capability on a variety of defense issues associated with the Department of Defense's budget and policy priorities. He received many accolades as a supervisor and lead with dedication, analytical skill, clear thinking, and fair-minded approach in working with members of the Section. In addition to his work for Congress, Mr. Goldich's outside professional activities are impressive. He was invited to participate in high level conferences, writing book reviews for the Army Center of Military History, and having longtime participatory memberships to the Inter-Agency Seminar Group and the Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society.Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Mr. Goldich for his many years of service and his many contributions to congressional deliberations on defense related issues.

2736,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Cary Crane--the recipient of the 2005 Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Award. Mr. Crane and his company, Apple &amp; Eve, have for years been generous enough to provide juice beverage products to the nation's less fortunate through Rock and Wrap It Up! Inc., a nonprofit, nonpartisan hunger relief organization Bill helped to found.Mr. Crane has been a true public servant in supplying nutritious food to those in need. He is the Cofounder and Executive Vice President of Apple &amp; Eve, LLC a manufacturer of premium fruit juices, which donates heavily to Rock and Wrap It Up! to further their cause. This is just one area of service and philanthropy in Mr. Crane's life. He is also involved with many other charitable organizations, such as the Education Assistance Corporation, the American Diabetes Association, and Big Brothers/Big Sisters.Through his efforts, Mr. Crane is helping to advance the vision of my husband, Bill Emerson, for domestic food aid programs when he worked to pass the Good Samaritan Food Act, a law protecting these donations from liability. Bill's hopes for hunger relief in America were very high when he worked to make Rock and Wrap It Up! possible in 1990. Following in his dream, Mr. Crane is an ideal recipient of the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Award.Rock and Wrap It Up! is a volunteer hunger relief charity, which has fed over 20 million since its inception. With over 4,000 volunteers in 500 cities across America, its dedicated supporters recover food in schools, colleges, music concerts, sporting events, and political and corporate functions. Rock and Wrap It Up! was adopted by resolution in 2003 by the United States Conference of Mayors to teach its successful strategies to cities to fill America's food pipeline to feed the indigent.Cary Crane and Apple &amp; Eve are a major reason the program continues to gain notoriety and grow. They are proof that our commitment to feed America's hungry can always use new initiative and better ideas. As long as there are men, women, and children who need the helping hand of other Americans, we are glad that there are gentlemen like Mr. Crane.Thank you for your kind service to our nation, Mr. Crane.

2737,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Juanita R. Phillips, a retired St. Louis Public School educator and the aunt of my colleague and dear friend, Congresswoman Diane Watson. Ms. Phillips died of natural causes on July 1, 2004, less than three months shy of celebrating her 100th birthday. Born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 26, 1904, she experienced many highs and lows of this great country's history, witnessing historic events from both World Wars and the Great Depression to landing astronauts on the Moon. She attended the Clinton, Iowa Public Schools, graduated from the University of California-Los Angeles in 1927 and earned a master's degree in English from Ohio State University. She was a pioneer and a model for women of her day and today.Ms. Phillips pursued a rewarding career teaching English at historically black institutions such as Florida A&amp;M College in Tallahassee, Florida and the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, before moving to St. Louis, Missouri in 1943 with her husband, Dr. A.C. Phillips. Ms. Phillips followed her love for teaching English to Soldan High School in the St. Louis Public School system, from which she retired in 1972, and subsequently served as a tutor.In her years as an educator Ms. Phillips touched many lives. One of those lives is that of her niece, my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Diane Watson. Diane has followed in the footsteps of her Aunt Juanita by devoting her life to community service, first as a teacher and school board member, and then as a California State Senator and later as U.S. Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia. Diane has been a role model to other women just as Aunt Juanita was for her.Juanita Phillips was truly an exemplary American. She overcame obstacles of racism and hatred to ensure a better life for her family and future generations. The challenges she faced as an African American educator through the years of segregation in our country were difficult to overcome, but Juanita didn't give up. She was undaunted by her commitment to making her world a better place, and she succeeded in doing so for all of us.Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the life of a woman who dedicated her life to education and to making sure future generations could realize their dreams. There are lessons to be learned from someone who gave so much to so many.

I am pleased to be a sponsor of this historic legislation to provide support to the Special Olympics organization founded by Eunice Shriver over three decades ago and to the thousands of athletes who participate in these games.This authorization proves the commitment of the United States Congress to this positive organization and all of its participants. Special Olympics is an international organization dedicated to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities who become physically fit, productive and respected members of society through sports training and competition.Special Olympics has become an important vehicle and platform for breaking down artificial barriers, improving public health, changing negative attitudes in education, and helping athletes overcome the prejudice that people with their disabilities often face.Special Olympics provides year-round sports training and competitive opportunities for nearly 1.5 million athletes in 26 different sports. In my home State of Missouri, Special Olympics serves nearly 14,000 athletes ranging from 8 to 80 years old.With the resources we hope to authorize today, Special Olympics plans to expand participation to hundreds of thousands of people worldwide over the next 5 years. These new resources will also help Special Olympics continue the vision, dental, hearing, and nutritional health screenings they currently provide for their athletes. These services are handled entirely by volunteer health professionals and are critical to enhancing the lives of people who might otherwise go completely without care.Finally, these resources will allow students of all abilities the chance to learn about differences and engage in creating local Special Olympics teams and events as part of a school-based curriculum. Children and adults with intellectual disabilities who participate in Special Olympics develop improved physical fitness and motor skills, greater self-confidence, and a more positive self-image.I would like to thank my colleague across the aisle, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip, for his leadership on this issue. It is probably not as often as it should be that Democrats and Republicans, Senators and House Members stand together in total agreement on an issue of this importance. We have worked hard with our friends in the other body to see that that happens.The government of the United States of America enthusiastically supports Special Olympics and recognizes its importance in improving the lives of people with intellectual disabilities, and I urge my colleagues to move forward and pass this legislation at the end of our debate.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:04.749221,2015-03-17 19:11:04.749221,House,SPECIAL OLYMPICS SPORT AND EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 2004,2004-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-10-06/html/CREC-2004-10-06-pt2-PgH8311-3.htm,125,9,150,H8311-H8314,B000575,mr. blunt

I am pleased to be part of this bipartisan effort to make Special Olympics officially something recognized and encouraged by the United States Government.Dear Mr. Blunt: On behalf of our athletes, families, volunteers, and staff around the world, I would like to thank you for your leadership in introducing the historic ``Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004,'' H.R. 5131 that will authorize $15 million per year for the next 5 years to support the expansion of Special Olympics programs. We are equally elated that Senator Santorum is leading the effort to pass the companion bill in the Senate. We consider it an honor that you recognize Special Olympics as a responsible and accomplished steward of federal funding. Indeed, millions of individuals with intellectual disabilities, as well as their families and countless communities, have benefited from our programs. Passage of the ``Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004'' will allow us to substantially expand these successful programs, including Healthy Athletes. As you know, Healthy Athletes provides much needed health care screenings and services to address preventable secondary health conditions such as obesity, poor fitness, nutritional deficiencies, untreated or poorly treated vision, and dental, hearing, and podiatric problems. Expansion of the program is particularly important since people with intellectual disabilities have a 40% higher risk of the health conditions referenced above. I understand that some concern has been raised that the funding contained in H.R. 5131 may be used for abortion, abortion referral, or sex education. Please be assured that Special Olympics has not provided nor referred such services in the past; we would never use federal funds for such a purpose. I would be happy to discuss such concerns with you or your colleagues if necessary. Thank you again for your leadership. Sincerely, Timothy P. Shriver, Ph.D., Chairman &amp; CEO.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:04.928370,2015-03-17 19:11:04.928370,House,SPECIAL OLYMPICS SPORT AND EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 2004,2004-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-10-06/html/CREC-2004-10-06-pt2-PgH8311-3.htm,125,16,150,H8311-H8314,B000575,mr. blunt
2742,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, I rise today to support legislation that will strengthen the Corporation for National and Community Service's AmeriCorps program. The Strengthen AmeriCorps Program Act of 2003 is a bipartisan bill that I introduce with my colleague and good friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and a number of my other colleagues. As the ranking member and chair of the Corporation's appropriations committee and members of the authorizing committee, Senator Mikulski and I believe that this bill will not only address the Corporation's accounting problems, but more importantly, it will protect and expand volunteer service opportunities across our Nation.Many of my colleagues have heard from their constituents and the media in recent weeks about the potential cuts to the AmeriCorps program. This bill addresses those concerns and the long-standing concerns about the management and financial problems of the Corporation by creating a budgeting mechanism that ensures the Corporation has the funds needed to pay educational awards. Under our bill, the Corporation would be able to enroll about 50,000 AmeriCorps members, without the need for additional funds.As many of my colleagues know, the President has asked every American to volunteer in their communities and has made the AmeriCorps program a central vehicle in meeting volunteer needs. I support the President's call to service and if harnessed in the right fashion, the AmeriCorps program can play an important and effective role in improving the lives of many Americans and communities it serves.The Corporation, unfortunately, has been plagued by significant and long-standing management problems that have been neglected for several years. One notable result of this neglect has been the inappropriate and illegal practice of enrolling more AmeriCorps members than the Corporation had budgeted. According to the Corporation's Inspector General, the number of approved AmeriCorps volunteer positions for program years 2000, 2001, and 2002, were approximately 59,000, 61,000, and 67,000, respectively, even though its budget estimates were based on enrollment levels that were around 50,000. Last year, the Corporation over-enrolled the AmeriCorps program by more than 20,000. Fortunately, the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittees were able to provide $43 million more than requested in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations bill to meet the needs of these members and more. Because of continued poor budgeting practices, the VA-HUD Subcommittee also approved another $64 million in a deficiency appropriation in the fiscal year 2003 supplemental appropriations to cover additional shortfalls.When the over-enrollment problem first surfaced, I immediately asked the General Accounting Office and the Corporation's Inspector General to review the accounting practices of the Corporation and its internal controls to determine the causes of this problem. Further, I asked the GAO's Comptroller General to review the Corporation's underlying statute to determine whether the Corporation's practices complied with this law and other fiscal laws such as the Antideficiency Act.Both the GAO and the IG found that the Corporation did not comply with the law by incorrectly recording its funding obligations. In a statement for the record for the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on April 10, 2003, GAO identified several factors that led to the Corporation's incorrect accounting practice. The factors included inappropriate obligation practices, little or no communication among key Corporation executives, too much flexibility given to grantees regarding enrollments, and unreliable data on the number of AmeriCorps participants.The GAO also found that the Corporation was not following the law in recording its legal liabilities. The GAO's finding is described in the Comptroller General's two legal opinions that were issued on April 9, 2003--B-300480, and June 6, 2003--B-300480.2. The first opinion concluded that the Corporation incurs a legal liability for the award of educational benefits of AmeriCorps participants when it enters into a grant agreement. At the time it enters a grant agreement, the Corporation approves a specified number of new participants in the AmeriCorps program. By this action:the Corporation incurs a legal duty that once fully matured, by action of the grantee and participants outside the Corporation's control, will require the Corporation to pay education benefits to qualified participants from the National Service Trust.The Comptroller General opinion further states that as:the Corporation incurs an obligation for education benefits, it must record the obligation against the budget authority available in the Trust.In other words, to ensure compliance with the law, the Corporation must record and track its obligations based on the value of the educational award multiplied by all approved positions.We understand that recording obligations based on the approved level of AmeriCorps members in the program does not reflect the true performance of the program. We know from historical data that not all AmeriCorps volunteers successfully complete service. We also know that not all AmeriCorps members who successfully complete service use their educational award benefit. Accordingly, this bill recognizes the realities of the AmeriCorps program and allows the Corporation to maximize the number of AmeriCorps that can participate in the program.In short, the bill allows the Corporation to fund AmeriCorps grants based on estimates of the number of members who will likely complete and use their education award. Further, the bill requires an annual actuarial audit of the National Service Trust to ensure that the Federal Government is able to meet its liabilities. The bill also requires the chief executive officer to certify that the Corporation has properly recorded and tracked its obligations.To ensure that the AmeriCorps program is accountable to the taxpayer and its volunteers, it is our expectation that the Corporation will use conservative assumptions in developing its funding formula. This especially is important since the Corporation has repeatedly failed to meet funding obligations resulting in actions by the Congress to provide additional funding, including a deficiency appropriation. While the program has been in place for about 10 years, there is little data on the performance of the program. Until there is reliable data, I strongly believe that the Corporation should assume a 100 percent enrollment rate for every volunteer slot approved in the grant agreements. I also believe that the Corporation should assume at least an 80 percent earnings rate for the program and at least an 80 percent education award usage rate. Further, because of poor data, the bill requires a central reserve fund to give the Corporation an extra cushion in case the actual usage rate exceeds the assumptions used in the formula.It is my hope that we can pass this legislation as quickly as possible. This legislation provides clarification for the Corporation in determining grant award allocations to its grantees and the states. Without this legislation, uncertainty and disagreement will delay and limit the enrollment of AmeriCorps volunteers. Considering the demand and the need for this program, we cannot afford to wait.We designed this legislation with input from the administration. I think it is a reasonable and fair approach to address this issue. It mitigates harm to AmeriCorps programs in a manner that will ensure accountability and fiscal integrity in the programs. Keeping in mind the problems identified by the auditors, which led to the enrollment freeze last November, we designed this legislation to ensure that we do not repeat those past mistakes. The enrollment freeze was an unfortunate but avoidable mistake if the Corporation had properly managed and monitored its programs.Finally, we need to put these enrollment issues behind us. This program has had a difficult and star-crossed history, and it is unfortunate that we are here in June revisiting the implementation of the program to ensure both accountability and credibility. We need to ensure that the State and local programs are meeting both program requirements and community needs.Before closing, I want to raise a technical issue regarding the enrollment cap of 50,000 AmeriCorps members. The Corporation enrolls members based on full-time equivalent or FTE levels since some AmeriCorps members serve part-time and others serve full-time. The cap should be based on FTE levels so that it is consistent with normal AmeriCorps business practices.I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and pass it as quickly as possible. Senator Mikulski and I have tried to construct this bill in a thoughtful and fair manner to address the concerns about the program. This bill ensures that volunteers across this Nation and the taxpayers will have confidence in the AmeriCorps program.,2015-03-17 19:11:05.116482,2015-03-17 19:11:05.116482,Senate,STRENGTHEN AMERICORPS PROGRAM ACT,2003-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-06-18/html/CREC-2003-06-18-pt1-PgS8163-3.htm,90,4,149,S8163-S8165,B000611,mr. bond
2743,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to one of our nation's most outstanding organizations, a group recognized as both the largest women's and the largest Jewish membership organization in the United States, Hadassah. Hadassah is a name that has come to be synonymous with strength of purpose and humanitarianism. The women of Hadassah are a force for change with an unchanging commitment to serving human needs.Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, recently celebrated its 90th anniversary. Throughout its long history, the women of Hadassah have exemplified the highest ideals of civic awareness and action. They have long combined an agenda of vital international and domestic issues. Proponents of a strong Israeli nation and a peaceful Middle East, they are also champions of fundamental social and domestic programs.In many ways, Hadassah exemplifies the heart and soul of our democratic society--active involvement in public policy making and civic life. The Hadassah members have successfully channeled their remarkable energies toward an agenda that spans from education and health care, to religious freedom and social justice, to energy and the environment. They are genuinely devoted to serving the human cause.In so many fundamental ways our nation changed forever last September 11, and we have begun a new chapter in our history. As leaders in Congress, we strive to restore the strength of the American spirit and confidence that was eclipsed by the terrorist events. In this role I am inspired by the women of Hadassah. They have long exercised a very special and unique commitment to domestic and international issues. They are an organization of courageous women whose faith, perseverance and strength of purpose flourishes and thrives in the face of challenge and adversity. I salute Hadassah for its longstanding commitment to enhancing the quality of life for both the people of the United States and the people of Israel. Hadassah members are a source of inspiration and guidance for all Americans as we strive to meet the challenges of achieving peace and domestic security in the years ahead.,2015-03-17 19:11:05.406681,2015-03-17 19:11:05.406681,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO HADASSAH,2002-03-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-03-07/html/CREC-2002-03-07-pt1-PgE296.htm,24,0,148,E296,C001049,mr. clay
2744,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Texas (Chairman Combest) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm), for the excellent and diligent work they did on a most challenging bill.I would like to just remind my colleagues to harken back to the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill and the fact that it was going to decrease subsidies, so to speak. But it was also based on three major components: number one, we would have lower taxes; number two, we would have fewer regulations; and, number three, we would have more markets in which to sell our commodities.We all know Freedom to Farm did not work. We do not have fewer regulations; we have more. We do not have more markets; we have the same or fewer. And while no farmer wants to depend on the government for anything, it is critical that we provide a safety net to our producers.I only wish that our colleagues who oppose this bill because of subsidies, and most of those folks I do want to say represent suburban districts, I wish that they would understand that in the United States we have a very cheap food policy. We spend 11 cents of every dollar on food, while in Europe they spend about 22 cents. In Russia they spend about 50 cents. We are very, very fortunate.We have the safest, most abundant food supply anywhere in the world. I think that the conferees have done a remarkable job on this bill, given all of the challenges posed to them.I do want to say one thing to our colleague from Oregon who said that we decrease funds for conservation. In fact, we increase funds by 80 percent. So that is incorrect.Let me also take one moment to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for the steadfast commitment he has had and the work he has done on the Global Food for Education initiative. I greatly appreciate that work he has done, as well as our conferees, in funding this very, very important initiative that will help poor children in countries go to school and also get the nourishment they need.Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is important that we support it and certainly vote down any motion to recommit.,2015-03-17 19:11:05.571804,2015-03-17 19:11:05.571804,House,FARM SECURITY AND RURAL INVESTMENT ACT OF 2002,2002-05-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-05-02/html/CREC-2002-05-02-pt1-PgH2022.htm,53,33,148,H2022-H2057,E000172,mrs. emerson
2745,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and exceptionally distinguished career has come to an end. Lt. Col. James Ahrens has retired as Director of Institutional Research from Wentworth Military Academy and Junior College in Lexington, MO.Lt. Col. Ahrens has led a life of serving his family, community and country. In 1962, he graduated from Grinnell College, Iowa, with a history degree and entered the United States Air Force as a radar controller and public affairs officer. While in the United States Air Force, James received a master's degree in Public Relations from the School of Public Communications at Boston University. He retired from all military service in 1995.Lt. Col. Ahrens arrived at Wentworth in January of 1982 to teach social science courses in the junior college division. While at Wentworth, he joined the 418th Civil Affairs Company in Grandview, MO, after receiving a direct commission in the United States Army Reserve as a Civil Affairs Officer. Lt. Col. Ahrens mobilized and commanded this unit as it served in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Turkey during Operations Desert Storm and Provide Comfort in 1991. He served as a detachment commander, company executive officer and commander before the end of his tour.During his years at Wentworth, he served as Assistant/Associate Dean, managing the Junior College from 1989 through academic year 1994. He served as acting Dean of Continuing Education until January 1995. He was also assigned as Director of Institutional Research from 1995 through May 2001. Lt. Col. Ahrens also coached soccer, track, was a sponsor of the Civil War Living History Club and assisted with academic competition for high school students for a number of years.Lt. Col.

2746,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to explain that while I wholeheartedly support extending the current moratorium on Internet access taxes, I must oppose this amendment.I believe that we should, and I am confident that we will, pass legislation this year that extends the moratorium on Internet access taxes. However, I think it is crucial that the legislation we pass to extend the ban on access taxes also address the ability of states to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes.The Internet is still a growing and dynamic innovation and I believe that we must ensure that its development is not encumbered by discriminatory taxation. However, as the Internet becomes an increasingly important medium for the transaction of commerce, an unlevel playing field is emerging. While sales transacted at main street businesses are subject to state sales taxes, goods sold over the Internet are often free of such taxes.This creates two distinct problems. First, brick-and-mortar retailers are being subjected to a competitive disadvantage as consumers are able to purchase goods over the Internet without having to pay state sales tax on them. This situation provides a disincentive to shop at traditional retail locations and could have very negative long-term consequences for main street retailers.The second problem is that state and local governments rely on sales tax revenues for education, transportation infrastructure, law enforcement services, fire protection and more. The rise in untaxed electronic commerce is eroding state and local governments' revenue bases and may eventually compromise their ability to provide these essential services.Therefore I believe that we must address the issue of the collection of state sales taxes, and I fear that if this amendment is adopted, the impetus to deal with such issues will be diminished.I look forward to the opportunity to support an extension to the current moratorium in the context of a larger bill that also deals with the ability of states to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes.,2015-03-17 19:11:06.432416,2015-03-17 19:11:06.432416,Senate,RESTORING EARNINGS TO LIFT INDIVIDUALS AND EMPOWER FAMILIES (RELIEF) ACT OF 2001,2001-05-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-21/html/CREC-2001-05-21-pt1-PgS5185-8.htm,70,372,147,S5185-S5256,C001043,mrs. carnahan

Jenkins, Jr., Deputy for Acquisition and Business Management for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the very near future, Admiral Jenkins will retire after over 30 years in the U.S. Navy. He has distinguished himself, the Navy, and our nation with dedicated service.Admiral Jenkins began his service in the military in 1966, when he enlisted in the Naval Reserve. Throughout his career, Admiral Jenkins has continued his formal education. He received a bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University. He received masters degrees from the Naval Post Graduate School and is a graduate of the University of Southern California Program for Executives.Admiral Jenkins has held many command assignments and honorably served the American people throughout the world. Admiral Jenkins has served on the U.S.S. Savannah, U.S.S. Raleigh, and U.S.S. Puget Sound. He has also served as Supply Officer and Comptroller, Ship Repair Facility, Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines; Procuring Contracting Officer for the A06E TRAM and Business and Financial Manager of the CH-46 and CH-53 Marine helicopters, Naval Air Systems Command, Washington, As Director of Contracts at Navy Supply Center, Jacksonville, Florida, and while working at the Aviation Supply Office, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he championed the use of electronic bulletin boards in contracting. Admiral Jenkins also served as Executive Director for Procurement at the Defense Logistics Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he was responsible for the implementation of the electric commerce mall on the World Wide Web, significantly reducing unnecessary Department of Defense logistics infrastructure.Through his work in Navy acquisition, Admiral Jenkins has consistently reached out to communities and to small business owners throughout the United States and has helped bridge the gap between military and civilian America. Admiral Jenkins, through his unique and amiable style, has worked to make this intimidating process easier for Americans to understand. I am especially grateful to Admiral Jenkins for traveling to Warrensburg, Missouri, to take part in my annual Federal Procurement Conference held each year at Central Missouri State University.

Colonel Jeffrey A. Waite will take off his uniform for the last time this month as he retires from the National Guard on July 31st, 2001, following 32 years of service.Colonel Waite is a fifth generation Missourian who makes our State proud. He began his career by enlisting in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1969 and continued to excel as he climbed through the ranks to Colonel. He imparted his love of the State and to the military to his son, who is now the sixth generation of Waite's to serve our Nation's military. He is a proud Missourian and American.Colonel Waite completed his initial training at Ft. Bragg, NC and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD in the spring of 1970 and was commissioned through the Missouri Military Academy Officer Candidate School as a Second Lieutenant of Field Artillery in 1972. He holds a bachelor of science degree in business administration from Southwest Missouri State College and a master of science in business administration from Boston University. In addition, his military education includes the Ordinance Officer Basic and Advanced courses, U.S. Marine Corps Staff Course, U.S. Army Command and General Staff Course, the Air War College, and the Army War College.Throughout his career, Colonel Waite has held a variety of positions at nearly every level of the Army National Guard.

Shortly after graduation, he joined the Marines and served a tour in Vietnam during his three years on active duty. In 1969 he returned to civilian life and enrolled at Central Missouri State University at Warrensburg where he also was a member of the track team. He graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in education. After completing his student teaching at Odessa High School, Delbert worked for the local water company in Lexington while waiting for a permanent teaching position to become available.In January 1975, Delbert took a job teaching science in the Wellington-Napoleon School District. That spring, he began his association with the varsity high school track team as their assistant coach. He was named head coach the next year and the school won its first I-70 Conference boys track meet and the school's first district track championship the year after that. He coached the boy's track team to the state championships in 1985, 1987 and 1991. They took second place in 1986 and 1987, and third place in 1993 and 1996. The girls' track teams took second at the state championships in 1992 and third in 1993.Delbert has been honored for his commitment to coaching many times. He was named the State 1A Boys Track Coach of the Year eight times and the State 1A Girls Track Coach of the Year three times. In 1994, he was recognized as the Region 5 National Boys Track Coach of the Year, which included not only Missouri, but six other midwestern states.

2750,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to express concerns about HR 3709, the Internet Nondiscrimination Act, a bill which extends the moratorium contained in The Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 for five additional years until 2006.As a former Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the Missouri state house and former president of National Council of State Legislators (NCSL), I believe we need to address this issue with an eye toward creating a win-win situation for our states and localities, our mom and pop retailers on Main Street and the technology sector. I am not convinced that this bill has balanced all interests in a manner which achieves that goal.I want electronic commerce to prosper and I support eliminating discriminatory taxes on this type of commerce. However, I also support finding a way to ensure Main Street businesses and state and local governments are not penalized by competitive advantages enjoyed by internet commerce companies. We need a level playing field and I am committed to finding one.Not leveling the playing field could result in billions of dollars in lost revenue to states. By 2003 states will lose a total of approximately $20.1 billion in revenue if businesses are not required to collect the use taxes that are owed by purchases on electronic commerce. My state of Missouri will lose a projected $395 million--how will Missouri make up that revenue stream to ensure adequate funds for public education, critical infrastructure needs and other important state programs?The piecemeal approach in HR 3709 prevents comprehensive solutions to the subject of taxes on the Internet. The existing moratorium does not expire until October 21, 2001. Merely extending the moratorium does not address the main issue of providing a level playing field for sales tax collection. In the coming 17 months which remain in the existing moratorium, we must consider comprehensive solutions.Without a measured and thoughtful approach to addressing this complex issue we jeopardize the basic services which our constituents rely upon from our states and localities. We must sustain growth of the Internet and e-commerce with an appropriate revenue collecting structure built upon a foundation of fairness and equity to Main Street merchants.,2015-03-17 19:11:07.061858,2015-03-17 19:11:07.061858,Extensions,INTERNET NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2000,2000-05-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-11/html/CREC-2000-05-11-pt1-PgE720-2.htm,58,0,146,E720,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

Over 65 percent of Americans own a home, as do approximately 80 percent of Americans over the age of 50. This represents real progress. In 1940, fully 56 percent of Americans were renters. Clearly, America has come a long way. People buy homes for different reasons. A home can be a place of safety to raise a family, the potential of financial security, a sense of community. All around Missouri, and across this great nation, couples of all ages agree that buying a home is among the essential steps a family takes to ensure stability and prosperity in their lives.While homes are a worthwhile investment, they also are expensive. Real estate experts recommend that families buy homes valued at over three times their annual income--a sum far greater than what families could pay back in a year, or two, or even five. So, most Americans take out a mortgage. Once this burden of debt is behind them, they are free to dream new dreams --pay for their children's or grandchildren's education, travel, or make other investments.Homeownership is an important factor in promoting economic security and stability for American families. The level of homeownership among foreign-born naturalized citizens who have been in the United States for at least six years is the same as the level of homeownership of the Nation as a whole. When families such as these, who are new to our shores, prosper, we as a nation prosper.This resolution expresses the Senate's concern for improving homeownership in America. The resolution commends the nonprofit housing organization, Habitat for Humanity, and supports their commitment to partner with the United States Senate to strengthen neighborhoods and communities by building simple and affordable homes with low-income buyers. I thank Senator Brownback for offering this resolution and endorse its passage.,2015-03-17 19:11:07.212972,2015-03-17 19:11:07.212972,Senate,S.

2752,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of an outstanding group called the Hunger Project. The Hunger Project is a strategic organization and worldwide endeavor focused on ending hunger throughout the world. The Hunger Project strives for a more permanent, wide reaching solution to assure that all of us, including the citizens of underdeveloped societies in Africa, Asia and Latin America will one day know a world without hunger. Each region, country, city and village that suffers from hunger is unique. It is this simple truth that guides the work of the Hunger Project. Instead of relying upon solutions that have been successful in other places, each situation is approached as a new initiative and a plan is designed specifically with the particular area in mind. Through the mobilization of both the grassroots and the local leadership, effective, specialized plans are devised and implemented. The Hunger Project stresses self-reliance and enablement; when people are given the right tools, they can create societal structures that will not only end their hunger, but also prevent it from ever happening again.The key component of the Hunger Project's strategy is the empowerment of women. The unique position of women in society allow them to be the most effective agents of change in the battle against hunger. The responsibilities of nutrition, family planning, education and others typically fall to women, yet women are traditionally shut out of their society's development and decision making process in developing nations. The Hunger Project mobilizes women to fight for the ability to take control over their own lives and the future of their families.This Saturday, the twenty-third of September, the Hunger Project is launching a new crusade against hunger targeted at South Asia. According to the Hunger Project's President, Joan Holmes, studies show South Asia suffers from the highest levels of childhood malnutrition in the world as a direct result of the oppression of women in this area. However, new laws in both Bangladesh and India allow women to serve in their local governments. The Hunger Project is utilizing this new opportunity to help women in those nations organize, mobilize and exercise these new rights to make hunger in their communities a memory.Mr. Speaker, the mission and work of the Hunger Project are both admirable and vital. The dedication and commitment of individuals such as Karen Herman and other supporters of the Hunger Project are making the end of global hunger a goal within our reach. I salute their noble undertaking and look forward to working in partnership to assure that one day their vision of a world without hunger is realized.,2015-03-17 19:11:07.468154,2015-03-17 19:11:07.468154,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO THE HUNGER PROJECT,2000-09-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-21/html/CREC-2000-09-21-pt1-PgE1553-3.htm,113,0,146,E1553-E1554,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2753,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened by the loss of Henry Gonzalez. Henry was a good colleague, a good friend, and a real champion of the poor and all underprivileged Americans.In many ways, Henry was a trailblazer. The first Mexican-American from Texas to serve in the House, Henry always fought hard for his constituents in San Antonio. He was in the House for 37 years. His extraordinary length of service was matched only by his commitment to fairness and equality for every American, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity.Henry was one of the early leaders of the modern civil rights movement. In 1953, one year before the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, Henry was a member of the San Antonio City Council, and he helped pass a measure of desegregate city facilities. In 1956, three years later, Henry won election to the state Senate, and become the first Mexican-American in that body in over 100 years. By the way, he won that race by 309 votes--after three recounts, and it was a good thing that he won.Because he continued the good fight. In 1957, Henry spent 22 hours filibustering bills that supported segregation.Henry brought that same spirit to our Congress.In 1961, he was sworn-in to the House, and as he raised his right hand, left hand, he clutched a bill to end poll taxes, which discriminated against the poor and minorities. And this bill ultimately found its way into the 1965 Voting Rights Act. As a Member of Congress, Henry fought for low-cost housing so people would have a roof over their heads. And he became a real force in our body for the principle of equal opportunity.Henry was also one of the greatest Chairman of the House Banking Committee. He helped repair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and he helped steer the country through the savings and loan crisis.Deeply committed to his constituents and to his Caucus, Henry was a terrific ally who did so much for Democrats because of what it meant for the American people.Henry's passing leaves us with a void that can't be filled. But we will never forget his extraordinary dedication and service to this Congress and the country. His career is an inspiration to all of us, and humbly, we will work as hard as possible to fulfill his vision for all Americans.,2015-03-17 19:11:07.624265,2015-03-17 19:11:07.624265,House,TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HONORABLE HENRY B.

2754,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,If the gentleman will yield, I think that is exactly right. I think what happens is, if you do have sunset provisions, every agency not only is aware that it is going to have to come up for review, but every assignment it is given is going to have to come up for review, and that just does not happen now.We have lots of programs on the books that are not funded, are underfunded, or just out there waiting for that moment when they can come back in and grab some more money. Nobody ever challenges those things. I think that one of the great reviews we could do would be to do that.I think one of our freshman colleagues, the gentleman from Texas (Kevin Brady) has legislation he is working on that would really put sunset provisions in as an automatic part of any new program that goes into effect, any new agency that goes into effect. Then of course we ought to go back and attach those same provisions to old agencies.I think what happens in Colorado and other States that have this is the departments themselves pretty quickly come back to the legislature and say, when they see something that is going to be a problem for them, when it comes time to defend it, when it comes time for them to be reauthorized, they say in advance, you know, we think this is really not working out like we thought it would. We think you ought to eliminate this, because we do not want to come back 2 years from now and explain why we have not been able to make it work. I think that is one of the things we could do to begin to get this government under control.Also the other thing that has been mentioned so often tonight that we have taken great advantage of over the last 3 years has been the States themselves. How many times tonight in our discussion have we talked about, whether it is welfare programs or education programs, how much benefit we are getting by letting the 50 States be 50 laboratories for change?There are great results happening in State after State after State where we have allowed them leeway in areas like welfare that they have not had before. The Governor of Wisconsin just the other day, as was pointed out, wrote the last welfare check. There are not going to be any more of those checks issued in that State. It has made a dramatic difference in the way they approach this problem.,2015-03-17 19:11:07.856429,2015-03-17 19:11:07.856429,House,EXPLAINING THE ATTITUDES, CONCERNS, AND BELIEFS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS,1998-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-04/html/CREC-1998-03-04-pt1-PgH841-2.htm,20,28,144,H841-H848,B000575,mr. blunt
2755,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Henry Clever, Jr., who will be retiring from private practice on April 30, 1998. I hope you will join me in honoring his fine career and in wishing him a happy and healthy retirement.He and his wife, Roseann, have been married since June of 1956, and they have eleven children and 21 grandchildren. Not only has he distinguished himself with an impressive career in pediatric medicine, he has been a leader in his community for well over thirty years.Dr. Clever graduated from the University of Missouri Medical School in 1960, and started his private practice in St. Charles, Missouri, in 1963. He was the second pediatrician to open an office in St. Charles County. Since that time, he has been actively involved with numerous professional and community organizations dedicated to serving the residents of St. Charles County. Among these organizations are: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Missouri State Medical Association, the St. Louis Pediatric Society, the St. Charles County Association for Retarded Citizens, the Handicapped Facilities Board, the Missouri Mental Health Commission, the Four County Mental Health Board, the Board of Directors for Duchesne Bank of St. Peters, the Advisory and Endowment Board for Duchesne High School, Youth In Need, the St. Charles County Board of Trustee's for Mental Health, the March of Dimes, and the United Services for the Handicapped.He has also distinguished himself with his service to the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Dr. Clever has served on numerous committees for the Archdiocese including being a past-president and member of the St. Louis Archdiocese's Board of Education. His service as the co-chair of the Archdiocese's Pro-Life Committee has been an inspiration to all of us in the St. Louis area who are fighting to protect the lives of the unborn.Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me in congratulating and thanking Dr. Clever for his service to his patients, his community, his faith, and his family. He is truly a great humanitarian, leader, and citizen.,2015-03-17 19:11:08.102597,2015-03-17 19:11:08.102597,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DR.

2756,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today we commemorate Earth Day--an important occasion that has raised our national consciousness about environmental protection. In celebration of this event, I would like to pay tribute to one of the most committed environmental groups in the United States today, St. Louis' Earth Angels.The Earth Angels are a very special group of young environmentalists who are dedicated champions of our natural world. A grassroots group, there are now 150 Earth Angels working to preserve and protect the natural environment in our city. Many of the children who become Earth Angels come from homes of limited resources and few privileges. And they are courageously committed to improving their lives by helping to improve the quality of life in our community.The Earth Angels have adopted a noble mission. They are working to preserve the natural life of our planet. These children have worked thousands of hours recycling garbage, planting trees and raising funds to help protect the environment. They created and recently expanded a Model Prairie Garden at the Delmar Landing Metrolink station and now are hard at work on their third butterfly garden established on a vacant inner city lot.Over the years, the Earth Angels have received many national awards for their environmental achievements. Today the Earth Angels are receiving a ``Renew America Award'' from the National Awards Council for Environmental Sustainability (NACES), a coalition of 60 national environmental, nonprofit, government and business organizations including the National Audubon Society, Sierra Club, AT&amp;T, National Geographic and the Smithsonian Institution. Later this month, the Earth Angels will receive the National Arbor Day Foundation's Annual Award for 1998 in the category of Environmental Education. And recently St. Louis' Earth Angels received a Giraffe award from the Giraffe Foundation of Washington State--an honor given to those who have ``stuck their necks out'' for the common good.The Earth Angels are truly among the finest citizens in the city of St. Louis. These children are wise beyond their years and are sure to become tomorrow's leaders. The Earth Angels have the highest respect for the living world. They observe Earth Day every day. The Earth Angels are hard-working achievers who have made many invaluable contributions to the St. Louis community--I am proud to salute these outstanding young people.,2015-03-17 19:11:08.345771,2015-03-17 19:11:08.345771,Extensions,SALUTE TO EARTH ANGELS,1998-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-22/html/CREC-1998-04-22-pt1-PgE627.htm,45,0,144,E627,C000488,mr. clay
2757,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, every year Ebony magazine pays tribute to thirty leaders ages thirty and younger who are working for the betterment of their communities. They all represent the caliber of talent that is being groomed to move to the fore front of society and lead the United States of America into the 21st century. This year Metro East Family Church of East St. Louis, Illinois will be honoring the ``30 Young Leaders of the Future,'' featured in the December 1997 issue of Ebony Magazine. It is a great honor to congratulate each of Ebony magazine's selection of young leaders of the future, but especially the two from my home State of Missouri.Reverend Eric Mason, 25, is the pastor of Administration at the Metro East Family Church. Formerly, he was a case manager at the Nebraska Health and Human Services Department, then an assistant pastor and education director at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church and was appointed by the Governor of Nebraska to the Affirmative Action Commission as chaplain. He served as the Chair of the Omaha Police Department, on the Legal Redress Committee, was a member of Omaha NAACP, and the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. Reverend Mason personifies everything positive in the St. Louis community and I am excited to learn of his influential leadership.Faustenia Morrow, 25, is the development administrator for Team Sweep, a youth-at-risk program run by the City of St. Louis. She also is President of Young Organized Political Action Committee and fundraising chairperson of Metropolis St. Louis, an organization with the goal of attracting and retaining professionals in St. Louis. In addition, Ms. Morrow is assistant campaign advisor for Missouri State Representative Betty Thompson, founding member of the Sisters of High Tea, an organization of professional women and a member of the Professional Organization of Women. Her continuing commitment to the St. Louis community is a positive example for all and I am extremely pleased to have her as a role model for others.Dedication to one's community has become an increasingly rare quality in our society. However, Ebony's selection of young leaders has shown that the most effective approach to enriching a community is to give back rather than to take. Their unselfish commitment has set a precedence for the generations before and after them to follow and implement. I salute the contributions made by these leaders, and join the Metro East Family Church of East St. Louis in paying tribute to the ``30 Young Leaders of the Future.'' ,2015-03-17 19:11:08.501910,2015-03-17 19:11:08.501910,Senate,TRIBUTE TO REVEREND ERIC MASON AND FAUSTENIA MORROW,1998-05-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-22/html/CREC-1998-05-22-pt1-PgS5472-3.htm,67,0,144,S5472,B000611,mr. bond
2758,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Our Tax Code has and still operates in some instances to allow combining, by having a joint return, combined return, to have a lower tax for married people, and that really results from the conscious decision we make to recognize the value to our culture of a stay-at-home spouse. It focuses attention on the children and says we ought to give some benefit taxwise for doing that. And you do that by allowing the spouse who works to attribute some income to the stay-at-home spouse.I don't think there are very many of us who are married who, when one or the other has had to stay at home, doesn't realize that the one who focuses on the homeplace and undertakes that responsibility is really responsible for income and is responsible for the benefit of the family.I believe that the ability to split the income so that you get to the lowest tax bracket is something that should be provided to everybody in marriage. I wouldn't call it a bonus as if it were giving something out. It is a recognition of the value of the spouse who stays at home and the contribution that spouse makes, not only to the marriage and to the family but the contribution they make to the country.Most of the data we are seeing now about children--and I am sure my friend from Kansas agrees with this data and has witnessed the articles and all the expounding--indicate that when one of the spouses can stay at home and spend a lot of time with the children, it is a big investment in the children and it results in children having lower incidences of bad health and lower incidences of school failure, dropout, lower incidences of juvenile delinquency and all. So that kind of attention from the family really is a social benefit to the entire culture, because if there are fewer dropouts, it means that your education system works better; if there is better health, it means the cost of the benefits of the health providers are lower; and if there is lower juvenile delinquency, it certainly means we benefit.,2015-03-17 19:11:08.773081,2015-03-17 19:11:08.773081,Senate,ELIMINATION OF THE MARRIAGE PENALTY,1998-07-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-21/html/CREC-1998-07-21-pt1-PgS8597.htm,98,5,144,S8597-S8600,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2759,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan stood in this Chamber nearly a decade ago and attacked the Congress for sending him a massive last-minute appropriation bill. Well, here we go again.This bill is 4,000 pages long and weighs over 40 pounds. And at that time Ronald Reagan said, Congress should not send another one of these and, if you do, he said, I will not sign it.Well, here they go again. This bill is a symbol of the wasted time and misguided priorities of a Republican Congress whose leadership consumed our agenda with investigations instead of legislation. Thanks to the Republican leadership, we have worked the fewest days and passed the fewest bills in decades. We did not even pass a budget resolution in this House of Representatives, the first time since the Budget Act passed 24 years ago.For the last year Republicans in Congress have tried to focus the debate on anything except what is really significant to our future. They have had far more enthusiasm for subpoenas than for schools, and they would rather talk about the FBI than the IMF.We were able to convince a reluctant and unwilling Republican majority to include funding for 100,000 new teachers in this bill, teachers that will help reduce class size and improve the quality of our children's education. While Democrats may not be satisfied with what was not included in this bill today, we will come back and fight again and again for a Patients' Bill of Rights, anti-teen smoking initiatives and an increase in the minimum wage. And a Democratic majority will hopefully enact the reforms to guarantee the future of Social Security and save the surplus for Social Security, which the Republican majority tried to spend before it could be saved, to save that program.Ronald Reagan was right. It was a bad way to do business in 1988, and it is a bad way to do business in 1998.Mr. Speaker, it is time for a change. It is time for a Congress that works full time to help meet the challenges of our future instead of skipping town with unfilled promises and unmet priorities, and one that fulfills its constitutional role to produce a budget in a manner befitting of us all.If we want to change the agenda, it should be very clear. We have to change the leadership of this Congress. I believe the American people will do that, and I hope for the sake of the people they do.,2015-03-17 19:11:09.006241,2015-03-17 19:11:09.006241,House,WAIVING POINTS OF ORDER AGAINST CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4328, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999,1998-10-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-20/html/CREC-1998-10-20-pt1-PgH11583-2.htm,150,33,144,H11583-H11591,G000132,mr. gephardt
2760,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senator DeWine's effort to establish a pediatric research initiative within the Office of the Director at the National Institutes of Health [NIH].To achieve real progress in improving the health of our Nation's most vulnerable and valuable resource--our children--we must strengthen public investments in pediatric research; enhance Federal coordination among the NIH Institutes to ensure quality multi-disciplinary research in areas of scientific progress; develop new incentives for investment in pediatric clinical trials; support new ways to treat children with special conditions; and develop information to promote safer and more effective use of prescription drugs for children.The opportunity for scientific progress in combating and preventing illnesses and diseases affecting children has never been greater. To assist the NIH in strengthening its pediatric research efforts, I, along with other members of the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, successfully secured $5 million for the NIH Office of the Director to begin this new pediatric research initiative last year.Senator DeWine's legislation builds upon that down payment, and I look forward to working with other Members of the Senate in ensuring passage of this effort.Although health care spending for children is only a fraction of total health care spending, we must not turn our backs on the health care needs of our children. Pediatric research offers potential savings in health care costs as well as substantial benefits to the well-being of children for a lifetime. Moreover, pediatric research contributes to new insights and discoveries in preventing and treating illnesses and diseases among our country's adult population.

2761,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today in my hometown of Mexico, MO, a very dear lifelong friend, Tim Hagan, will be buried. Lowell Lambert ``Tim'' Hagan, III, owner of Hagan Clothing Co., died Sunday after a long battle with cancer, and will be sadly missed by his family and all of us who were privileged to be counted among his friends.Tim was a tremendous businessman and community leader. Born and raised in Mexico, MO, Tim developed a lifelong reputation as ``doer''. He successfully ran the family clothing business, and was involved in numerous community organizations, including the Rotary Club, the Mexico Chamber of Commerce, and the Mexico Country Club. Out of compassion for those less fortunate, he was the former president of the Audrain County Cerebral Palsy Society, and for 6 years was chairman of the Missouri National Multiple Sclerosis Hope Chest Campaign.Because of his understanding of the daily challenges small business owners face, Tim was chosen to be part of the Missouri delegation for the White House Conference on Small Business in 1995. That conference was one of the most successful in history, in that some of the ideas generated by Tim and others to create small business jobs and opportunities have been acted on by Congress and many others are now being discussed.Tim also felt that the education of our children and youth was particularly important to securing a good future, and was instrumental in bringing the Technical College to Mexico. That contribution will benefit the youth of Audrain County for years to come. His presence and spirit in the community will also continue to be felt for many years in that his own son, John, will continue to run the fourth generation family business.Tim shared with his friends a love of his Irish ancestry, though his love was more frequently and forcefully expressed as a lifelong Democrat. Even in the last days of his illness, he and I engaged in many spirited, but good natured political debates.Our culture is quick to glorify the here and now, the ``flash in the pan'' celebrities, the ``cause'' of the day. By that measure, Tim Hagan stood apart. While he was known in the community as a ``feisty Irishman'' with unfailing energy, he was also a builder. He spent his entire life making life better for his family, his employees, his church, and his community. His love for others knew no racial or social boundaries. We will miss him terribly.I ask unanimous consent that an editorial by Joe A.

2762,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, Dr. Betty Shabazz was a remarkable woman. Her intrepid spirit and tireless efforts on behalf of her family and people of color made her a role model around the world. People from many races and nations drew strength from the courage she showed in the face of adversity.I had the privilege of knowing Betty as a friend and colleague in the struggle for justice. Like many African-American mothers, she was a fighter and a survivor. After her husband's death, she found strength from within to overcome the tragedy and went on to raise six daughters while pursuing a professional career and serving the community. She set high goals for herself and worked diligently to achieve them.After Malcolm X's death, Betty went back to school and earned three degrees, including a doctorate in education. She went on to teach at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, NY, and served as the school's director of communications and public relations. She also hosted a talk show on one of New York's major radio stations.As a civil rights leader, Betty often spoke out against race and gender discrimination and on issues of importance to families around the world. She was actively involved in various political and social action groups including the NAACP, the National Political Congress of Black Women, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and the Links.Like many African-Americans, Betty was part of an extended family. At the time of her death, she was helping to raise her grandson, Malcolm Shabazz. As she had helped his mother and aunts to do, Betty attempted to help young Malcolm to thrive despite his father's absence. Unfortunately, her time with him was cut short by her untimely death.Few of us have suffered the tragic loss that Betty Shabazz suffered when she lost her husband to an assassin's bullet. However, most of us know all too well the racism that killed him. The racial hatred that caused terror to the family that Betty and her daughters knew continues to destroy African-American families. It continues to deny blacks equal access to economic and employment opportunities, equal justice under the law, and equal representation in legislative bodies.Betty Shabazz lived an honorable and exemplary life. She fought against racism and injustice for most of her life. Even when she could have retreated from the rest of the world without blame, she continued to fight. She fought harder for herself, her family, and her community. Her life was a tribute to all families, but to African-American families in particular.,2015-03-17 19:11:09.873864,2015-03-17 19:11:09.873864,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DR.

I again appreciate my colleagues for joining me and participating in this special order.I think, Mr. Speaker, to those naysayers that have picked apart these past weeks' aspects of what we have done here, we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Clearly we are not here to rest on past accomplishments. We have a tremendous amount of work yet to do, and we have just touched the surface.Mr. Thune talked about trying to crack down on fraud and abuse in many of these programs. I know one of the things on the agenda we will be focusing on, Mr. Pappas mentioned the Committee on Ways and Means. We are going to be focusing on how to restructure possibly the Internal Revenue Service.Everybody talks about trying to simplify the Tax Code. We need to continue to have those discussions, beyond just having Presidential candidates come forward and say this is what we ought to do. I think this is a dialog we have to get the American people on board with us, whether they favor just the Tax Code that we have and simplifying that, or whether they favor a flat income tax or a national consumption tax, a sales tax or the like.But our efforts to restructure the IRS, whether it is the highway bill, the infrastructure, investing in roads and bridges that are so needed across the country, or as another freshman Member, we are talking about education. This is the time everybody is heading back to school or colleges and universities. The fact is we have to get more money than is presently appropriated back into the classrooms, so teachers are not having to dig in their own pockets and purchase school supplies to educate the kids that are entrusted to them.There are so many things we have yet to do. But I think in our quest for progress, we have to continue to stay on the path. I think we are committed to doing that, certainly as this freshman class is on this side and many on the other side, of trying to work with politics of cooperation, rather than politics of confrontation.,2015-03-17 19:11:10.119031,2015-03-17 19:11:10.119031,House,LISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,1997-09-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-03/html/CREC-1997-09-03-pt1-PgH6765-2.htm,114,20,143,H6765-H6771,H000948,mr. hulshof
2764,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say a special word in tribute to David H. Goldstein, who has served as executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Bureau/American Jewish Committee of Greater Kansas City since 1972. Goldstein, an expert in community relations, is celebrating his 25th anniversary as executive director.A native of Cleveland, OH, Goldstein began his career in public relations by earning a bachelor's degree in sociology from Case Western Reserve University and a master's degree in education from Butler University. After college, Goldstein went to work for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New England. He then took a post at the Jewish Community Relation Council in Indianapolis. While at that job, Goldstein designed one of the earliest Head Start programs. Head Start is a program designed to prepare underprivileged children for school, and Goldstein became its first director in Indianapolis. Later, Goldstein went on to direct a Head Start program in Washington, DC, and then to work in fair housing at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development before coming to Kansas City to head the JCRB.While at his post in Kansas City, Goldstein has helped coordinate a working relationship between the Jewish community and the community at large. Other major areas of Goldstein's involvement have centered around fostering good relations with the African-American community, fighting anti-Semitism, and working for freedom for Soviet Jewry.Goldstein is a member of the board of directors of the Kansas City chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He has served on the boards of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Urban League, and was cochairperson of the Kansas City, MO Human Rights Commission.Mr. Speaker, for 25 years David H. Goldstein has served the people of the Kansas City area with pride and honesty. I am certain that the Members of the House will join me in paying tribute to this great American.,2015-03-17 19:11:10.527350,2015-03-17 19:11:10.527350,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DAVID H.

2765,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues in the Congress to join me in paying tribute to Douglas K. Rush, a truly outstanding Naval officer and attorney from St. Louis, MO. After 29 years of exemplary active and reserve service in the U.S. Navy, Captain Rush is retiring from the military.Doug Rush, a veteran of the Vietnam war and Operation Desert Storm, began his military career in 1968 as a cadet in the U.S. Naval Academy. Following his graduation in 1972, Mr. Rush served in the U.S. Navy through the end of the Vietnam war until 1978. Following his active duty tenure, Mr. Rush joined the Navy Reserves, where he served for 13 years. In 1991, Operation Desert Storm summoned Mr. Rush's reserve unit to active duty, and once again, he was called to serve his country in a foreign war. At the conclusion of Operation Desert Storm, Mr. Rush returned to reserve duty, whereupon he retired in May of this year.Mr. Rush not only began an outstanding military career at the Naval Academy, but his education there laid the foundation for an outstanding civilian career. Earning a bachelor of science in military and political science from Annapolis in 1972, he went on to study at St. Louis University School of Law. In 1981, Mr. Rush graduated cum laude, earning a juris doctor degree. Mr. Rush worked at the Armstrong, Teasdale, Schiafly, and Davis firm first as a law student, then as an associate upon his graduation. He eventually became a partner and the assistant chairman of the Transportation Law Department. He remained with this firm until 1993, when he joined the Law Offices of C. Marshall Friedman. As a member of this firm, Mr. Rush specializes in trial cases on behalf of injured railroad workers.Louis as a civic leader. He served for approximately 6 years on the St. Louis School Board, and was elected president of that organization. As a member of the school board, he lobbied for desegregation programs, and concentrated on efforts to raise achievement levels in the St. Louis public schools. Mr. Rush has received awards for his civic achievements, including the Outstanding Civic Leader Award, given by the St. Louis Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Government Achievement Award, given by the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council. Doug also has served as a trustee of the city of St. Louis Mental Health Board since 1992.Today, we honor his service to this country, and we also honor Douglas Rush for his outstanding civilian achievements in the field of law and the community of St. Louis, MO. I wish him well in the days ahead.,2015-03-17 19:11:10.827541,2015-03-17 19:11:10.827541,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS K.

2766,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Life-Choices Pregnancy Center, which has served the women of Joplin, MO since its inception in 1990. To date, over 4,000 women have received services from the center in the form of pregnancy testing, counseling for those considering an abortion, and support for those who have already had an abortion. The center also manages two programs that make a difference in the lives of many Joplin residents: Mom Care, is designed to help mothers deal with their parenting responsibilities, and the Virtuous Reality program provides valuable information to teens and parents about making responsible and healthy choices in their lives. As evidence of the good work of the Life-Choices Pregnancy Center, at least 160 babies who would have been aborted are alive and well today because of their counseling and support.On October 7, the center will dedicate its new facility which will enable it to serve more women in a number of new ways. The center will immediately begin to offer ultrasound imaging, physical exams, and other forms of pre-natal care for at-risk women. In the near future, they also plan to add testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pre and post adoption counseling, abstinence education, and a 24 hour telephone help line to better serve the women of southwest Missouri.Life constantly presents us with choices, and there are consequences to the choices that we make. A woman faced with an unplanned pregnancy has few options, and often feels that she has no where to turn. I am grateful that the women of Joplin can turn to the Life-Choices Pregnancy Center because there they can find a friend who has the patience to listen and the experience to understand and give advice that many would not be able to give. And, whatever her decision might be, I know that the center will provider her with the love, support, and counseling that she will need to make it through such a difficult time.In closing, I remember the words of Mother Theresa. Speaking at a National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, she asked ``How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we must persuade her with love and remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even his life to love us.'' I thank everyone who made the choice to give of their time and love for the benefit of others at the Life-Choices Pregnancy Center.,2015-03-17 19:11:11.082722,2015-03-17 19:11:11.082722,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE-CHOICES PREGNANCY CENTER,1997-10-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-10-02/html/CREC-1997-10-02-pt1-PgE1905-2.htm,135,0,143,E1905,B000575,mr. blunt
2767,MO,Melton,Hancock,R,Mr. Speaker, on May 27, 1947, Central High School, Springfield, MO, graduated 563 students. On June 13 and 14, 1997, the class of 1947 will commemorate the 50th anniversary of this momentous and historical occasion. Rarely does a Member of the United States Congress have the opportunity to acknowledge the 50th anniversary of his own high school graduating class in the Congressional Record. Even I cannot do it because I will no longer be a Member of the U.S. Congress on the actual date next year.Many of our class only remain in our memories. This pleasant memory of a group of 563, most of whom went on to become outstanding citizens and contributors to society, is a tribute to the educational system existing 50 years ago.Mr. Speaker, I am going to take this opportunity for a few very brief remarks about the changes in our educational system in the past 50 years.This class of 1947 attended school when sleeping or chewing gum in class and running in the halls were heinous crimes. The class of 1947 had student hall monitors instead of armed police officers and entrance metal detectors. Discipline was demanded and I do not know of any of the 563 students even confronting the school administration with their attorney concerning their Rights. Attention deficiency syndrome was treated with a failing grade. Now we give the parents a check and treat the kids with psychological evaluation to find out why they do not like their parents or themselves.No, this was not a perfect time. Smoking tobacco and some alcohol use existed. However, marijuana and cocaine was not part of our vocabulary. This was when local school boards made decisions rather than the bureaucrats in the State and Federal Departments of Stupidity. The National Education Association was in its infancy. Too bad it survived and grew into the monster it now is.Every one of us who graduated in 1947 should be thankful for having lived in the fastest growing economy the world has ever seen, in the greatest country ever envisioned by mankind.If I could have one wish for future generations, it would be for our educational system to again teach that freedom is not free, it always requires sacrifice and that civil rights never should supersede our God given inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.On our 50th anniversary it is time to reflect and also to look foreword. Change is inevitable. Let us pray that the principles we were taught will some day again be in vogue.I am looking foreword to June 13-14, 1997, in Springfield, MO, to seeing the senior high school class of 1947.,2015-03-17 19:11:11.338905,2015-03-17 19:11:11.338905,House,CHANGES IN AMERICA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM,1996-05-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-07/html/CREC-1996-05-07-pt1-PgH4436.htm,62,1,142,H4436,H000151,mr. hancock
2768,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, Members of theHouse, this is a sad day for me as a Member of this body having served here 20 years. You know, last year when the ethics complaints were being filed against the Speaker, I characterized what is happening to this House as there was a great cloud over this House and we needed to remove that cloud. That cloud has not been removed; in fact, it has gotten darker. It has done more to harm the image of the U.S. House of Representatives than any actions that have been taken on legislation.Even though their Contract With America would have cut Medicare, would have cut environmental protection, would have cut education, all to give tax cuts for the wealthy; that is bad enough. But what is going on today and has been going on with the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and its coverup of what the Speaker of theHouse has done is shameful beyond any comprehension.It is a sad day when Members of theHouse cannot even get a copy of the report that the special counsel has filed with the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct on just one of several, seven, complaints that have been filed against the Speaker. Only on one. They have not done anything on the others.What is the gentlewoman from Connecticut doing? Well, she met with the floor leader the other day. She has had press conferences in Connecticut. But she will not tell us anything. In fact they met just yesterday. Why did they not release the report?I am sure not one of the five Republican Members of that Committee on Standards of Official Conduct will ever vote to release that report. All they have to do is vote to release it and it comes out. You and the public, Members of theHouse, the media, everybody, will know what is in that report.

2769,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I am joining with 26 of my colleagues to introduce legislation to curb the re-emergence of sweatshops in the domestic garment industry. This legislation is identical to a bill I introduced in the last Congress, H.R. 23.Sweatshops have returned to the apparel industry in the United States in numbers and forms reminiscent of the turn of the century. A decade and a half ago, the General Accounting Office (GAO) documented the re-emergence of sweatshops. The GAO has identified sweatshop activity across the country, from California to New York and from Chicago to Texas and Florida. Despite significant and commendable enforcement efforts by the Department of Labor under the Clinton Administration, sweatshops continue to be a serious problem, particularly within the garment industry. Even my Republican colleagues on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the Gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Goodling, and the Gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Hoekstra, have noted the re-emergence of sweatshops.The re-emergence of sweatshops has impoverished workers and their families and has driven reputable contractors out of otherwise profitable businesses. It represents a problem that cannot and should not be tolerated.The ``Stop Sweatshops Act'' establishes joint liability on the part of manufacturers in the garment industry who contract with sweatshop operators for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This legislation strengthens the ability of the Department of Labor to enforce the law and improves the ability of garment workers to obtain redress where violations occur. As importantly, by encouraging manufacturers in the garment industry to deal with reputable contractors, this legislation acts to balance market pressures that have encouraged the re-emergence of sweatshops.One hundred of my colleagues joined me last Congress as cosponsors of this legislation. I urge those of my colleagues who have supported this legislation in the past to do so again. And, I urge those who have not previously cosponsored this legislation to do so now. We cannot continue to allow unscrupulous employers to drive responsible employers out of business. Nor should we continue to tolerate working conditions that undermine rather than promote the well being of workers. As we near the end of the 20th Century, we must eliminate this vestige of 19th Century exploitation.,2015-03-17 19:11:12.113456,2015-03-17 19:11:12.113456,Extensions,STOP SWEATSHOPS--NOW,1999-01-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-01-07/html/CREC-1999-01-07-pt1-PgE47-5.htm,2,0,145,E47-E48,C000488,mr. clay
2770,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that Governor Mel Carnahan of Missouri is one of five public leaders nationwide to receive an Americans for the Arts' Government Leadership in the Arts award.Governor Carnahan received the 1999 Americans for the Arts and The United States Conference of Mayors Award for State Arts Leadership. Governor Carnahan was recognized for his outstanding leadership in forging overwhelming bipartisan support of the arts, resulting in unprecedented cultural policy within the state of Missouri. He spearheaded and signed into law a provision designating 100 percent of an existing tax on non-resident athletes and entertainers to build a $100 million state Cultural Trust over the next ten years. A portion of this designated revenue stream will also provide annual state budget increases for the arts. A number of other exemplary initiatives also characterize Governor Carnahan's leadership in the arts. Since taking office in 1993, Governor Carnahan steadily increased the annual appropriations for the arts in the state, ranking Missouri seventh nationally in per capita state funding for the arts. He established the Missouri Fine arts Academy at Springfield, MO, providing 200 high school students each year the opportunity to participate in a three-week residence program to sharpen their artistic talents. His efforts also led to the statewide public school adoption of arts education as a part of their core curriculum.Nominated by the Missouri Arts Council and Missouri Citizens for the Arts, Governor Carnahan was honored at the Mayor's Arts Gala at Washington, D.C., on January 28, 1999. The event was held in conjunction with the Conference of Mayor's Annual Meeting and the Urban Arts Foundation meeting, a gathering of more than 700 mayors and arts leaders from across the nation.Governor Carnahan shares this honor with many key national figures including, Senator Edward Kennedy, of Massachusetts; Representative Michael Castle, of Delaware, Mayor Joseph Riley, of Charleston, S.C.; and Jane Alexander, former NEA Chairperson.Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Governor Carnahan, and join the Americans for the Arts in commending his good work.,2015-03-17 19:11:12.279574,2015-03-17 19:11:12.279574,Extensions,CONGRATULATIONS TO GOVERNOR MEL CARNAHAN OF MISSOURI,1999-02-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-02-04/html/CREC-1999-02-04-pt1-PgE143-2.htm,20,0,145,E143,S000465,mr. skelton

Stahr, Jr., governor emeritus of the Sigma Chi Foundation, scholar, war veteran, attorney, and public servant, passed away on November 11 after a battle with cancer. He was 82.Stahr earned 4 years of straight A's as an undergraduate at the University of Kentucky (UK), was named a Rhodes Scholar, then studied at Oxford University for three years. He returned to the United States briefly before serving in the U.S. Army infantry in North Africa, India, and China during World War II. After serving in the Army, he practiced law for eight years and served as Grand Praetor for the Eastern province.After serving as dean of the UK law school and university provost, Stahr was appointed as special assistant to the Secretary of the Army during the Korean war, and in 1956-57, he was executive director of President Eisenhower's committee on education beyond high school.Stahr became vice chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh in early 1957, and in August 1958 he was named president of West Virginia University. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed him Secretary of the Army, a post in which he served until the summer of 1962 when he resigned to become the 12th president of Indiana University.In 1968, the Audubon Society named Stahr its president, a position he maintained until 1979. After stepping down from the Audubon presidency, he served on several boards and committees, including those for the Acacia Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Committee on the Constitutional System, and the Washington Conservation Round Table, of which he also served as chairman. He also continued to practice law in Washington, DC.Stahr is survived by his wife of 52 years, Dorothy Howland Berkfield Stahr, three children and two grandchildren.Mr. Speaker, Elvis J.

2772,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, during our appearance before the Committee on Rules yesterday, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu) and I asked that our class size reduction amendment be made in order. Unfortunately, the committee failed to do so.This restrictive rule that was reported now makes it necessary to defeat the previous question in order for our class size reduction amendment to even be considered.Our amendment would establish a 6-year authorization for the Clinton-Clay-Wu class size reduction initiative. This would build on the 1-year, $1.2 billion down payment on the initiative that was included in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act. That funding, however, will only support the hiring of 30,000 teachers for the 1999-2000 school year.Now it is time, Mr. Speaker, to lock in the remainder of the funding so that school districts across America can count on receiving the full complement of 100,000 teachers needed to achieve the initiatives goal.Mr. Speaker, some critics, without evidence or documentation, continue to boisterously shout that the 30,000 teachers will be unqualified to teach. This is a sad commentary for those who prefer to build prisons than to build schools and to hire guards than to hire teachers.Mr. Speaker, the goal of the Clinton-Clay-Wu class size reduction initiative is to help schools improve student achievement by adding additional highly qualified teachers to the work force to ensure that class size is reduced to not more than 18 children per class in the early grades.Mr. Speaker, this will ensure that every child receives a teacher's personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning, and is prepared to read independently by the end of the third grade.Ample research demonstrates that reducing class size boosts student achievement considerably. The Department the Education data shows that students in smaller classes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee outperform their counterparts in larger classes. A study in Tennessee's project STAR found that students in smaller classes in grades K through 3 earn much higher scores on basic skill tests.Based on this solid record of achievement, the Clinton-Clay-Wu class size reduction initiative should be expanded by granting it a full 7-year authorization to ensure class size reduction in grades K through 3 to an average of just 18 students.Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members to support this effort, to defeat the previous question, and allow a vote on the Clinton-Clay-Wu class size reduction amendment.,2015-03-17 19:11:12.590795,2015-03-17 19:11:12.590795,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 800, EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-10/html/CREC-1999-03-10-pt1-PgH1081.htm,38,9,145,H1081-H1088,C000488,mr. clay
2773,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute today to one of our Nation's heroes. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks has been called the Mother of the modern civil rights movement. She was born in Alabama in 1913 and grew up in a racially segregated world. Rosa was forced to endure the horrors of white hooded racists who burned crosses and terrorized blacks. She was part of a generation of black children who were denied access to a public education and denied their basic human rights as equal citizens under law. But Rosa Parks was among those who championed the cause of right over might, for the sake of black Americans and all Americans. She overcame her fears of the segregated society in which she lived and faced down the racial hatred that clouded her childhood.December 1, 1955, marked a turning point in the life of Rosa Parks. After a hard day of work, she claimed a seat on a Montgomery city bus and then she refused to give it up to a white male. Her actions inspired the Montgomery bus boycott that led to the Supreme Court ruling overturning the laws of Alabama. This simple act of courage changed her life forever. Her decision is now remembered as the spark that lit the path of the march for civil rights. In 1955 Rosa Parks stayed in her seat and stood up to scores of unjust and racist laws. She has spent the rest of her life working and struggling for justice and equality for all.Mrs. Parks' peaceful defiance of racial segregation made her a legend in the history of this Nation. Today, children who understand little of the real horrors of racial segregation know the tale of Rosa Parts and how she helped to lead our nation to the end of this truly terrible chapter in our history.Today, Mrs. Parks is a legend who reminds us that though much has been accomplished since that cold December night in Montgomery AL, nearly 44 years ago, the struggle to end racism and inequality is far from over. I salute Rosa Parks for her innumerable contributions to our Nation--she is a woman whose story will inspire generations to come. I urge passage of H.R. 563, authorizing the President of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa Parks.,2015-03-17 19:11:12.745905,2015-03-17 19:11:12.745905,Extensions,AUTHORIZING AWARDING OF GOLD MEDAL TO ROSA PARKS,1999-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-21/html/CREC-1999-04-21-pt1-PgE726-2.htm,55,0,145,E726,C000488,mr. clay
2774,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I want to get back to the fundamental point, and there are about three of them. I will try to make these quickly: One, that the law does provide for differential treatment. If it didn't provide for differential treatment, we wouldn't have the law. As a matter of fact, part of it was in response to this Fourth Circuit opinion, and the Congress acted. In so providing, we created a big loophole for guns and firearms in the school.We basically provided a basis for differential treatment for people who are the subject of IEPs, these special education students, who might be--I forget what the Senator from Alabama said--emotionally distressed, or troubled, or severely emotionally distressed. They might be able to come to school and have different treatment if they carry a gun to school than if someone else does.The simple fact is that the Senator from Tennessee and I believe we ought to give authority to school principals to deal with such cases as forthrightly as they do with other cases. This is in light of the fact that when you get out, not in the Chamber of the Senate, not in the theory of the bureaucracy, but when you get out into local schools, the law operates to constrain those school officials to have students come back to school who have carried guns to school and pipe bombs to school. They have carried them in, and it is not in the best interest, according to school officials, to have the students back in, but they are back in.We simply want to liberate school principals and school officials to say to people who bring guns and pipe bombs, firearms, to school, you can't do that, you are out until we say you can come back, in the same way we say that under the Gun-Free Schools Act, which is the Federal Government's mandate, students are entitled to go to school in a place that is not full of guns and firearms.I thank the Senator from Vermont for according me this opportunity to make that simple statement, that we want to provide parity for students: No matter who you are, when you bring firearms and guns to school, we want the principal to be able to send you home.,2015-03-17 19:11:12.969063,2015-03-17 19:11:12.969063,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-19/html/CREC-1999-05-19-pt1-PgS5507-7.htm,73,462,145,S5507-S5583,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2775,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation being introduced by the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee--the senior Senator from Arizona. I strongly support the reforms to state vicarious liability laws contained in the ``Motor Vehicle Rental Fairness Act of 1999'' and urge my colleagues to support this important bill and move it swiftly towards enactment.I commend the chairman for taking the lead on this important legislation. His bill, of which I am proud to be an original co-sponsor, seeks to put a halt to an absurd aberration in our legal system. Under the vicarious liability laws of a very small number of states, companies that rent or lease motor vehicles are held strictly liable if their renters or lessees are negligent and cause an accident. The company does not have to be negligent in any way. The vehicle may operate perfectly and be maintained properly. These states simply hold the company liable because of their ownership of the vehicle.The only way for these companies to avoid this liability would be to stop renting or leasing these vehicles. This is not an acceptable resolution to this problem. The American justice system should be based on the general principle that a defendant should be held liable only for harm he or she could prevent--not merely because the defendant has a ``deep pocket.''Vicarious liability laws undermine competition in these states and have driven smaller rental and leasing companies out of business. In fact, vicarious liability acts as a tax on all rental and leasing companies--and their customers--nationwide because these companies must try to recover their losses from vicarious claims through rental rates nationwide.It is time to put a stop to this legal disconnect. Hold these companies liable if they are negligent. Hold them liable if they fail to properly maintain one of the vehicles they rent or lease. But do not hold them liable simply for being in business--for fulfilling the needs of our traveling constituents.Mr. President, I look forward to hearings on the Senator from Arizona's legislation at the earliest possible date and hope to move this legislation through this body as quickly as possible.

2776,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding me this time.I want to join with my colleagues in encouraging support of this bill. This bill really provides significant transition that is not readily there for foster kids who, by the time they reach 18, have, on many occasions, if not most occasions, faced more adversity than most of us face in a lifetime: the insecurity of the life as a foster child, the not knowing the situation with one's parents, the not knowing what may come next.In fact, statistics show that foster kids do have greater problems as adults with alcoholism, with homelessness, with crime, with poverty. This bill helps give that independent living transition the leg up that is needed.The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) just talked about the importance of continuation of health insurance. Many, many kids in our society have health insurance from 18 to 21, or maybe even 18 until 23 because they are continuing their education, and their parents are able to extend their coverage to them. That is not available to foster children. So foster children, during that time of transition, during that decision about further schooling, have to deal with this critical question of health care and insurance as well. This helps bridge part of that gap. This is a bill that really does address the needs of foster kids.This Congress needs to be committed to foster care. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority whip, is a foster parent. He and his wife have foster children. Others in this body have really been leaders in trying to extend to foster care and foster children the care that is missing in their life.This Congress can show we care today about these kids. We care about what happens to them as they make that transition often, and most often without the benefit of that parental involvement in their life, the transition to the work force, transition to adult responsibility, a transition to taking care of themselves. This bill helps make that happen.I urge my colleagues to support it.,2015-03-17 19:11:13.568490,2015-03-17 19:11:13.568490,House,FOSTER CARE INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 1999,1999-06-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-06-25/html/CREC-1999-06-25-pt1-PgH4957-4.htm,92,24,145,H4957-H4987,B000575,mr. blunt
2777,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of former Missouri Supreme Court Judge Robert T. Donnelly, 74, of Jefferson City, Missouri.Judge Donnelly was born Aug. 31, 1924, in Lebanon, Missouri, a son of Thomas J. and Sybil True Donnelly. He was married Nov. 16, 1946, in Little Rock, Arkansas, to Wanda Sue ``Susie'' Oates, who survives at the home.A graduate of Lebanon High School, he attended the University of Tulsa and Ohio State University. He graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia, receiving his law degree from the university in 1949. An Army veteran of World War II, he received the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.Judge Donnelly practiced law in Lebanon, Missouri, with Phil M. Donnelly and David Donnelly from 1952 to 1965. He was an assistant Attorney General of Missouri from 1957 to 1963.He was appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court by Governor Warren E. Hearnes in 1965, and served as chief justice from 1973 to 1975, and from 1981 to 1983. He was the first chief justice to address the General Assembly of Missouri on the State of the Judiciary in January Judge Donnelly was active in the community. He was a member and elder at First Presbyterian Church, a member of Lebanon Masonic Lodge, A.F. & A.M. and a 50-year member of the Missouri Bar. He served on the Lebanon Board of Education from 1959 to 1965; on the board of the School of Religion, Drury College, Springfield, from 1958 to 1963; and on the board of the Missouri School of Religion, Columbia, from 1971 to 1972.He was deputy chairman of the National Conference of Chief Justices in 1975. In 1998 he published ``A Whistle in the Night,'' his autobiography and memoir.Judge Robert T. Donnelly will be missed by all who had the privilege to know him. I know the Members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to his family: his wife, Susie; his two sons, Thomas and Brian; his sister, Helen; and his three grandchildren.,2015-03-17 19:11:13.734602,2015-03-17 19:11:13.734602,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF JUDGE ROBERT T.

2778,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my concerns about the funding levels in this bill for the National Endowment for the Arts. I am disappointed that this bill is substantially less than the President's budget request.While I am pleased that the bill requires the NEA to give priority in granting funds for educational projects, I am particularly disappointed that the bill does not include funds for a new program, Challenge America, which includes arts education, youth-at-risk programs, cultural heritage preservation, and community arts partnerships.As a former schoolteacher, I believe that a key solution to youth violence and a key component to youth development is access to the arts in schools. If we are serious about curtailing youth violence, it is imperative that adequate funding be provided to bring music and art to our children.If the Challenge America program is funded, state arts agencies would receive 40 percent of these funds, and at least 1,000 communities nationwide will benefit.Research has shown that arts programs can have a very positive effect on our youth, helping to increase academic achievement and decrease delinquent behavior.Children who are exposed to arts perform 30 percent better academically. High-risk elementary students who participated in an arts program for 1 year gained 8 percentile points on standardized language arts tests.The Smart Symphonies program initiated by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences provides free CDs of classical music for infants in response to findings that show, among other things, that early exposure to classical music increases a child's ability to learn math and science.In Missouri's fifth district, the Young Audiences Arts Partners Program integrates community arts resources into the curriculum of participating school districts, with a focus on not only teaching students to appreciate the arts, but also on talking about issues that the arts raise in healthy, nonjudgmental ways.Let us make a commitment to our children to provide them with the tools they need to be responsible citizens in a democracy, to make good, informed choices, to live in peace with their neighbors and coworkers, and to enjoy life to its fullest. Let us begin to show our commitment to our children by prioritizing funding for the arts and encouraging arts programs in our schools and communities.Later in the debate, Mr. Chairman, an amendment will be offered to increase funding for the NEA, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.,2015-03-17 19:11:13.968773,2015-03-17 19:11:13.968773,House,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000,1999-07-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-13/html/CREC-1999-07-13-pt1-PgH5396-3.htm,98,21,145,H5396-H5433,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2779,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the newly elected and consecrated Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, the Right Reverend Vernon Randolph Byrd. He joins Rev. Dr. W. Bartalette Finney, Sr., Presiding Elder, Rev. Ralph J. Crabbe, and leaders in our community who contribute to the spiritual needs of our greater metropolitan area.Bishop Byrd's spiritual education began at the age of twelve when he received his call to preach. By the time he was a teenager, he was ordained to preach by the late Bishop Frank Madison Reed, Sr. Bishop Byrd was a success In school and graduated from the public schools of South Carolina, and earned degrees at Allen University, and Boston University.Prior to his tenure at the Northwest Missouri Conference Fifth District AME Church in Kansas City, Bishop Byrd served as a Pastor and Presiding Elder at several churches. His ministry served congregations including the Macedonia AME Church in Delware, the St. Paul AME Church in Bermuda, the Newark District-New Jersey Conference, the Macedonia AME Church in New Jersey, the Morris Brown AME Church in Pennsylvania, and the St. James AME Church in New Jersey.In 1984, Bishop Byrd was elevated to the episcopacy at the seat of the Forty-Second Quadrennial Session of the General Conference. A recipient of numerous awards, he has been honored with the Trumiunz Award for outstanding work with retarded children in Delaware. He was recognized as an Honorary Member of the British Empire Medal by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who bestowed the award to him for helping bring order to the Bermuda Isles during a period of civil unrest in 1964. Byrd was also named the 1966 Outstanding Young Man of the Year by the Bermuda Chamber of Commerce and given an Honorary Doctorate Degree from the Payne Theological Seminary in 1994.Always involved with his community, he is an active member of civil and fraternal organizations, the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, the Royal Masonic Lodge of Scotland, and the NAACP. Bishop Byrd is married to retired school teacher, Theora Lindsey Byrd who serves the Church as the Women's Missionary Society Supervisor where they teach to others that ``Unless Souls Are Saved * * * Nothing Is Saved!''

2780,MO,William,Clay,D,I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.Mr. Speaker, if the Republican leadership had done its job instead of playing politics with appropriations for vital government services, I would not be here this morning to speak on this unnecessary continuing resolution and to oppose H.R. 3064, which includes the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Act, because if passed it would make drastic cuts in programs that are vitally important to Americans, especially to those most in need of the Federal Government's assistance and protection.Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, this ill-conceived and sensitive bill faces swift death at the hands of a veto by the President. Many of the important initiatives proposed by the President to improve our schools and to prepare our children for the 21st century have either been eliminated or underfunded. The bill that we will be considering after this guts the Clinton-Clay plan to hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class sizes in the early grades. Instead, it diverts $1.2 billion to a block grant that requires no real accountability and would permit spending public money to send children to private schools.Mr. Speaker, last week this body overwhelmingly defeated the Republican majority leader's ill-advised attempt to authorize vouchers for private and public schools. Now the same misguided leadership is attempting a backdoor enactment of the same raid on public funds. The cuts in H.R. 3064 are devastating. The Republicans' bill cuts $26 million from the President's funding request to improve the reading skills of 100,000 students as proposed in the Reading Excellence Act. The Republicans' bill denies $60 million of the President's funding request for Gear Up, thus preventing 131,000 low-income students from receiving mentoring, counseling and tutoring services intended to help them prepare for college.The bill provides $300 billion less than the President requested for after-school enrichment centers, thereby funding 3,400 fewer centers; and after selling our children and teachers short, the Republicans' bill also reflects the same legislative assault on workers. The bill would undermine worker protection programs by cutting $18 million from the President's request for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Funding for the Labor Relations Board is cut by $10 million below the President's request, which will result in total gridlock in resolving labor-management disputes.Mr. Speaker, I recommend that we defeat the bill that comes after this continuing resolution.,2015-03-17 19:11:14.597215,2015-03-17 19:11:14.597215,House,FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2000,1999-10-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-28/html/CREC-1999-10-28-pt1-PgH11075.htm,149,13,145,H11075-H11085,C000488,mr. clay
2781,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, November 13, 1999, Justin ``Jo Mo'' Robinson is being honored by the Sikeston, MO ``Daughters of Sunset'' at their 15th Annual Recognition Program. I would like to extend my congratulations to Justin who is being recognized on this day as the Outstanding Athlete of The Year.Justin is the son of Frank and Jeanette McCaster. He is the youngest of six children, four boys and two girls. Justin is a senior at Sikeston Senior High School.Justin has played sports for several years, starting with Little League football, baseball and basketball. In his spare time, Justin enjoys fishing and playing pool. His greatest love, though, is football.According to Justin's football coach, Charlie Vickery, Justin's football achievement include senior running back and 1999 football captain. Justin leads the Southeast Missouri area in rushing yards at 1,464, which is currently third in Sikeston history for single season yards. Justine also has 20 touchdowns, which ranks him second in Southeast Missouri, and he is tied for second in single season touchdowns in Sikeston Senior High School Bulldog records. With three games remaining in this year's season, Justin has an excellent chance to break the single season rushing record of 1,771 yards held by Tiger Boyd and the single season touchdown record of 21 also held by Boyd. Justin has chosen as a second team All-Conference Running Back as a junior in 1998. Justin's role model is one of Sikeston, MO's greatest players, James Wilder. After graduating, Justin plans to attend the University of Arkansas to play football and run track. He would like to earn a degree in physical education. One of Justin's greatest ambitions is to play professional football, but he plans to return to Sikeston, MO to share his accomplishments with all those who have supported and loved him.Justin often says that without his mother's love and faith in him, it's hard to say where he might be. Justin offers this advice to his peers, ``Stay in school and be the best you can be, and make sure to always listen to your parents.''Congratulations, Justin, on your recognition by the ``Daughters of Sunset.'' Your achievements as an athlete and as a faithful son make you a true role model for your friends and peers in Sikeston.

2782,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, once again I am befuddled, bewildered, but mostly amazed by the explanation given by the chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce of what this resolution does.He says it is only one of many methods that can be used to teach reading. But I am reading the resolution itself, and it says ``direct systematic phonics instruction should be used in all schools as a first and essential step in teaching a student to read.''Mr. Speaker, this resolution states that phonics-based instruction should be used by all schools in their efforts to teach children to read and should be included in pre-service teaching requirements.What other insulting gimmicks will the Republican leadership think of next? This resolution ignores the volumes of research on reading instruction that shows the need for a balance between phonics and whole language instructional techniques. This resolution also takes the unprecedented and demeaning step of placing Congress in the classroom by dictating a particular curriculum choice, regardless of the view of our teachers, principals and superintendents at the local level. Is this what Republicans mean when they say Washington knows what is best for local communities?Mr. Speaker, when our committee considered the President's America Reads legislation during the last Congress, we learned from witness after witness that a solely phonics-based curriculum or solely whole language based curriculum is not effective in teaching children to read.Last year, reading instruction experts testified before our committee that a balanced approach, using phonics and whole language, is the most effective and proven way to teach children to read.What is most objectionable about this resolution is its forcible intrusion into the classroom through a Federal endorsement of what should be locally determined curriculum.Why does the Congress need to make an affirmative statement that phonics and phonics solely should be utilized in schools? I say that anyone who votes for this resolution dictating how teachers and local school boards should teach reading should never again speak of local control of our schools.Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this resolution.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:15.121587,2015-03-17 19:11:15.121587,House,SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD USE PHONICS,1999-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-04/html/CREC-1999-11-04-pt1-PgH11489-2.htm,154,6,145,H11489-H11499,C000488,mr. clay
2783,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the supplemental. It's actually something that I voted on not so long ago, but things have changed. Things have changed radically. In fact, it seems that the Obama administration has included in this supplemental a request for $108 billion, taking money away from defense and putting it into the International Monetary Fund. Now, they call that the IMF. A lot of people don't know what the IMF is, but here we are taking money away from our defense spending, away from our soldiers and away from our taxpayers, and we're going to put it into this International Monetary Fund.Exactly what does that do?Well, that allows some of our good friends, like Iran and Venezuela, to access this money to build their country and their programs and to use it according to the dictates of the way they run their countries. These are not only our competitors, but they are the countries that do the most they can to cause us trouble. So why in the world do we want to levy more taxes on our taxpayers, take the money that was for defense and give it away to our enemies? It doesn't make any sense.This should not be included in the defense supplemental. This should be about taking care of our men and women in uniform. It should be about taking care of their equipment, their needs, their education, and the training that they need, not about giving money away to the international community to be used in who knows what way by who knows what country.So as strong as I am on defense--and I've always been a strong defender. I've been on the Armed Services Committee for 9 years. I have three sons who've graduated from the Naval Academy. This will not stand. I will not vote for a supplemental that is giving money to some foreign country, money that should go to our soldiers.

2784,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the Congress and the President have come together to find common ground on the fiscal year 2008 budget. It is often said that politics is the art of compromise, and the bill we are considering today--H.R. 2764--represents a compromise position that allows the Congressional majority to advance some of its priorities while adhering to the President's overall budgetary constraints.H.R. 2764 funds a number of programs that are important to the American people, including investments in education, life-saving medical research, law enforcement, border security, veterans' health care, and energy independence initiatives.H.R. 2764 is especially good for rural America. The bill rejects deep cuts that were proposed by the President in rural health care, housing, economic development, Internet access, and law enforcement programs. At the same time, the bill nearly doubles funds available for renewable energy loans and grants in rural areas, commits significant resources to fix aging bridges, and adds $1 million to the President's request for rural drinking water and waste water infrastructure projects. Additionally, the measure slashes funding for the Administration's efforts to create a National Animal Identification Program, reducing it by $23 million.H.R. 2764 also extends through December 31, 2007, most of the agricultural disaster assistance programs included as part of the emergency supplemental spending bill signed into law earlier this year. These programs allow many American farmers to recoup some losses associated with drought and other natural disasters in 2005, 2006, or in the first two months of 2007. Between February and December of this year, Missouri farmers have seen their fair share of damaging weather events. I am pleased that Congress is extending disaster programs that may be beneficial to qualifying Show-Me State producers.The measure also funds U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. And, while I would have preferred to send the President war funding legislation that sets a goal of redeploying most American troops from Iraq by next Christmas, H.R. 2764 will provide our service men and women with the resources they need to do their jobs while serving in harm's way and will alleviate any need by the Administration to reallocate funds from domestic military operations.H.R. 2764 represents a compromise bill that is in the best interest of our Nation.

Throughout its history, CPH has grown both in size and scope while providing the very best products and services to customers around the world.CPH's successful customer-focused business model distinguishes their business as one of the best in the industry and has earned noteworthy praise. With a near-perfect customer satisfaction score, CPH's customer call center was ranked a center of excellence by a Purdue University study for 3 consecutive years. CPH pairs their outstanding customer care with state-of-the-art products and technology. From being one of the first St. Louis companies to utilize an IBM online data filing system, to delivering eProducts on iPhones and iPads, the company has always embraced the latest technology in service of their clients. CPH's rank as one of the ``Best Christian Workplaces in the United States'' in 2009, 2010, and 2011, illustrates their focus on employee satisfaction and well-being.Named after the 26th U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldridge, the Baldridge Award was established by Congress in 1987 to enhance the competitiveness and performance of U.S. businesses. It is the highest Presidential honor for business performance. Recipients serve as role models not only for their peers in the nonprofit and business sectors but for every American organization that strives for a higher standard of performance and overall excellence.The 2011 Baldridge Award winners were selected from a field of 69 applicants. Applicants were evaluated based on seven areas defined by the Baldridge Criteria for Performance Excellence: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; managements, analysis and knowledge management; workforce focus; operations focus; and results.Mr. President, 142 years after its founding, Concordia Publishing House continues to fulfill their mission to provide the LCMS community with the best possible products and services.

2786,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sergeant First Class Frederic Nicholas Moses. A combat decorated veteran who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to serve his country, to protect those who could not protect themselves.SFC Moses was born on 06 May 1985 in St. Charles, Missouri. He graduated from Duchesne High School in St. Charles, Missouri in 2003 and enlisted in the United States Army on 01 June 2004 as an 18X. He attended Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Upon completion of the Special Forces Qualification Course in 2006, he was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky as a Special Forces Communications Sergeant. He deployed with the Battalion Signal Detachment to Taji, Iraq from October 2007 to May 2008 in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM V. He went on to join Special Forces Operational Detachment--Alpha 5326, and deployed with them to Baqubah, Iraq from January through July 2009 in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM VI, and conducted a Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) exercise to Jordan from January through March 2010. SFC Moses then deployed to Baqubah, Iraq from August 2010 through March 2011 in support of Operation NEW DAWN. Following a short training cycle, he returned to Jordan for a second JCET exercise from October through November 2011.Most recently, SFC Moses deployed to Baghlan-e-Jadid, Afghanistan from January through February 2012 in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM XVIII. SFC Moses' military education included Airborne School, Special Forces Assessment and Selection, Survival, Escape, Resistance and Evasion Course, Special Forces Qualification Course, Ranger School, Jumpmaster School, Basic Military Mountaineering Course, and the Advanced Special Operations Techniques Course. SFC Moses' awards and decorations included the Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and Army Achievement Medal. His decorations included the Special Forces Tab, Ranger Tab, Combat Infantryman Badge, and Parachutist Badge.Today, we pay our respects and honor the life of Frederic Nicolas ``Nic'' Moses. His dedication to his job and fellow soldiers was unquestionable and unwavering. A hero to many, the community of St. Charles, and all who have served with him, will miss him.To his family, we offer our prayers and gratitude for providing the world a great young man who made a positive impact on not only his community, but communities around the world.I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring the life of Nicholas Moses.,2015-03-17 19:11:15.891141,2015-03-17 19:11:15.891141,Extensions,REMEMBERING AND HONORING THE LIFE OF SERGEANT FIRST CLASS FREDERIC NICHOLAS MOSES,2012-03-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-03-29/html/CREC-2012-03-29-pt1-PgE491-4.htm,52,0,158,E491-E492,A000358,mr. akin
2787,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Nurses For Newborns Organization, as they celebrate their 20th anniversary.Since 1992, Nurses For Newborns has served our most vulnerable citizens-newborn babies. As a nurse home visiting agency, volunteers help provide a safety net for families most at risk to help prevent infant mortality, child abuse, and neglect through home based programs that provide education, healthcare, and positive parenting skills. Services also include programs for teen moms and moms that are mentally and physically challenged, as well as referrals to medical, social or government services.Nurses visiting new mothers for whom poverty is the primary risk factor provide maternal depression, risk for domestic violence and child abuse and neglect screenings in the home. ``Medically fragile'' babies--those born prematurely, diagnosed with Down Syndrome or other genetic disorders, or who have been exposed to drugs or alcohol are afforded extra special care by volunteer nurses.Moms with intellectual or physical disabilities who need assistance with routine tasks like formula preparation and feeding; administration of medications or managing appointment schedules will receive support from Nurses For Newborns with more frequent home visits.Our citizens have rallied around this worthy organization. Churches, school groups, and businesses, and community members routinely donate clothes, toys, diapers, blankets, car seats, baby beds, and formula to the Nurses For Newborns organization, for families in need.Evidence based outcomes of the hard work of Nurses For Newborns staff and volunteers are impressive. Ninety-nine percent of babies whose parents are enrolled in the program do not suffer from abuse or neglect; 89 percent are current with immunization schedule; 99 percent have established a medical home for their babies, and 99 percent are not unnecessarily hospitalized.I thank Chief Executive Officer Melinda Ohlemiller, her staff, and all of the volunteers who have made Nurses For Newborns the effective and vitally important organization that it is today. Because of their compassion and hard work, all St. Louis area babies can have the best possible start and the brightest possible future.,2015-03-17 19:11:16.045243,2015-03-17 19:11:16.045243,Extensions,IN HONOR OF NURSES FOR NEWBORNS,2012-04-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-04-19/html/CREC-2012-04-19-pt1-PgE600-2.htm,57,0,158,E600,C001060,mr. carnahan
2788,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Linda Henke, for her years of service to the people of the St. Louis area.Dr. Henke is retiring as Superintendent of the Maplewood Richmond Heights School District, MRH, where she demonstrated a true passion for excellence during her years of service. When she first joined MRH, the district was one point away from losing its accreditation from the state of Missouri. After a decade under Dr. Henke's guidance, the school district now operates with Missouri's top Annual Performance Report Score; a true testament to Dr. Henke's hard work, dedication, and leadership.Her personal approach towards the staff and the students has been a hallmark of her tenure. She made a point to know the staff and the students by name, and she attended nearly all sporting events, school plays, and concerts her students took part in. She actively sought to include her students in the development of successful school policies by regularly meeting with an advisory team of middle and high school students to openly discuss problems and possible solutions.Dr. Henke not only cares about her students' academic success, but also about their health and well-being. I have had the pleasure of working with Dr. Henke as she has endeavored to provide locally produced, healthy food choices to her students in the cafeteria. She has worked hard to engage students in learning about our food system and teaching them that good eating habits are connected to excellence in education.Her life has been defined by remarkable service to others. Dr. Henke has an exceptional ability to identify needs and works to fulfill them, as she has demonstrated many times while leading the MRH school district. A great example of this was when she saw that some students and families had lost their homes and had trouble finding regular meals. She addressed this by developing Joe's Place, where teenage boys can go to find affection, support, a home, and regular meals. In previous years, each of the boys who lived at Joe's Place not only graduated from MRH High School, but also went on to attend college. In many cases, they were the first members of their families to accomplish this feat.Without Dr. Henke's passion for her students and determination to provide them with every opportunity for success, MRH would not be the model school district it is today. Educators from across the country visit MRH schools to understand how she has transformed the district, and how they can replicate her successful programs in their own districts.I congratulate Dr. Linda Henke on her retirement, and I thank her for her service to our community.,2015-03-17 19:11:16.258395,2015-03-17 19:11:16.258395,Extensions,IN HONOR OF DR.

2789,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miss Sydney Everett, an outstanding high school graduate of Metro Academic & Classical High School in the great city of St. Louis, Missouri. Indeed, there are many recent high school graduates who deserve significant accolades for their commendable academic achievements. However, Sydney is a rare instance of intellectual rigor coupled with an enduring and heartfelt commitment to the well-being of her community. Given her extensive track record of high academic standings and numerous extracurricular activities, Sydney was offered over $1.2 million in school based scholarships and academic grants from nine institutions of higher education.Sydney Everett's story is that of a young American woman whose tenacity and resolve have allowed her to thrive in her academics and extracurricular activities. While attending Metro Academy, she immersed herself in the most rigorous curriculum available at her high school as a candidate for a full International Baccalaureate diploma. She has always challenged herself to broaden her understanding and extend the horizon of her knowledge. Yet, her drive extends far beyond the walls of the classroom.Sydney is deeply involved in the functions of her school with an extensive and well-rounded resume of extracurricular activities including her involvement in her school's student council, concert band, policy debate team, and literary magazine. Moreover, she genuinely values the time she gives back to the St. Louis community as a volunteer at a local church and elementary school.Before her junior year, Sydney served as a Congressional Page and proudly represented my district in the United States House of Representatives. Additionally, she participated in my Congressional Youth Cabinet, which is an organization I founded to provide outstanding high school students across the St. Louis area with the opportunity to advise myself and my staff on key local and national issues. With her hard work ethic and strong social conscience, Sydney was a valuable advisor to my office.Sydney has left an indelible impact on her school and her community, and she will be sorely missed when she advances to college. She will attend Barnard College at Columbia University in the fall and intends to earn a degree in international human rights law with hopes of attending law school and one day representing people and organizations throughout the world that are fighting for human rights.Mr. Speaker, it is not every day that we come across such talented and caring students like Sydney Everett. Her unique accomplishments serve as an example for every student in St. Louis and across the United States. It is a great honor to recognize her relentless passion for knowledge, unwavering dedication to her community, and humble character in light of such great achievements.,2015-03-17 19:11:16.535591,2015-03-17 19:11:16.535591,Extensions,MS.

2790,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam President, as we continue our debate about health care reform, I would like to recognize an organization in Missouri that has been a leader in innovation in driving down the healthcare costs for manufacturers and their employees. The Missouri Association of Manufacturers and their CEO, Rita Needham, have been at the forefront of the debate in my State. She is committed to new strategies to provide affordable health care through consortiums of manufacturers that employ more than 2,100 people.As an educator, human resource manager and administrator, Rita Needham joined the Southwest Area Missouri Association, SAMA, in 1999 as community affairs director. SAMA reached out to support manufacturers in the Springfield, MO area. Needham was elevated to executive director 2 years later and created a health care consortium which provided affordable health care coverage for manufacturers.Rita was the driving force in obtaining a two-year waiver from the Missouri Department of Insurance to enable companies of all sizes to join together in a pilot program to purchase group health insurance. Before the consortium was created, the initial 32 companies who joined the SAMA I Consortium had to buy their health insurance individually, but, under the consortium, they were rated as one policy holder therefore achieving significant savings. Six smaller companies who were part of the consortium were able to access affordable health care for the first time. The consortium members were able to achieve long term rate stability, create large group buying power and reduce claim risk in response to their biggest concern--the rising costs of health care.In 2006, Rita led SAMA's efforts to persuade the Missouri General Assembly to pass House bill 1827, landmark legislation known as the SAMA bill, which allowed manufacturers of all sizes the option of purchasing a group health plan under the consortium.In 2010, the Southwest Area Manufacturers Association became the Missouri Association of Manufacturers, MAM, with 170 member companies across the State representing 14,500 employees. Today, MAM is a strong voice for manufacturing with free market positions on trade, regulation, tax and energy policy, education, health care and the environment.Rita is planning to retire this year, but throughout her career she has been a thoughtful, dedicated leader for Missouri manufacturers. I have always relied on her expertise and common sense to better understand how Federal policy impacts health costs for manufacturers.I wish Rita and her husband Jim a wonderful retirement. There is no doubt that Rita's advocacy and smart leadership have improved the business environment in Missouri. ,2015-03-17 19:11:16.669717,2015-03-17 19:11:16.669717,Senate,TRIBUTE TO RITA NEEDHAM,2013-09-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-09-17/html/CREC-2013-09-17-pt1-PgS6514.htm,122,0,159,S6514,B000575,mr. blunt
2791,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring the 150th anniversary of the State of Missouri's Emancipation Proclamation which ended slavery in the State of Missouri. This proclamation of freedom was imperative for democracy and progress in our State. It is undoubtedly a landmark in Missouri's history.In 1720, the arrival of 500 slaves to the areas presently known as St. Louis County and Jefferson County, marked the beginning of slavery in Missouri. Those slaves, who were brought to work in the lead mines in those counties, experienced great discrimination over the course of 1\1/2\ centuries. When the Territorial Slave Codes were created in 1804, slaves were banned from using firearms, participating in assemblies, holding church services and selling alcohol. Under the codes, slaves were also punished severely for participating in resistance efforts and the mutilation of slaves for the sexual assault of white women was made legal. White men who sexually assaulted slave women, however, were charged for trespassing upon a slave owner's property.Retained by the State Constitution in 1820, the Territorial Slave Codes were only a premonition of more to come. In 1821, Missouri entered the Union as a slave State with the passing of the Missouri Compromise and in 1825, the Missouri Legislature passed a law which declared slaves to be incompetent as witnesses in legal cases involving whites. That gloomy trend continued as the education of slaves was banned in an 1847 ordinance. One of the most foreboding events, however, occurred in 1857 with the infamous Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford when the judicial system in the state of Missouri and the wider judicial system in the United States decided that persons of African descent were not U.S. citizens.At the time of the Civil War, over 100,000 slaves were living in the State of Missouri and when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Missouri's slaves were not freed as Missouri was not officially in rebellion against the United States. Missouri's slaves received their freedom on January 11, 1865, when the Emancipation Ordinance was signed at a State convention in St. Louis. That ordinance was made effective immediately and the strict codes of the past were eliminated.I ask that the Senate join me in reflecting upon this difficult time in Missouri's history and honoring the historical significance of the Emancipation Ordinance which ended slavery in the State of Missouri, 150 years ago.,2015-03-17 19:11:16.824798,2015-03-17 19:11:16.824798,Senate,MISSOURI'S EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION,2015-01-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2015-01-12/html/CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgS147.htm,5,0,161,S147-S148,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2792,MO,Todd,Akin,R,You know, the thing that's exciting to me and encouraging to me, it's not just you gentlemen, but the fact that you came here because America was waking up. America is saying it's time to take back America. We're tired of being bullied by our own government. And we're tired of the idea that what you should do is to be paid for not doing something, and that an existence in America is sitting around and not having a job. What we want is we want Americans to be able to follow the dreams that are in their heart, you know. And the mentality of the fact that anybody looks like they're having fun, we want to tax them, that just doesn't make any sense at all.And sometimes it seems like it's such a gloomy perspective to think of America as a country which is nothing but the government's going to take care of you. You know, the Soviet Union years and years ago, they had this basic idea the government's going to provide you with a home; it's going to provide you with food; it's going to provide you with medical care; it's going to provide you with an education; the government's going to provide you with a job. That was their formula, and it didn't work worth a hoot. And the Soviet Union collapsed. It's in the dustbin of history.And here what are we doing? We're trying to look at the government to provide you food and a home and an education. The government's going to provide you health care and the government's going to provide you a job, or if you don't have a job, they'll pay you anyway. That's a formula that didn't work. There's no point in going down that blind alley again.So what we are coming back to again is the thing that's just so exciting about our country. It's a country of exceptionalism. It's a country that's led the world. It's a country that is a source of hope for people all around the world as they take a look at our country.It was interesting, during the days of Ronald Reagan, that he got a message out of some of the concentration camps up in Siberia and gulag and different places that were really rough. And the people were thirsty for news of what was happening with America and they were praying for us, because they realized that we were a source of hope and inspiration to the rest of the world.There was a group of our Founders, came over on a boat, it was called the Lion. It was 1630--it was some of the Puritans under Winthrop--and they wrote something called ``The Model of Christian Charity.'' It was a long, sort of a long Puritan-type document. But it said something about we must consider that we should be a city on a hill, a light to the people around the world.And that was where Reagan picked that up in his speeches. Of course, it came out of the Bible that we should be a city on a hill, a light to people of the world, a good example and an inspiration so that they would think of also being free from the influence of excessive government.So that's the challenge that you as freshmen, that all of us, all Americans are facing. I think people are starting to understand this is going to mean some changes. There are going be changes in our behavioral pattern and the fact that we have just got to start cutting back on government and we just can't continue to let the thing run the way we have.The bottom line, as we get back to it, I want to restate the problem, and the problem is this, that when you put those entitlement programs with the debt service together, we are spending almost the same amount of money as what we take in in revenue. That's not a penny for defense or discretionary spending at all. That's where we are. That's pretty sobering.That's why the challenge is significant. We are not going to get there overnight. We are not going to balance the budget in 1 year.I don't even think the most conservative guy in Congress would think that we could do that, that there is any probability that America could adjust that rapidly.But we can balance a budget and we must. The fact is we have to take steady steps, one at a time, and move forward on this because of the fact that we are protecting that most precious idea that America has been that hope and that bright light on a hill for people all around the world.The aspect of America and the American Dream, there is something that I talked about sometimes when I was doing some campaigning. I like to throw into the mix there the concept that in following the dream that's in your heart, it takes a certain amount of courage. Those people like Thomas Edison, the people that came by the Statue of Liberty with the shirt on their back and a little change in their pocket, it took guts to do that. It's going to take guts to go where we have to go. But with courage and God's blessing we can do it, gentlemen.God bless you all.,2015-03-17 19:11:16.978913,2015-03-17 19:11:16.978913,House,GOVERNMENT OVERSPENDING,2011-01-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-01-20/html/CREC-2011-01-20-pt1-PgH380-3.htm,8,49,157,H380-H386,A000358,mr. akin
2793,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Thank you for that insight and the wisdom that you have shared with us. This is a graph of actually what happens over time. And this is this effect I was talking about. You know, when you were flying those old-fashioned airplanes and you wanted to not drive your airplane into the dirt, what you had to do was push the stick forward, which would stop the spin. The plane would start to dive; but when you had control, you could pull the stick back. That seemed counterintuitive. Pilots for years would get in that graveyard spiral, and they would keep hitting the ground until this one crazy pilot said I am going to take my airplane up, I am going to put it in a graveyard spiral, and I have a solution, I believe, to pull it out of the spiral and live. So he bet his life on his solution. And he put it in the graveyard spiral, he pushed the stick forward, the plane stabilized, and then he eased the stick back, and the plane pulled out, and all the people on the ground went, whoa, that was a gutsy move.That's a little counterintuitive. When you are out of control going down, your temptation is to jerk the stick up, which is what the Democrats are doing. They are raising taxes, making the situation worse, turning a recession into a depression. And what you have got to do is to learn from the pilots who had before you figured out how to do it. One of them, ironically, was JFK. Now, that guy's a Democrat, and they didn't learn from him. Because he was in a recession and he said less taxes, and the economy recovered.Then a guy came along by the name of Ronald Reagan. He cut taxes like mad. Guess what happened? Recovery of the economy. Then comes along Bush. Cuts taxes. Recovery again. I mean, we have seen it over and over. Here it is and it's counterintuitive. Why in the world if you cut taxes could the government have more revenue and get the economy going?Well, here is what happens. And think about it a little bit like this. Say you are king for a day, Congressman Broun, you are king for a day and you are allowed to tax loaves of bread. And you are thinking in your mind now you have been technically trained as a doctor, you are a scientific thinker, and you have got these loaves of bread, how much are you going to tax a loaf of bread? First you think, huh, maybe a penny, because no one will notice a penny tax on a loaf of bread. Then you think, yeah, but if I taxed them more, I could get more money. So you say, huh, maybe $10. Then you think, ah, no, maybe they wouldn't pay $10 tax. So somewhere between $10 and a penny there is an optimum tax to tax a loaf of bread to raise money for the government.Well, the same kind of thing goes on on a larger scale. And what this guy Laffer understood was if you drop taxes, what happens is the economy gets going. When it gets going, there are more transactions. And so even a lower tax rate will generate more revenue.So here is what he did. This is like that airplane. He is dropping taxes here, and take a look at government revenues. Government revenues are going up and taxes are down. That seems like making water run uphill, but it's not. Because when you get the economy going, then a lower tax rate actually generates more money. And that's the solution out of this problem.So let's talk about what is it we have to do. We have to learn, if nothing else, from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had the philosophy that the government is going to give you health care, the government's going to give you an education, the government's going to provide for your retirement, it's going to give you housing and food. The government's going to do all of that. And we laughed. Because we said you can't--that socialism, that communism-socialism doesn't work. And yet what are we doing here? The same thing.We are deciding the government's going to do health care, the government's going to do your education, the government's going to do your housing, and then the food stamps. It doesn't work. So what I think we understand is the government is just going to have to get out of the business of taking care of everybody and get back in the business of just simply managing the economy, providing for the national defense, and they are going to have to push all of that decision-making down to the State level and let the States do it. So we have to have a good breath of freedom and fresh air instead of the big Obama welfare state that we are doing.Congressman Broun.,2015-03-17 19:11:17.135023,2015-03-17 19:11:17.135023,House,THE ISRAEL BLOCKADE AND THE FLOTILLA,2010-06-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-09/html/CREC-2010-06-09-pt1-PgH4314-3.htm,86,57,156,H4314-H4321,A000358,mr. akin

Irrigation research had traditionally been done in dry parts of the country. However, results from these arid studies from areas where it is continuously dry are not always appropriate to the Mw/MS conditions, which can experience droughty periods followed by heavy rains, has hard pan soils, and disease pressure from high humidity. Since the Mw/MS is a historically underserved area in regards irrigation research, its farmers were not as able to grow irrigated crops as profitably as they could. It is imperative that research be conducted to answer the question of how best to irrigate in a semi-humid area. Research is being done on crop response to water logging, on scheduling irrigation using sensors, on row configurations, on conserving energy, on managing field variability, and growing rice more profitably. The project is a cooperative effort between USDA/ARS and the University of Missouri. Approximately, 80% is for salary and benefits, 12% for supplies, 7% for domestic travel, and 1% for soil and plant tissue testing. The data gathered from these studies have already made a difference in the financial situation of area farmers. Approximately 20% of the irrigators are using scientific irrigation scheduling, which is a much higher rate then most other regions of the USA. This has led to increases in yield that are worth about $13,000,000 annually. The trend line of the regional averaged yield for irrigated crops is increasing at a higher rate than is the trend line for dryland yields. This is an excellent indication that irrigators are becoming more proficient, due in large part to the Midwest/Mid-South Irrigation Project.Project Name: Rice Agronomy, MOBill Number: H.R. 1105Account: Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Curators of the University of MissouriAddress of Requesting Entity: 316 University Hall, Columbia, MO 65211Description of Request: For Rice Agronomy, MO (CSREES), provide an earmark of $174,000 to complete a rice agronomy project being conducted at the Delta Research Center.

2795,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my friend and former colleague, as well as an outstanding woman of service, Carole Roper Park Vaughan. From 1977 through 1994, Carole represented the 51st District of Missouri, which includes the home of President Harry S. Truman, in the Missouri House of Representatives. On September 18, Carole will celebrate her 70th birthday, and I just want to take a few minutes today to honor her and the contribution she made to so many lives in Missouri.Carole was born to Rudy and Rose Roper of Sugar Creek, MO, both children of Croatian emigrants. Carole's father served as the mayor of Sugar Creek for 40 years, from 1940 until 1980, so she came by her political acumen naturally. In fact, while other little girls were playing with dolls, stuffed animals, or having teas, Carole was with her father learning the art of making a deal, a skill she would later take with her to the State legislature.Though politics was in her blood, her dedication to public service did not begin with elected office. After graduating from the University of Missouri-Kansas City with a bachelor of arts degree in education, Carole pursued a teaching career in the Kansas City school district. For 12 years, she taught elementary education in some of the poorest school districts in the Kansas City area. It was here that she fully realized the importance of community involvement. Her students were faced with everyday challenges she had never experienced before, and there was a real need for change. As a teacher, however, Carole felt she was limited in how she could effect the meaningful change that was desperately needed in her community.Despite her pedigree and desire to make a difference, Carole's ascension into public office happened almost by accident. When the current legislator in her district suddenly became ill and died, those in the community who were impressed by her interest in changing the status quo encouraged her run. She filed for office on the day of the filing deadline, and in 1976, she was elected to represent the 51st District of Missouri. Thankfully, for the people of Missouri, there was nothing accidental about her approach to legislating. Hailing from the home of Harry Truman, Carole had a real no-nonsense style about her, and she could get things done.During her 18 years as a member of the Missouri House of Representatives, Carole sponsored 93 bills, many of which became law, including the largest insurance reform bill in Missouri history. But what Carole was most known for was her vigorous pursuit to improve the way the State of Missouri delivered health and mental health care. In 1981, she became the first woman in Missouri history to chair a standing appropriations committee, and for 13 years Carole reigned over the Committee on Appropriations for Health and Mental Health. At the time she was appointed to this position, Missouri was headed into a recession, and there was a desperate need to cut health services. Yet Carole was able to make the necessary changes without sacrificing services. In fact, throughout her tenure as chair of the committee, Missouri reduced overall costs of mental health care programs while improving the services it provided.Carole's dedication to those suffering from mental illness, developmental disabilities, head injuries, and substance abuse was truly unparalleled. While her work with community mental health centers or substance abuse programs seldom made the front page, she worked tirelessly in the pursuit of better treatment for these special citizens. The result of her dedication was the transformation of a badly broken mental health system into a community-based approach that provided real options for some of our most vulnerable.In 1995, Carole retired from the Missouri House of Representatives, but her commitment to her community and the democratic process has continued. She has remained dedicated to improving services for the mentally ill, substance abusers, and victims of domestic violence. She has worked with Thank You Walt Disney Inc. to help restore Walt Disney's downtown Kansas City Studio. She has worked tirelessly to elect democratic candidates who embody the same steadfast dedication to effect change that she had during her time in public service, including devoting countless hours on the phones and going door-to-door for then Presidential candidate Barack Obama. Once again, her hard work paid off.Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in wishing Carole Roper Park Vaughan a very happy 70th birthday. She has been a remarkable servant to the citizens of the State of Missouri and I am grateful to call her my friend. ,2015-03-17 19:11:17.612363,2015-03-17 19:11:17.612363,Senate,COMMENDING CAROLE ROPER PARK VAUGHAN,2009-09-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-16/html/CREC-2009-09-16-pt1-PgS9429-3.htm,131,0,155,S9429-S9430,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2796,MO,Todd,Akin,R,So we have the ``too big to fail'' rule. So we tax Americans, not so much Americans that live now but their grandchildren we're going to tax, and we pass these things like the porkulus bill, which is supposed to be stimulus, and we pass the Wall Street bailout. We take all this money and we give it to whom? Every small mom and pop shop that might fail? No. We give it to the ``too big to fail.'' So, therefore, you've moved from the rule of law to a special deals society. And that's the problem. Of course, that's really what socialism is. It's special deals administered by guess who, Big Brother government.That's not what made America great. That's not what allowed our great Nation, my good friend Congressman King, that's not what allowed us to have a list of the different nations throughout the world that Americans freed from horrible dictatorships. That's a long list. I saw it actually listed on a cartoon. It had the list of all of these countries that American GIs and that American treasure through the ages have freed. Places like Germany. Places like Japan where you have some dictator, where we went in and we freed them from that. Places like Grenada, where our sons and daughters went in and took a risk and left a free country. That's not why we were able to do that because we're another socialist Big Government-run country. It's because we're a country that was based on a different set of principles.The thing that strikes me the most, and I don't want to overuse the welcome that you've extended to me, is this. There was a country not so many years ago, and this is how their thinking worked: They said, look, if you've got somebody and they don't have a house to stay in and it gets cold in the winter, they're going to freeze to death. And if they don't have food to eat, they're going to starve to death. And if they don't have medical care, they're going to die of some kind of medical condition. So they ought to have a right to housing, a right to food, a right to health care. And if they haven't had an education and they can't read, they ought to have a right to know how to read and to study and be educated. So that government created those rights for its citizens, and they marched forward boldly into the future until they became bankrupt and were disbanded. And it was called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We call it the USSR. And we knew it wasn't a very good system because it was based on communism and socialism.Yet here in America, we have heard, even as I have stood here on the floor with you my friend, Democrats say that you have a right to health care. So as a government, we are now saying that we're going to have the government get involved in housing. The government's going to get involved in food, in food stamps. The government is now going to take over health care. The government has now taken over most of the loans for colleges and education. And it's like how come we're repeating the same things that the Soviet Union did and anticipating that we'll get different results?Instead, our Founders had a different concept. They said that our rights are basic things that come from God. In our Declaration of Independence, all are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If you'll note, those rights are not rights to something that somebody else has a claim to.Those of you from Iowa do some farming. I think you grow some corn in Iowa. I know we do some in Missouri, but our next-door neighbor does a lot of wheat and corn. And when you have one of your Iowa farmers combine the sweat of his brow with the produce from the field, they own that corn. It is their corn because it was grown on their land. They worked hard and it belongs to them. We call that private property. We call that free enterprise. And because I'm hungry doesn't give me a right to something that belongs to someone else. That's theft. That's stealing. And if the government takes someone's corn and gives it to someone else who didn't grow it, that's called stealing, except we just call it institutionalized theft. That's socialism. You never have a right to something that's the unique property of another person.The Founders said you have a right to your life because God gives that uniquely to an individual. You see, you have a right to liberty because God gives you just one life and you can go choose a career of your choosing. Nobody else chooses your career. You get to do it yourself. But it doesn't say you own somebody else's career and should tell them what they should do with their life. That's what the Soviet Union thought.So our system was based on freedom, was based on limited government; limited in the sense that it was the job of government to protect just those basic rights that God gives to all men. And we have been setting aside that formula that works, instead trying to adopt something that the Europeans have never made work, and, of course, it never worked in the Soviet Union. We're going in the wrong direction, and we need to go back toward freedom.I didn't mean to get on too long a dissertation, but those distinctions between equal before the law as opposed to special deals, that's a very big part of what we're dealing with, Congressman.,2015-03-17 19:11:17.783508,2015-03-17 19:11:17.783508,House,AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE WORLD,2009-11-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-11-18/html/CREC-2009-11-18-pt1-PgH13257.htm,171,4,155,H13257-H13264,A000358,mr. akin
2797,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, in today's global economy, continued progress in math, science, and engineering, and the transfer of this knowledge, is vital if the U.S. is to maintain its competitiveness and keep good-paying, cutting-edge jobs here at home. New products, processes, industries and future employment opportunities depend on the advances in research and their movement into the marketplace.Missouri is a leader in a field of science that hardly existed 20 years ago--biotechnology. And I want Missouri to continue to be a leader in producing the best math and science minds in the country. How do we do that? One of our toughest educational challenges is helping our young people perform better in science and math.We know that America's fourth graders and eighth graders are performing above the international average in math and science. But when they get to high school, they fall behind.We need to do more. That is why I am pleased to support the America COMPETES Act, which strengthens educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school, with a particular focus on math and science teachers. In addition, this bill makes a bold Federal investment in basic science research at the National Science Foundation, the DOE Office of Science, NASA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.As many of you know, I have been a strong supporter of NSF over the years. NSF plays a critical role in the economic, scientific and intellectual growth of this Nation. It is one of our primary tools in meeting the global challenges of the 21st century by pushing the boundaries of scientific research and technology. NSF's work will give us a better insight into the world around us. This work will grow our economy and speed innovation, improving the quality of life for all people.NSF's impact over the past half century has been monumental, especially in the field of medical technologies and research. The investments have also spawned not only new products, but also entire industries, such as biotechnology, Internet providers, e-commerce, and geographic information systems. Medical technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, digital mammography and genomic mapping could not have occurred, and cannot now improve to the next level of proficiency, without underlying knowledge from NSF-supported work in biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences.New NSF support for research in nanotechnology, high-speed computing, plant genome research, biocomplexity, and cognitive neuroscience will further advance the state of technological change and improve our quality of life through creation of new products, a better understanding of how humans behave, and how our ecological systems can survive.Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not always adequately supported NSF and the physical sciences with the dollars it deserves. While the Congress and the current and past Administration has strongly supported the life sciences, the physical sciences have been left behind. This has resulted in a major funding disparity between the life sciences and the physical sciences. This funding imbalance is alarming because it directly jeopardizes our Nation's ability to lead the world in scientific innovation. Further, we jeopardize the work of the National Institutes of Health because we are undermining the physical sciences, which provide the underpinning for medical technological advances.Inadequate funding for NSF also hurts our economy and the creation of good jobs. In recent years, there has been an outcry of outsourcing jobs to other countries. And, our high-tech industry has been struggling to fill high-tech positions with American born workers. The best remedy to this issue is not protectionism but investing in the education and skills of our future workforce. This means better math and science education and technological skills, such as computer literacy. This is also a major part of NSF's mission.My good friend Senator Barbara Mikulski and I, along with many of my other colleagues, were pioneers in the fight to double the funding of NSF. Thanks to this effort we increased funding for NSF significantly; however, we fell short of our goal to double funding. The bill before us today provides an important opportunity to refocus attention on this critical goal and I am pleased that this bill puts us on the path to double NSF funding. It is critical that doubling funding for NSF remain one of our highest priorities and as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I hope we can do our part.Future job and economic growth in the areas of health care, life sciences, defense, agriculture and transportation is directly related to scientific advancement. For these reasons it is important to support the America COMPETES Act and make an important investment in the economic security and growth of our country.,2015-03-17 19:11:17.934592,2015-03-17 19:11:17.934592,Senate,AMERICA COMPETES ACT,2007-04-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-04-25/html/CREC-2007-04-25-pt1-PgS5020.htm,67,146,153,S5020-S5057,B000611,mr. bond
2798,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize the immeasurable contribution Dr. James T. Cassidy has made to pediatric medicine in Missouri and across the United States.Born in 1930 in Oil City, PA, Dr. Cassidy received his both undergraduate and medical education at the University of Michigan. He completed 2 years of active duty in the U.S. Navy and 7 years in the Naval Reserve. He returned to the University of Michigan to complete his residency in internal medicine and a rheumatology fellowship in the Rackham Arthritis Research Unit under the mentorship of Dr. Roseman and Dr. Johnson. He went on to the faculty in 1963 and worked his way up the ranks becoming professor of internal medicine and pediatrics in 1974. In 1984, he was recruited as professor and chair of pediatrics at Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, NE. Four years later he came to the University of Missouri-Columbia as a professor in the Department of Child Health and Internal Medicine and chief of pediatric rheumatology. He became emeritus professor in 1996 and continued to staff his arthritis clinics until this year. In 1991, Dr. Cassidy published with Ross Petty, M.D., the first ``Textbook of Pediatric Rheumatology,'' a textbook now in its fifth edition which remains the foremost authority in the field both nationally and internationally. He has received many awards, including ACR Master and the ACR Distinguished Clinical Scholar Award from the American College of Rheumatology.I am particularly proud of his work in Missouri. As a professor in the Department of Child Health and Internal Medicine at the University of Missouri-Columbia, Dr. Cassidy has inspired cutting-edge research and shared his limitless expertise in pediatric rheumatology. Yet Dr. Cassidy has done more than just teach, write, and research. Through his efforts, the Missouri Department of Health established the Juvenile Arthritis Care Coordination Program in 1993 to help families obtain family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children diagnosed with juvenile arthritis. His efforts did not stop there.Realizing that there were children in Southern Missouri who were too poor or too sick to travel to Columbia to receive treatment, Dr. Cassidy and his wife Nan would get in their car every other week and drive to a small clinic in Springfield, MO, and see as many as 25 young children suffering from juvenile arthritis. It didn't matter that they couldn't pay, Dr. Cassidy insisted on finding a way to get the children the treatments they needed. As one doctor said, ``Dr. Cassidy will go to any length to help a child.''Dr. Cassidy's support extended to his patients' families as well. ``He is an incredibly compassionate physician,'' said one mother, ``who ensures that each family understands how juvenile arthritis affects their child and what parents can do to help their child lead normal and healthy lives.'' Dr. Cassidy was instrumental in building a community of support across Missouri and the United States for families living with juvenile arthritis. In 1980, it was through the encouragement and support of Dr. Cassidy that a mother of one of his patients and two other mothers from other States formed the American Juvenile Arthritis Organization, AJAO, which eventually became a council of the Arthritis Foundation.Dr. Cassidy was instrumental in organizing the first juvenile arthritis educational conference for parents, children, and health professionals held in 1983 which became an annual national conference. He felt education for families of children with arthritis was critical to their care and helped coordinate many Missouri regional conferences in St. Joseph, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Columbia.Perhaps the best measure of Dr. Cassidy's legacy as a doctor comes from the praise and admiration of his patients. Twelve years ago, Dr. Cassidy began treating two young sisters who suffered debilitating pain from juvenile arthritis. Throughout the years he persistently encouraged them, to their chagrin, to wear braces and take their medicine. Recently, Dr. Cassidy received a letter from the girls. They are starting college as healthy, happy, young women--a circumstance virtually unthinkable when Dr. Cassidy began his career. They thanked him for supporting them and giving them the opportunity to live life as they never thought they could.Dr. Cassidy has led an extraordinary life in which he has practiced, researched, and guided aspiring doctors for almost 50 years. He has improved the understanding and awareness of pediatric rheumatology and changed the lives of thousands of children. On behalf of the children and families in Missouri and across the country, is my pleasure and honor to commemorate the distinguished career of Dr. Cassidy, a true pioneer in the field of pediatric rheumatology. ,2015-03-17 19:11:18.064685,2015-03-17 19:11:18.064685,Senate,TRIBUTE TO JAMES T.

2799,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor National Women's History Month. The National Women's History Project was founded in 1980 and is a non-profit educational organization committed to recognizing and celebrating the diverse and significant historical accomplishments of women. The legacy of others who shaped society inspires one's own longings to contribute. For young women, role models can inspire their sense of what is possible. Knowledge of women's strengths and contributions builds respect and nourishes self esteem.During Women's History Month, our nation celebrates the many accomplishments of women. Women are leaders in business, government, law, science, medicine, the arts, education, and many other fields. As bosses, mothers, sisters, daughters, wives and friends, they bring compassion and integrity to our work spaces and community settings and teach our children the values that make our country great.Thousands of outstanding Kansas City women have left their mark on our community by blazing new trails; by being the first woman to make a significant contribution in the greater metropolitan area. A beloved woman in Kansas City, known as the matriarch, is the late Lucille Bluford. Always a voice of conscience and reason, a woman of influence and great moral character, she began her career in 1930 as a reporter for The Kansas City Call. After owner Chester A. Franklin died in 1955, Ms. Bluford became managing editor, publisher and the first woman owner of a newspaper in the community. Her leadership, guidance and direction raised the consciousness of the African American community to the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s and 70s and rallied the readers to call for political action. In 1990, the University of Kansas awarded her it's Distinguished Service Citation, the highest honor to be bestowed upon a KU graduate for service to humanity. She was the second African American student to major in journalism at KU. Among her many countless awards, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Missouri, which years earlier denied her admission. In 1939, she bravely sued MU, but lost the case. While she may have lost that battle, her action prompted a series of legal challenges that ultimately led to the abolishment of the ``separate but equal'' doctrine in education.Ms. Bluford's career accomplishments opened doors for another female entrepreneur in journalism, Clara Reyes, who started Kansas City's first bilingual newspaper, Dos Mundos, in 1981 in her basement. She had sold real estate to people from different countries who often asked where to find bilingual professionals. Reyes took it upon herself to fill the void. She did not know much about the publishing world, but thought that if she could sell real estate, she could surely sell advertising.For more than 20 years, Clara Reyes has been a strong voice in the Hispanic community who wrote about issues important to Latinos in the Greater Kansas City area. Clara Reyes has helped ``Dos Mundos'' grow to become one of the leading bilingual newspapers in the Midwest dedicated to serving the community through daily news and information.Martha W. Gilliland, Ph.D., Chancellor of the University of Missouri-Kansas City holds a doctorate in environmental engineering/systems ecology from the University of Florida. On August 30, 2002, she received a prestigious national honor from the Policy Studies Organization: ``Top Public Policy Practitioner.''Under her leadership, UMKC, has established a progressive and ambitious agenda for the urban campus of 14,000 students. Chancellor Gilliland and her leadership team are poised to transform UMKC into a 21st century institution and a national model in scholarships and creative activity by attracting and nurturing responsive community leaders while providing the resources to achieve the University's vision of creating a vibrant environment of learning and campus life experience.Today, the vision of these Kansas City women: Lucille Bluford, Clara Reyes and Martha Gilliland, inspire women in our community to blaze new trails and seek their dreams.Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring National Women's History Month, as we celebrate the many ways women strengthen and enrich America. Their lives and work provide guideposts of hope for our future and for our children, and remind us all of what the human spirit can achieve when our collective eyes are fixed upon helping reach our greatest potential. I salute them one and all in honor of National Women's History Month.,2015-03-17 19:11:18.224793,2015-03-17 19:11:18.224793,Extensions,HONORING NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH,2004-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-31/html/CREC-2004-03-31-pt1-PgE496-3.htm,43,0,150,E496-E497,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2800,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 34, a sense of the Congress encouraging health insurance companies to take a more proactive role in promoting physical activity that prevents stroke, high blood pressure, and other life-threatening diseases.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services acknowledges that $270 billion in health care costs are caused by preventable diseases, including $180 billion for heart disease alone. Research by the Harvard School of Public Health noted that the closest thing to a magic bullet for treating this epidemic is exercise. It is estimated that if the more than 88 million inactive adults in the United States began regular exercise, national medical costs would decrease by more than $76 billion each year.According to the Department of Health and Human Services, two-thirds of all deaths in the United States are caused by obesity, a disease that increases the risk of illness for more than 30 medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes.Sixty-one percent of American adults are above their target weight, and 9 million school children are overweight, a figure that has tripled since 1980. A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that walking and bicycling among children age 5 to 15 dropped 40 percent between 1977 and 1995, and school budget constraints have led to the suspension of physical education classes across America.In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared obesity the most important public health issue facing the United States. As Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted in a recent report on childhood obesity, ``Obesity is a personal issue, but at the same time, families, communities and corporations all are adversely affected by obesity, and all bear responsibility for changing social norms to better promote healthier lifestyles.'' Children and teenagers are contracting diabetes at a rapidly increasing pace. Dr. Kenneth Cooper, one of the Nation's foremost experts on physical activity, noted, ``We may have the first generation in which parents will outlive their kids,'' referring to the reduced life expectancy of children who develop diabetes before age 14.The measure before us today expresses the sense of Congress that health insurance companies can do more to encourage healthier, more active lifestyles and urges them to consider incentives for those who choose to exercise regularly. I applaud the insurance providers and companies who already recognize the benefits of a healthy public, as does this resolution. These insurers offer incentives for getting active. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, for example, offers a free Walking Works program to employees and policyholders. In addition to helping plan a daily walking routine, Walking Works provides discounts on walking shoes and pedometers. Cigna offers discounts on subscriptions to health-related magazines, and Aetna provides discounts for home exercise equipment. Kaiser Permanente and Aetna here in Washington offer dues reductions of up to 60 percent at more than 90 area gyms. Obese Americans who take drastic, expensive action to lose weight under a doctor's orders are currently able to lighten their Federal tax load.The Surgeon General recommends daily exercise consisting of 30 minutes of walking or the equivalent, but 75 percent of Americans fail to meet this standard. A recent Harvard study found that, among healthy people, exercise can raise levels of HDL, known as good cholesterol, which improves clotting factors, lowers blood pressure and decreases inflammation. The study found that there is nothing else that has stronger and quicker effects than physical activity for preventing diabetes. Exercise can change virtually every tissue in the body. A German study comparing exercise and Viagra in treating erectile dysfunction found that an exercise regimen consisting of squatting exercises and pelvic and leg lifts is more effective in treating the condition than medication.Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson has called the current policies of insurance companies ``wrongheaded'' for not doing more to encourage people to stay healthy to prevent expensive illnesses. H. Con. Res. 34 commends Secretary Thompson for his efforts to promote incentives for Americans to lead an active life. Just two weekends ago, Secretary Thompson, along with Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Education Secretary Rod Paige and Surgeon General Richard Carmona, fanned out across our country announcing healthier U.S. grants. The Federal funds will aid in disease prevention or management programs, many aimed at promoting exercise, like an afterschool health club pilot program for children at risk for asthma, diabetes and obesity, and that is going to Philadelphia.I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) of the Committee on Energy and Commerce for his kind remarks and help in this effort along with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), my cosponsors from both sides of the aisle like the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Ryun) who spoke on behalf of this measure earlier in the day, and more than 20 organizations including the American Heart Association and the YMCA that support H. Con. Res. 34. I urge the House to adopt this measure and continue fiscally responsible policies to reduce the billions in health care costs currently spent on preventable diseases.,2015-03-17 19:11:18.390917,2015-03-17 19:11:18.390917,House,EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD TAKE A PROACTIVE ROLE IN PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES,2004-10-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-10-05/html/CREC-2004-10-05-pt1-PgH8091.htm,124,11,150,H8091-H8094,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2801,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I wish today to recognize three outstanding young women from my community, and the ongoing efforts of the Lyric Opera of Kansas City to heighten the awareness of the importance of art and culture by sponsoring dozens of programs for young people. Katherine Lorenz, Rebecca Mozley, and Amber Woodward were the three regional finalists chosen to participate in the 2000-2001 Texaco Quiz Kids Program at Kansas City, Missouri's historic Lyric Opera.The Texaco Quiz Kids Program is a distinguished nationwide competition that brings together talented youth performing arts scholars from six regions of North America. Students take part in a rigorous quiz show format in which they are tested upon their knowledge and understanding of selected operas that they have studied in depth. At the regional round their expertise was called upon to interpret ``Aida,'' ``Carmen,'' and ``The Magic Flute.''All three of the young women chosen to represent the Greater Kansas City Area have demonstrated exceptional musical scholarship and dedication to the appreciation of the performing arts. During the regional finals, each of these young scholars demonstrated a comprehensive understanding and knowledge of legendary operas from the 19th Century. Each of their loves for the performing arts radiated from their impressive answers. They are representatives of the best our community has to offer.Katherine is a senior at Lawrence High School who is involved in a number of organizations. She is Co-Vice President of the FYI Club, Treasurer of the Key Club, and is also an active member of the French Club, National Honor Society, and the cultural heritage panel. She is a teacher's aide for AP European history this year and sings with the Concert Choir. She played basketball through her sophomore year, and is an avid basketball fan. Katherine has studied piano for nine years with Eric Sakamura, and is currently a lesson assistant at Lawrence Piano Studio. Katherine is a National Merit Semifinalist who will begin college this fall, who hopes to major in History, French, and Music.Rebecca Mozley is a senior at Raytown South High School. Rebecca loves to sing. She has been a member of Raytown South's Cardinal Choral her junior and senior years and has also sung in the Kansas City All District Choir both years. She is a 2-year member of the National Honor Society, Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD), and Future Teachers of America. This year she is President of SADD and is the cadet teacher for the Concert Choir Class. She is maintaining a 3.8+ GPA and plays the flute and French horn in the school band. Rebecca is also involved in church activities. She plays a handbell in the choir and sings in the teen choir. She also works in the nursery. Through her church, Rebecca has had the opportunity to go on mission trips to different parts of the country to paint and repair homes in low-income neighborhoods for the past four summers. At present, her plans are to attend Central Missouri State University next fall and major in either music education or elementary education.Amber Woodward is a dedicated student who is maintaining a 4.3 GPA while taking all honors courses in her freshman year at Blue Valley North High School in Overland Park, Kansas. Throughout her academic career she has won numerous good citizen and student awards. Through her participation in musical theater she has contributed time and effort to many charities. Amber has a love for the performing arts. She studies voice, dance, acting, and plays the clarinet and piano. Amber's devotion to the performing arts has led her to a detailed study of Opera. Amber is a coloratura soprano and hopes someday to pursue a career in Opera.It is an honor for me to recognize Katherine, Rebecca, and Amber on this notable accomplishment. I wish all three of these young women continued success in all of their personal and academic endeavors. Each of the two semi-finalists received $500 scholarships from Texaco. During Round II in Kansas City, Katherine Lorenz was selected to represent our region in the final round in Toronto at Canadian Broadcasting Center next month.Mr. Speaker please join me in congratulating Kansas City's 2000-2001 Texaco Quiz Kids, Katherine Lorenz, Rebecca Mozley, and Amber Woodward. Also Mr. Speaker, please join me in saluting the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, Texaco, and each of these student's dedicated teachers: Cathy Crispino, Mary Bodney, and Judy Bowser for investing in our youth to help instill the heritage and value which the performing arts have played in shaping our society.,2015-03-17 19:11:18.546027,2015-03-17 19:11:18.546027,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO TEXACO QUIZ KIDS,2001-01-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-01-31/html/CREC-2001-01-31-pt1-PgE77-4.htm,13,0,147,E77-E78,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2802,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask Members to vote against this estate tax bill, and I ask Members to vote for the Democratic alternative that will be sponsored by the gentleman from New York.I firmly believe that we should cut estate taxes for family farms, for small businesses, and for very wealthy individuals. I think we have the only bill that achieves this goal in a sensible and responsible and evenhanded way. Our bill eliminates taxes for individuals with estates worth more than $2 million, and couples worth more than $4 million. We exempt 99 percent of all farms. As the Wall Street Journal reported today, we give more relief, relief to estates valued at less than $10 million through the year 2008. I quote from the article: ``An estate tax plan by Democrats offers speedier relief than the Republican proposal.''The Republican bill does not repeal the estate tax for another 10 years and hides the true cost of this tax cut. It is a gimmick. This is not an honest tax cut. It is an attempt to white out the cost and keep the numbers down so they can continue to argue that their tax cut is reasonable when the exact opposite is true.This bill creates loopholes that people will use to evade income taxes. It is tilted to the top 374 estates in America, and it is so unreasonable, given the other needs in our country and our budget, that many Americans who stand to make the most from the Republican bill do not even support it. The best off in our society have formed a coalition against this Republican proposal. Bill Gates, Sr., Warren Buffett, George Soros and many others have said, do not give us this big tax cut. We do not want a huge windfall. We can afford to pay a reasonable estate tax. We recognize that America is a community, and people who have profited the most, in their view, have a responsibility to give something back.This is a message of fiscal responsibility, discipline, moderation, and we support it. Today we hit the $2 trillion mark. In less than 3 months, the House of Representatives has passed $2 trillion in tax cuts, including interest. It is so much money, it makes one's head spin. It busts the budget. It gobbles up the available surplus, raids Medicare and Social Security, crowds out all kinds of other priorities.We will not be able to make the necessary investment in education if we want to give all of our children a first-rate, excellent public education, if we really want to leave no child behind. We will not have the resources to hire more teachers, build more classrooms, create more preschool and after-school programs. We will not have an affordable Medicare prescription drug program. We will not be able to extend the solvency of Medicare and Social Security so it will be there 9 years from now when the baby boomers start coming to ask legitimately for their benefits that they have been paying taxes for years to support.Now, let me finally say that when we add up these three, we are at $2 trillion. I am told there are more coming, and we are going to get to $3 trillion. I will say one more time for anybody that will listen that what we are doing here is something we did in 1981, and it took us 15 years to correct the problem.At the time, in the early 1980s, there was a book written by a man by the name of David Stockman called The Triumph of Politics. He was the OMB Director for Ronald Reagan. He served in this body. And the gist of this book is that the mistakes that were made in the early 1980s were very hard to correct and caused immeasurable economic difficulty in this country.I read from the end of his conclusion in this book at page 394. He is arguing at the end of the book for a tax increase to solve the fiscal problems that we faced. He said, ``In a way, the big tax increase we need will confirm the triumph of politics. But in a democracy, politicians must have the last word once it is clear their course is consistent with the preferences of the electorate.'' He said, ``The abortive Reagan revolution proved that the American electorate wants a moderate social democracy to shield it from capitalism's rougher edges. Recognition of this in the Oval Office,'' he said, ``is all that stands between a tolerable economic future and one fraught with unprecedented perils.''I quote David Stockman to this House of Representatives. If we do not learn from history, we are forced to repeat it. This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. One can break the tax cut into parts, but one cannot break its effect on the overall deficit and the overall economic policy of this country. We should not make this mistake. We made it before. We do not need to do it again.We talk about responsibility. We need every citizen in this country to be responsible. But if we expect the people of this country to be responsible, we as the leaders of this country need to be responsible.Mr. Speaker, enacting this tax cut, along with all the others, is totally irresponsible and should not stand. I beg Members to vote against this proposal and vote for the Democratic proposal, which is responsible, is fair, and is consistent with a low deficit, fiscally responsible policy for this country.,2015-03-17 19:11:18.802203,2015-03-17 19:11:18.802203,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 8, DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT OF 2001,2001-04-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-04-04/html/CREC-2001-04-04-pt1-PgH1416.htm,48,45,147,H1416-H1424,G000132,mr. gephardt
2803,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Madam Speaker, I want to join with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my good friend, to talk about the global food for our education bill, and also to thank the gentleman for doing such a tremendous job in leading the charge forward on this particular legislation that I think is so very, very important for all of the children in the world who have no means to get a nutritional meal, and also because of the importance that it will mean for our farmers in America who are now suffering from the fourth year of low commodity prices, whose revenues will probably decrease in the neighborhood of about $4 billion this year.This legislation, quite frankly, is a win-win for the American farmer, and it is a win-win for children all over the world who desperately need food assistance and who need an education.Madam Speaker, I am particularly excited and motivated by the vision of former Senator and now Ambassador George McGovern and former Senator Bob Dole who really led the charge early in this fight against hunger, back many years ago when they were both serving in the Senate.It is also a very important issue for members of my family, because my late husband Bill was so very instrumental in bringing the issue of hunger, both domestically and internationally, into the Congress and worked so closely with his friend, the late Mickey Leland, as well as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf).I know that we all share a common desire to try to help as many people as we can all over the world, and I am particularly hopeful that we will be successful in passing this legislation as a stand-alone, but if not, hopefully it will be part of the next farm bill as it is written.I cannot think of anything that is more important for us to do as a country. I think Senator McGovern probably said it best when he said we had a moral responsibility as a country with our rich and valuable natural resources and our abundant and very safe food supply to help people who cannot help themselves.And I say to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), that the gentleman has done a magnificent job in getting our colleagues to be very excited about this, to be enthusiastic, and I am so very pleased also that the United States Senate is participating as well with their bill.Madam Speaker, let me say that from an agricultural standpoint, there are many, many benefits for the United States economy for international food assistance. We have done this for many, many years as a country. I am very hopeful that this will be a policy that we perpetuate, that we are able to get the rest of the world involved in, but, most importantly, this kind of foreign assistance.U.S. food aid helps alleviate poverty. It promotes economic growth to the recipient countries, and this is very, very important, because as incomes in developing countries rise, then we know that consumption patterns change, and we also know that food and other imports of U.S. goods and services increase.In fact, back in 1996, 9 of the top 10 agricultural importers of U.S. products were food aid recipients. While we are shipping food aid abroad, it is important for people to understand that most of the money stays in the United States.The domestic beneficiaries of U.S. food aid exports include our agricultural producers and suppliers, our processors, our millers, edible oil refiners, packaging, manufacturing, rail and motor transportation lines; I could go on and on and on. Most every State in the country does benefit from food aid exports, in spite of the fact that most people would not knowingly think that they were agricultural States.I think that we must do everything possible to help the world's hungry children. When my late husband Bill came back from a trip in the Sudan, when he came back from various trips to Ethiopia and other countries, it was a very, very sad experience. He would hold dying children in his arms, children who were 12 years old and 13 years old, who were about the size of a 3-year-old or 4-year-old, who did not weigh anything, who had no opportunity to go to school.Mr. Speaker, I just want to say in closing, then, that I hope that more people will help all of us help children all over the world, as well as the American farmer.,2015-03-17 19:11:18.961317,2015-03-17 19:11:18.961317,House,THE GEORGE McGOVERN-ROBERT DOLE INTERNATIONAL FOOD FOR EDUCATION AND CHILD NUTRITION ACT OF 2001,2001-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-09/html/CREC-2001-05-09-pt1-PgH2062.htm,63,1,147,H2062,E000172,mrs. emerson
2804,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my comments and warmest congratulations on the retirement of my friend, Wayman F. Smith III, who is leaving his position as Vice President of Corporate Affairs for the Anheuser Busch Corporation after 20 years of dedicated service. Throughout his life, Wayman Smith has remained a committed public servant who has made it his life's work to expand opportunity and raise the aspirations of African Americans in both his native St. Louis and our country as a whole.As a young man during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, Wayman made the dangerous journey through the segregated South to help register African American voters as part of the NAACP Voter Registration Project. Later in the Sixties, Wayman entered the political arena and was elected to the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, where he served for twelve years. He also served four years on the Board of Police Commissioners for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.Wayman Smith began his high school years in the 1950s at the segregated Summer High School in St. Louis, but later transferred to and graduated from Soldan High School following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education. After completing his undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey, Wayman later went on to earn his Juris Doctorate degree from Howard University School of Law. Following his graduation from law school, Wayman became a partner in the law firm of Wilson, Smith, McCullin and Smith and later served as a judge in the St. Louis Metropolitan Court and served as the director of the Conciliation for the Missouri Commission on Human Rights.During the last twenty years, Wayman has served as Vice President of Corporate Affairs for the Anheuser Busch Corporation, where he has been credited with building positive and economically productive relationships between Anheuser Busch and the African American community. Under Wayman's leadership, Anheuser Busch's Corporate Affairs Department expanded its Minority Purchasing Program initiative from less than $1 million to nearly $200 million. As a result, the Anheuser Busch Corporation today holds the honorable distinction of having done business with every African American, Hispanic and women-owned financial institution in the nation.Additionally, his department has raised over $160 million for the United Negro College Fund and he founded the ``Budweiser Jammin' for Education Fund'' a major provider of college scholarship funds for our nation's urban youth. Literally hundreds of organizations have benefited greatly from Wayman's assistance, including the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which received a direct contribution from Wayman Smith to help pay off the mortgage on its Washington, D.C. headquarters.In addition to his professional responsibilities, Wayman Smith has always been a leader in community involvement. He founded and chairs the African American Initiative for the United Way: a program that has raised millions of dollars for worthwhile charities in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area. Wayman is also Chairman of the Board of Regents for one of our nation's historically black educational institutions, Harris-Stowe State College, and serves on the Howard University Board of Trustees where he is also Chairman Emeritus. Wayman Smith also participates on the boards of the St. Louis Gateway Classic Foundation, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Rankin Technical College, the NAACP Special Contributions Fund, and the United Way of Greater St. Louis.Now after twenty years at the corporate helm, Wayman plans to enjoy his early retirement from Anheuser Busch by returning to his first love, private legal practice. This summer, Wayman will rejoin his brother, Christopher M. Smith, Sr. and six other attorneys in the Smith Partnership in St. Louis, where he will continue to represent Anheuser Busch as well as other national and international interests.It is my pleasure and honor to recognize Wayman F. Smith III, for the many contributions he has made on behalf of his beloved City of St. Louis, his community and his nation.,2015-03-17 19:11:19.147477,2015-03-17 19:11:19.147477,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO WAYMAN F.

2805,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the marriage tax relief bill. You could characterize it as tax relief or you could characterize it, I suppose, as a tax cut. But the true characterization is one that Senator Hutchison has over and over emphasized: This is tax correction. The bill is intended to correct the Tax Code. The code needs correction because it is an assault on the very values of our culture.There is a fundamental unfairness when the Tax Code is at war with our values and penalizes a basic social institution such as the institution of marriage. The American people know this. They understand it is not right to have a Tax Code that penalizes marriage. The vast majority of the Members of this body understand this. This last week, during consideration of the budget resolution, the Senate voted 99-1 on the Hutchison amendment to support marriage tax relief. In other words, let's abandon the policy of punishing married people who pay higher taxes in the Tax Code.Despite this overwhelming vote less than 10 days ago, some of my colleagues are now trying to stop or to delay the marriage tax relief measure by demanding nonrelevant amendments. Yesterday, several Senators from the other side of the aisle spoke on the floor and agreed there is unfairness in the Tax Code and that it is fundamentally unfair to tax people only because they marry. However, these same Senators then said the Finance Committee bill gives tax cuts to people who do not need them. That seems an arrogant statement to me, to suppose Government knows best how to spend the people's money. In addition, one Senator opposed the finance bill, asking, how many of these tax cuts can we afford to give away?I submit, the real question is, how much of the hard-earned money can families afford to have taken away by an unfair system which penalizes men and women, a schoolteacher, a fireman, for getting married and beginning a family? How much longer will we continue to allow married couples to be penalized just for getting married?We are here to correct that fundamental unfairness. It is something that has grown up in the code. It is like a weed which is taking over the garden. Good things are prevented by its presence. We ought to pull it out and make sure we have a Tax Code that does not make it harder for young people to be married and have a family.Are we for correcting this unfairness? Are we against it? Or are we just saying that we are? One cannot say they oppose this penalty and then fight to take the relief away that is provided in the bill. Our colleagues in the House have already demonstrated dramatically that they back a correction for this injustice.In February, the House passed the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000. Thanks to the good work of the Senate Finance Committee, under the direction of Senator Roth, we have a measure which will help substantially lessen the burden of this penalty that has been laid upon the families of America.This bill makes great strides in providing relief and correcting this injustice. Twenty-five million American couples pay an average of $1,400 a year extra simply because they are married. Ending the penalty will give couples the freedom to make the choices they ought to make: The choice to be married and have a durable, lasting relationship of marriage as the foundation for the family unit.The marriage tax penalty forces some Americans to make compromises instead of real choices. Mothers and fathers should be able to choose whether both parents will be employed outside the home based on what is in the family's best interest, or whether there should be a nonworking spouse who stays in the home. The Senate bill respects the value of the contribution of the spouse who stays home, and that is very important. Our Tax Code should respect the value that is added to the equation by a stay-at-home spouse who makes the family a stronger unit and builds for this country the kind of integrity that strong families provide.In conclusion, no one has ever devised or developed or even dreamed of a better department of education, social services, a better department of health, education, and welfare than the family, and it is time for our Tax Code.,2015-03-17 19:11:19.301565,2015-03-17 19:11:19.301565,Senate,MARRIAGE TAX RELIEF,2000-04-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-04-13/html/CREC-2000-04-13-pt1-PgS2664.htm,47,0,146,S2664-S2665,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2806,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the President's veto, a veto that speaks volumes about the differences that divide us, about our competing agendas.This weekend I was back home in my district in St. Louis; and I went door to door, as I always do, and I heard from the working families who live in my district. In all the many conversations I had with my constituents, I did not get one question about what we were going to do to get rid of the estate tax. I did not hear one soul tell me to wipe out taxes for the wealthiest 2 percent of the American people.The people in my district, like I expect the people in my colleagues' districts, are not interested in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They are not interested in going back to the Reagan years, the Bush years of red ink and large deficits and high interest rates and high inflation and high unemployment.Let me tell my colleagues what the people did talk about. They talked about when we are going to get a prescription medicine program for senior citizens in Medicare. They talked about getting protections from HMOs and insurance companies, so that, God forbid, the doctors and nurses were making important medical decisions and not accountants and HMO executives. They talked about education. They talked about school buildings. They talked about teachers. They talked about getting rid of guns in schools. They talked about Social Security and Medicare. They talked about paying down the national debt. They talked about doing something about middle-income tax relief.Please hear this, my colleagues. This bill is a bad bill. It is a reckless bill. It does absolutely nothing for 98 percent of the American people. Now, we proposed an alternative that would get something done if our friends would compromise. We said, let us give immediate relief to more than half the people with the smaller estates. We said, let us cut the estate tax immediately by 20 percent. We said that we can relieve 99 percent of all small businesses and family farmers from paying any estate tax.We could have done that months ago. We can do that today. The President would sign a bill that was our alternative, that would give people immediate needed relief from the estate tax. But we did not do that, because, I guess, we have to spend this precious time on the floor getting this veto sustained.This bill would give the largest 330 estates nationwide more than $10.5 million in tax cuts, on average, every year. These estates are valued at more than $20 million apiece and, meanwhile; 98 percent of our people would not see a dime in tax cuts. Add it up. When we add up all the figures, we are draining our surpluses. This bill in the second 10 years would cost over $750 billion.Let me finally say this. Last year, the Republicans sent us a trillion dollar tax cut. The President vetoed it. They did not even bring it back here for an override. So this year there was a better idea: let us cut it up into little sausage pieces and maybe we can fog one past the American people.People do not want to spend the majority of this surplus on tax cuts, and they sure do not want to spend it on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. They want us to pay down the national debt. They want us to take care of Social Security and Medicare. They want us to spend these last days that we have on the floor in this session doing prescription medicine for our senior citizens in the Medicare program, getting a patients' bill of rights, and doing something to have better school buildings and more teachers and better education. They want us to have a minimum wage increase. They do not want this bill.I urge Members to sustain the President's veto. Let us come back with the Democratic alternative. Let us get something done for the American people. Let us pay down the debt.,2015-03-17 19:11:19.458677,2015-03-17 19:11:19.458677,House,DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT OF 2000--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,2000-09-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-07/html/CREC-2000-09-07-pt1-PgH7322.htm,103,60,146,H7322-H7335,G000132,mr. gephardt
2807,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I thank the gentleman from Vermont for setting up this special order. I am happy to come to the floor today to make a few comments about this reimportation issue and other issues that I think are related to it.Let me first cite the fact that we have not passed in this Congress, and I believe we should have passed, an agenda that really puts families first; an agenda that is supported by the majority of our people; an agenda that includes a patients' bill of rights, which is desperately needed by many families; an agenda that includes reducing class size, as we spoke today on the education bills and hiring for teachers; an agenda that includes a real Medicare prescription medicine benefit, a benefit that will work, a benefit that will be there when people need it, that will make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans. That agenda, in my view, has been blocked in every way in the name of special interests.The patients' bill of rights, as far as I can tell, has been blocked to protect HMOs and insurance companies. The middle-class tax cuts have been blocked in the name of huge tax cuts to the wealthy. Debt reduction has been blocked in the same name, huge tax cuts for the wealthy. Minimum wage has been blocked as a favor to some businesses that do not want it. Education incentives to modernize our schools and hire new teachers has been blocked for other ideas for private schools. The Medicare drug benefit has been blocked at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry. We need an affordable, meaningful prescription benefit in the reliable world of Medicare, a benefit that guarantees our seniors will have benefits when they need them, and real relief on reducing the cost of drugs.The special interests have frankly stopped a reliable Medicare prescription medicine benefit. We have squandered every opportunity we have had in this Congress to get this done. But right now we have still in this Congress the ability to do something on price for all of our citizens, not just our senior citizens. I want to remind all of us that the reimportation issue has passed both Houses of the Congress. On the Medicare prescription medicine benefit, we did pass something here. It was not the right bill, but at least we passed something. Nothing has even been brought up or passed in the Senate. But on reimportation we have passed something in both Houses.What we passed in both Houses would lower the cost of drugs in the United States by between 30 and 50 percent. This is a dramatic reduction. It could affect every American family right now. It would allow the pharmaceutical industry to buy FDA-approved drugs abroad at reduced rates and consumers could realize the savings, at least with the Senate-passed version of this bill. And, remember, we probably could have passed that better version if the rules here had allowed us to do it, but it did not.But we have in the Senate, in conference, the right provision. It would mean that millions of seniors could buy drugs at a fraction of the current cost. It is sensible, it has bipartisan support in both bodies, it sailed through the Congress, and the American people are for it. It would help seniors and other citizens now, this year. Even the month after we would pass it, people could begin buying drugs at dramatically lower prices.Now, the reality is the leadership has not allowed this measure to go to conference. It is bottled up in the Ag conference committee. It is languishing. It should not be languishing. Now, what are we doing? Why are we waiting until adjournment comes and we cannot take this up? Why has the measure not gone to conference? Why are we not doing something about this?It seems to me, and I address this to the gentleman from Vermont, that we have in these remaining weeks the ability to get this up in conference, to decide this in favor of the Senate provision, which gives people the greatest reduction in price and allows companies to actually reimport these products into the United States and get a broader price reduction for more Americans. I would simply ask the gentleman, and the gentleman from New York, who has sponsored the only thing that he could in the House, which was very positive but not as good as he wanted it to be, what we can do in the remaining days to get this done for the American people?,2015-03-17 19:11:19.601777,2015-03-17 19:11:19.601777,House,DEMOCRATS' PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN BEST FOR AMERICA,2000-09-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-20/html/CREC-2000-09-20-pt1-PgH7909.htm,112,2,146,H7909-H7916,G000132,mr. gephardt
2808,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to keep the government running when the new fiscal year begins on Sunday. But I regret that we are forced to pass such a bill. We never should have reached this point.Instead of doing the important work of the American people, we have spent the last year bringing forward a series of massive tax cuts focused primarily on the wealthiest Americans. This Congress has spent most of the year debating tax cuts for the wealthiest that left no money for debt reduction, basic appropriations, or anything else.We saw this coming a long time ago. This chain of events was set in motion by the Republican-passed tax cuts. It was set in motion by a single-minded devotion, tax breaks for the wealthiest, that has overwhelmed and taken the place of the whole budget process. The result is that we have been unable to accomplish the bare minimum and pass the annual appropriations bills required by law, and still, even at this late hour, 11 of the 13 bills remain to be enacted.We have been prevented from passing a budget that addresses the needs of working families and keeps us on the path of fiscal discipline. And then, 3 weeks before the end of the session, after the Republican tax package did not fly, Republicans abandoned their strategy and shifted to portray themselves as the champions of debt reduction. But the new so-called 90-10 budget was no better than the old budget, because it was only for 1 year. It did not hold the promise of true debt reduction because it allowed Republicans to return next year or the year after and again pass huge tax cuts that would blow a hole in our surpluses.I wrote a letter to the Speaker asking him to come up with a new budget, a new framework, so that we could complete our work and move on with the business of the American people. I have not received a reply.Today, we have before us a stopgap bill that, of course, everyone should support. Nobody wants to repeat the government shutdown. But the issue before us is not just the leadership's inability to enact the critical appropriations bills. The issue is the larger failure of this Congress to act on an agenda that finally, at long last, puts families first; an agenda that I believe a majority of the American people want us to pursue:Tax cuts focused on middle class and working families; a Patients' Bill of Rights to enforceably protect patients from the accountants and HMOs; a real Medicare prescription benefit that guarantees seniors access to affordable medicines; funds dedicated to building new classrooms and hiring additional teachers, so we can finally reduce class size and give children the education they need and deserve; real debt reduction that pays off the debt entirely by 2012 and still leaves enough money for tax cuts for working families.My constituents and Americans throughout the country want us to pursue and realize this agenda. But this agenda has been blocked by special interests. It has been blocked by Republican leaders determined to not do this agenda.A meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights has been blocked to protect HMOs and insurance companies. Middle-class tax cuts were blocked in the name of huge tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. Real serious long-term debt reduction was blocked again in the name of huge tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. The minimum wage has been blocked as a favor to big business. And education incentives to modernize our schools and hire new teachers has been blocked in the name of partisan ideology which tears down schools and takes money from them rather than lifting them up. Hate crimes legislation is still not law, and we have not acted on Latino and immigrant fairness issues.We support strong reimportation of drug legislation with standards, because it will bring prescription prices down for millions of Americans. I am glad that the leadership has said they want to pass such legislation, but we should not let reimportation detract from the more important issue: a Medicare prescription benefit that will be there for seniors when they need it. That has been blocked by the pharmaceutical industry.So I call on our leaders to disassociate themselves from special interests and work with us on a bipartisan basis to accomplish something meaningful for a vast majority of Americans in the days that are left of this session. Let us work together on the issues the American people truly care about and achieve something real for them in the few days that are left.,2015-03-17 19:11:19.868968,2015-03-17 19:11:19.868968,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.

2809,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I'd like to take this opportunity to show my commitment and support to the children's health bill before us today. This comprehensive children's health legislation was cultivated out of several individual bills, including the Healthy Kids 2000 Act that I introduced last year with my colleague Senator Kit Bond. It was a tremendous pleasure working with Representatives Bilirakis and Brown in developing the first version of this comprehensive children's health legislation, and I applaud their dedication and commitment to seeing the important issue of children's health addressed this year.Specifically within this bill, there are three key components that I am especially proud of the conferees for including. The first provision is with respect to safe motherhood. Most Americans are surprised to learn that total maternal mortality has not declined in the United States since 1982. Between 1982 and 1996, the national maternal mortality ratio has remained approximately 7.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Additionally, the CDC estimates that of the 10,000 women who give birth in the United States every day: 2-3 women die from pregnancy-related conditions; 2,100 women experience major pregnancy related complications before labor; 2,500 women have Caesarean section delivery; 2,600 women experience severe labor-related complications.These rates of mortality and morbidity are simply unacceptable. Fortunately, with passage of the children's health bill today, the CDC will now have the ability and resources to increase surveillance research on maternal health issues, and also implement additional prevention and maternal health promotion programs nationwide.A second provision I was pleased to sponsor and support earlier this year with my colleague Representative Lucille Royball-Allard was the folic acid education initiative. This bill contains the authorization of a comprehensive national health education campaign promoting folic acid to prevent serious birth defects. In 1991, research proved that the B vitamin folic acid could prevent serious birth defects of the brain and spine, known as neural tube defects [NTDs]. Spina bifida and anencephaly are two common NTDs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has stated that if all American women of childbearing age consumed 400 micrograms of the B vitamin folic acid each day up to 70 percent of all cases of neural tube defects could be prevented.However, this scientific breakthrough has not been translated into a reduction in neural tube defects because millions of women are not aware of the role of folic acid in preventing NTDs. While public awareness is improving, a majority of women are uninformed about the benefits of folic acid and they are not consuming the recommended daily amount. According to a June 2000 March of Dimes national survey conducted by the Gallup Organizations, only 34 percent of women of childbearing age reported taking a multivitamin with folic acid on a daily basis. The survey also found that 9 out of 10 women do not know that folic acid must be consumed before pregnancy to be effective, and that only 1 in 7 know that folic acid prevents birth defects.This provision outlines the components of a comprehensive national campaign that would enable CDC to assist states and others to develop and implement programs to reduce the incidence of neural tube birth defects which effect an estimated 2,500 babies each year.Lastly, I want to take a moment to express my support for title XXII of the bill, which directs the National Institutes of Health to develop a more coordinated research strategy with regards to muscular dystrophy, giving particular attention to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. This form of the disease is the most common and most devastating of the muscular dystrophies. One in 3,500 male children born worldwide will be born with Duchenne and will lose the ability to walk by age 10; however, most children are diagnosed between the ages of two and three. Muscle deterioration will continue in the back and chest making it more and more difficult to breathe. The deterioration process will continue until it takes the life of a child some where in their late teens or early twenties. This is a process that no family should ever have to undergo, and I am happy to see that the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke has been challenged with the task of ensuring a stronger federal focus at NIH towards finding a cure and alternative treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I applaud and thank my colleagues for pushing NIH to take a more responsible role in finding a cure for this devastating disease, and for their commitment to ensuring passage of this important legislation impacting the lives of millions of children throughout the country.,2015-03-17 19:11:20.016066,2015-03-17 19:11:20.016066,House,CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000,2000-09-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-27/html/CREC-2000-09-27-pt1-PgH8206-6.htm,117,81,146,H8206-H8265,E000172,mrs. emerson
2810,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the $7 million increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) over the FY2000 budget. This much needed funding is included in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations bill before us today which I support.These additional funds will enable art education programs to flourish and continue to reduce youth violence and enhance youth development. If we are serious about curtailing youth violence, we must continue funding projects that achieve positive results. One such project, YouthArts, is a collaboration between the NEA, the Department of Justice and national and local arts agencies. This project is located in Portland, OR, Atlanta, GA and San Antonio, TX and has been successful in positive behavior change for the at risk youth participants. These adolescents have demonstrated improved communication, self-discipline, and intrapersonal skills, as well as a decreased frequency of delinquent behavior. For example, in Portland, communications skills in the YouthArts participants shot up from 43% at the beginning of the program to a full 100% by the end of the twelve weeks. Equally impressive, in San Antonio, 16.4% of participants had a decrease in delinquent behavior compared with 3.4% of their peers in a control group. It's obvious that the NEA and this program have the potential to inspire millions of America's youth across America to explore positive alternatives in their lives.In my district, NEA has successfully co-funded the Ailey Camp in Kansas City. Alvin Ailey is a national dance troupe which conducts a six week dance camp now in its eleventh year which has provided opportunities for more than 1,000 urban, disadvantaged middle schoolers in Kansas City. This camp provides a vehicle, through art, for children to acquire self esteem and enjoy the experience of success. In addition to dance, the camp also has creative writing, personal development, antiviolence and drug abuse programs. Statistics confirm the success of this program through improved behavior and learning by these at risk children.Art and music education programs extend back to the ancient Greeks who applied music when teaching math, for example. Current studies reaffirm that when music such as jazz is introduced by teachers into the classrooms, learning comes alive and improves math and verbal scores. A 1999 national report by the College Entrance Examination Board found that high school students with coursework in music performance and appreciation scored higher on SAT; 55 points higher on the verbal section and 40 points higher on the math section.The NEA also funds several programs at the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, the only museum of its kind in the country. Throughout the 1930's, Kansas City was known for its celebrated jazz music, and hosted music luminaries such as Count Basie and Charlie ``Bird'' Parker. NEA funding enables the museum to preserve and present jazz so that people from all over the city, the country, and the world may appreciate one of the first original American art forms.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in full support for increased funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. This support sends a message that art and music in the classroom and in the public sphere are valued and vital to a more creative and enriched future for all Americans. Mr. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4578, a bill making appropriations to the Department of Interior and Related Agencies for FY 2001. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Bill Young and Ranking Member Mr. David Obey of the Committee on Appropriations, and Chairman Ralph Regula and Ranking Member Mr. Norman Dicks of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations for their work on this important bill and for their support on issues affecting the territories.I thank the members of the appropriations committee and the subcommittee for their work to ensure that Guam received $10 million for Compact Impact Aid in this year's interior appropriations bill given Guam's continuing economic recovery from the Asian financial crisis and our unprecedented 15.3 percent unemployment rate. Increasing Compact Aid for Guam has been a priority as the responsibility of supporting an unfunded federal mandate has placed a heavy financial burden on the people of Guam.Also included in this legislation is the Lands Legacy Trust Fund which will provide $12 billion over the next six years to pay for land conservation, preservation and maintenance.

2811,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, overall I believe this is an excellent package that is badly needed by seniors, the disabled, hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers.Finally, we have already had a lot of discussion about the Pain Relief Promotion Act. Obviously it is controversial. The bill simply amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the use of federally regulated drugs to help his or her life.Let me be clear about that. Simply put, this would prevent any effort to assist in a suicide by using controlled substances such as powerful pain killers. The bill goes further in its efforts to provide appropriate relief to people suffering great pain. It provides a variety of provisions and educational programs to encourage appropriate pain relief. Indeed, under this legislation for the first time ever the Controlled Substances Act would explicitly recognize that aggressive pain relief is an appropriate and fully warranted use of controlled substances.I believe a vast majority of Americans share a simple belief--that I hold very strongly--that doctors we rely on to nurture and extend our lives should not be party to efforts actively to promote someone's death. The bill simply recognizes that consensus. It looks like we are going to have lots of discussion and have an opportunity to hear many different views on this legislation. But before we paint it as the most ugly duckling coming down the path, I thought my colleagues and those who may be watching or listening still at this late hour would like to know that there are some beautiful limbs and beautiful facets of this that are very important bipartisan measures.I hope we can pass this because there are many priorities that the President has asked for, that leaders on the Democratic side have asked for, and I believe our side wishes as well that are beneficial to a great number of American people who are waiting for our response.I thank the Chair. I apologize to my colleague from Nevada whom I misled into thinking that it was going to be a short set of remarks.Dear Representative Thomas: On behalf of the 5,000 members of the American Hospital Association (AHA), I am writing to express our views regarding the ``Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act of 2000'' (BIPA). We believe this legislation will take another step forward in addressing the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). Consequently, as we approach the remaining hours of the congressional session, we are urging Members to vote in favor of this legislation, and have recommended that the President not veto the legislation. As we understand the provisions of the legislation, it includes a number of provisions that provide much needed relief to hospitals and health systems throughout the country. Such provisions include: a full market basket inflationary update in FY2001, and elimination of half of the reduction in FY2002; temporary elimination of the reductions in Medicaid DSH state allocations in FY 2001 and 2002, and allow the program to grow with inflation in those years; increase the adjustment for Indirect Medical Education to 6.5% in 2001 and 6.375% in FY 2002, and establish an 85% national floor for direct Graduate Medical Education payments; equalize payments to rural hospitals under Medicare DSH; increased flexibility for critical access, sole community, and Medicare dependent hospitals; increased bad debt payments from 55% to 70% for all beneficiaries; and a full market basket update for outpatient hospital services. The bill will also provide relief to home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities. As our members operate approximately one-third of the home health agencies and one fourth of the skilled nursing facilities, relief in this area is also vitally necessary, and is an important feature in the bill. In addition, the bill includes important beneficiary protections, particularly the execrated reduction in beneficiary coinsurance for hospital outpatient services. At the same time, we are disappointed that certain provisions we have advocated, such a full market basket increase in FY2002 for both inpatient and outpatient hospital services, complete elimination of the impact of the BBA's reductions in Medicaid DSH, and maintaining the IME adjustment of 6.5% beyond FY 2001, were not included. We are also concerned that additional reductions in the hospital inpatient market basket in 2003 were included in the bill. We look forward to working with you in the next congress to achieve these additional changes. Again, we appreciate your efforts to achieve additional BBA relief this year. Sincerely, Rick Pollack, Executive Vice President.,2015-03-17 19:11:20.376322,2015-03-17 19:11:20.376322,Senate,H.R. 2614--CONFERENCE REPORT,2000-10-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-26/html/CREC-2000-10-26-pt2-PgS11107.htm,136,2,146,S11107-S11111,B000611,mr. bond
2812,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise to commend Senators Gorton and Frist for what I believe to be a very important step forward in providing the basis for educational achievement by students. Sometimes I think in all the debate we have about education, we get worried about one group of individuals who might manage funds here and one group who might manage funds there, and whether or not this would be directed by this group or that group. The ultimate objective of our program in education is student achievement. We want students to develop, as a result of our educational efforts, the capacity to grapple with the issues of the next century. We ought to ask ourselves on a regular basis, How is that best done? How do we elevate the capacity and the performance of the students? What is it that gets that done best?Well, I think this particular effort on the part of the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Tennessee recognizes two or three important principles in student achievement. First, nothing is more directly correlated to student achievement than parental involvement. The more influence we give to parents, to community leaders, and to the role models who are right around those students in shaping the students' opportunities, the more likely those students are to achieve. Study after study shows that when parents are involved, when schoolteachers and community officials are involved, when the culture around the student is involved in decisionmaking and they get active in the schools, that is when achievement goes up.Now, this block grant approach is going to move toward the parents, toward the communities, toward the students, toward the cultural leaders who surround the students, and give the right to make and the opportunity to make decisions that they believe will best motivate and enhance the capacity of students to achieve. It is very, very important.Second, I believe that it is very difficult to make intelligent decisions for the whole country under the rubric of a single prescription. There are a lot of health problems in the United States. But if we were to say we were going to prescribe a single wonder drug, I think people would wonder about it. They know they would like to be able to go to their doctor to decide what is wrong with them, what their problems are, and to get a prescription that would really make a difference to them. I think when we give the capacity to deploy resources to State and local school agencies and we don't tell them what sort of prescription there has to be but we allow them to use the resources to best achieve what is needed in that area, we provide the basis for student achievement for actually delivering through the educational process what it is we need to deliver.I visited a school in southwest Missouri just this last year. Both State and local governments had so many strings on what they said money could be used for that they could not do what needed to be done. They needed to build new classrooms. They were laboring under a requirement that they had to spend so much of the money for teacher's salaries. They wanted to be able to do teacher's salaries. But they first needed classes. Because it was a high growth area, they were trapped between needing to get the classrooms first, for which they could not spend the money, and having to spend the money for teachers. They couldn't use the teachers until they had the classrooms.We really need to free the people who care the most about America's future--they are parents, community leaders, school leaders, teachers, and administrators at the local level. We need to free them to be able to deploy resources effectively.There is a myth in Washington; that is, that we can make something where one size fits all. The truth of the matter is one size fits none.These amendments are fundamentally beneficial amendments which will help Americans develop and shape better schools for their children in which students achieve.I thank the Senator from Tennessee.,2015-03-17 19:11:20.702561,2015-03-17 19:11:20.702561,Senate,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS,1998-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-22/html/CREC-1998-04-22-pt1-PgS3375-5.htm,45,44,144,S3375-S3407,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2813,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker. Trailblazers are people who take chances and stand up for what's right, even when the status quo tells them the time is ``not right''. Trailblazers change the course of history, as Rev. Claude Heithaus did at Saint Louis University on a day in February 1944 when he delivered a sermon that led to integration in higher education in the city of St. Louis. As a proud alumnus of Saint Louis University and beneficiary of Rev. Heithaus' courageous actions, I commend to our colleagues the April 14, 1998 St. Louis Post Dispatch article, titled ``Priest led the fight for university integration'', which tells of the great sacrifice Rev. Heithaus made for the benefit of racial harmony. It is my hope that our colleagues in the struggle for racial equality and justice will find strength in this story.St. Louis is rich in history, and we honor those who have contributed to its history in a number of ways: by naming parks, streets, hospitals and schools after them, or by keeping their memory alive by dedicating a civic project or program to them. Yet an important figure in the history of our city continues to go largely unacknowledged. His name was Claude Heithaus, and this spring marks the 100th anniversary of his birth. Before Brown vs. the Board of Education had made its way to the Supreme Court in 1954, before the Archdiocese of St. Louis had integrated its schools, when St. Louis was an entirely segregated city, the Rev. Claude Heithaus, a Jesuit priest, took it upon himself to preach a sermon in the St. Frances Xavier (College) Church of St. Louis University, where he was a faculty member. In this sermon, which he delivered on the morning of Feb. 11, 1944, he called upon his listeners to repudiate racism and welcome people of color to the university. His words were uncompromising as he called upon the community to face its prejudice and hypocrisy: ``Do you want us to slam our doors in the face of Catholics, because their complexion happens to be brown or black? It (the claim that white students would refuse to attend classes with people of color) is a lie. I see that you repudiate it with indignation. You scorn it all the more because some of the very people who disseminate this lie have themselves sent their sons to Harvard and Yale, where they were glad to sit in the same classrooms with Negroes.'' Heithaus' call to justice, which he couched in religious as well as moral terms, did not go unnoticed. Within the year, St. Louis University became the first institution of higher learning in a former slave state to admit African-Americans, and the city of St. Louis thereby became the scene of one of the most important breakthroughs in racial integration. Heithaus soon departed from St. Louis. Because he had preached the sermon without the permission or support of his Jesuit superior and had continued to call attention to the problems of racism, he was banished, first to Kansas and then to Milwaukee. Late in life he was allowed to return to the St. Louis area, where he lived quietly, never speaking publicly again on the topic of race relations. He died in 1976. In the story of Heithaus' courage and determination there is much that St. Louis can be proud of. He risked--and lost-- a great deal in order to further a process of acceptance, toleration and integration that remains unfinished in our community. Although the first part of his story is fairly well known, the price he paid is less well known, and neither the university nor the community has ever formally recognized his accomplishments and sacrifices. After his speech and his subsequent refusal to drop the issue of race relations, his career as a teacher was severely curtailed. A valuable collection of antiquities that he had acquired on his travels was lost or destroyed. His work as a trainer of young journalists (a quarter century earlier he had founded St. Louis University's University News) came to an end as well. Even after the policies that Heithaus had called for became an accepted reality, he was never publicly thanked or even acknowledged by this community for his role in their realization, although the Father General of the Jesuits and the French government eventually recognized his accomplishments. While much of the responsibility for this acknowledgement lies with the school where I work, St. Louis University, some of it ultimately lies with the community that also benefited from his vision and persistence. His commitment and his ideals should not be forgotten. I call upon St. Louis University to mark the hundredth anniversary of Claude Heithaus' birth with some gesture worthy of his beliefs. I also call upon the greater St. Louis community to reflect on the actions of someone, who, when it was still politically incorrect, sought to widen educational opportunities for people of color. Surely there is a place in our city for some remembrance of him, a way to call attention to his ideals. Heithaus is of course not the only unsung hero of St. Louis history. In the past 200 years, many men and women in this community have stood for worthy but unpopular causes and paid high prices for their beliefs. We should give each one recognition, not only out of respect for what they did, but also for what their lives can offer all of us as models of courage and vision. And by honoring Claude Heithaus, we would be making a very good start.,2015-03-17 19:11:20.935727,2015-03-17 19:11:20.935727,Extensions,REMEMBERING REV. CLAUDE HEITHAUS--``A CIVIL RIGHTS TRAILBLAZER'',1998-04-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-28/html/CREC-1998-04-28-pt1-PgE692.htm,49,0,144,E692,C000488,mr. clay
2814,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the anniversary of an institution of higher learning in my district which this year celebrates 140 years of service in Northeast Missouri.Hannibal-LaGrange College has provided quality Christian education to thousands of students while facing tremendous obstacles along its journey, a journey through which God's guiding hand has been evident.The college opened its doors on September 15 of 1858. First located 30 miles to the north of its present location in LaGrange, Missouri, the LaGrange Male and Female Seminary was founded by the Wyaconda Baptist Association to instill character-building principles and Christian ideals in its students.At the helm of the vessel was William Ellis, who served as the college's first president. Ellis, who reached the tender age of 24 years the day before classes began that first year, served admirably in his duties until Union troops took over the college's facilities in 1862 during the War between the States.When the institution reopened in 1866, the new President, Dr. Joshua Flood Cook, certainly faced a daunting task. Building repairs were necessary, books and equipment were needed for the classrooms, the hiring of faculty was required, and community support and confidence had to be restored.Dr. Cook began remedying these problems immediately and over the next 30 years he served as president Dr. Cook worked as a tireless servant moving the college forward in a manner that has reached unequaled levels of success.In late 1927, the Hannibal Chamber of Commerce began an effort to bring the LaGrange College to Hannibal, Missouri. The following year, the institution moved south and has for 70 years been carrying out its place in history. The college's new move was mixed with a salute to our Nation's history as well. In 1932, to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth, the daughters of the American Revolution secured a number of trees from Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of our Nation's first president. Mr. Speaker, I was recently on campus and can assure you, these trees are still standing tall among the college's entrance drive today.All continued well for the college until 1973, when inflation and other factors put the college's future in jeopardy. When the campus was threatened with an imminent closing, community leaders, area residents, and Hannibal-LaGrange personnel reacted quickly and decisively, raising $85,000 to keep the college doors open. Again, faced with possible closure, Hannibal-LaGrange received a tremendous blessing in order to remain open.However, the most challenging obstacle was yet to come. In the summer of 1989, a small fire in the college's cafeteria soon engulfed the campus' main facilities, including the administration building, auditorium, and gymnasium. As the fire blazed through the night and the early morning hours, doubts about the college's future began to surface in even the heartiest of souls. By daylight only charred remains of the structures existed.Encouraged by his faith in God, then-President Dr. Paul Brown, as well as college personnel and supporters, began a massive effort to rebuild what was temporarily destroyed. As classes and assemblies were held that fall in tents and in trailers and dormitory basements, the campus began to take shape.In 1992, following the construction of a new sports complex, cafeteria and computer center, the new administration building was dedicated under the leadership of Dr. Brown and current President, Dr. Woodrow Burt. Hannibal-LaGrange has certainly become ``a crown of beauty instead of ashes.''This quote from Isaiah, chapter 61, verse 3, was placed on the cornerstone of the administration building, and today the college is continuing its vision as Dr. Burt and development officials are spearheading an effort to build a performance center for the institution's fine arts program. A new dormitory will be ready for the ever-increasing student population this fall which, by the way, Mr. Speaker, last year the student population not only came from northeast Missouri but New Hampshire, Texas, California and as far away as the West Indies and the country of Slovakia.In conclusion, Hannibal-LaGrange has persevered and has produced quality alumni. Thousands have passed through the corridors of Hannibal-LaGrange, each serving as a witness to the impact the college has had on their lives.Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Hannibal-LaGrange College on providing 140 years of Christian education. May God continue to bless this fine institution for many years to come.,2015-03-17 19:11:21.119851,2015-03-17 19:11:21.119851,House,HANNIBAL-LaGRANGE COLLEGE--140TH ANNIVERSARY,1998-07-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-17/html/CREC-1998-07-17-pt1-PgH5846.htm,96,1,144,H5846,H000948,mr. hulshof
2815,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) for yielding me this time.Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to the proposed change in rules and regulations and procedures. In my estimation, a decision to grant deposition authority to the Committee on Education and the Workforce would be unwise, unwarranted, and a radical break with House tradition and practices, and a very real threat to the civil liberties and privacy rights of American citizens.The new deposition authority is virtually unlimited in scope and duration. It permits the majority to engage in an unprecedented fishing expedition, even during the summer recess of this House.The chairman is seeking to acquire an extraordinary array of powers. With the stroke of a pen, he could summon to this Congress any American citizen for secret, under oath, behind-closed-doors interrogation. I am sure that the confidential testimony that our chairman just described will then either be officially, or through leaks, made public.Any citizen who is not frightened by this scenario should be, particularly given the very clear record of investigatory abuse by the Republican majority in this House. To place the Republicans' proposal in a fair historical context, I would remind the Members of this House that such a sweeping power has been assumed by this body or by the Senate very rarely and only under the most compelling of circumstances. Only when faced with grave accusations of government wrongdoing or with threats to our national security has this body deemed it necessary to assume a power which traditionally resides in the judicial branch of government.Madam Speaker, there is no compelling reasons for this authority. I ask why is it necessary to depose 40 witnesses in secret session? Not one Teamster has refused a subpoena before this committee. Not one Teamster has refused to come before the committee and testify under oath and in public. There is nothing concerning fraudulent pension matters that has surfaced before this committee. And if there were, this committee does not have the expertise or the resources or the commitment to do anything about it.Madam Speaker, I tell my colleagues that in this instance it is difficult to view the majority's proposal as anything other than a cynical power grab, a partisan fishing expedition, a concerted attack on organized labor, and an invitation to abuse innocent American citizens.This investigation, which has cost the taxpayers millions of dollars and dragged on for nearly a year, has been a shameful waste of time and money and an embarrassment to this institution. It is simply disingenuous for Republicans on the Committee on Education and the Workforce to claim that their failure to produce any new or relevant information regarding the 1996 Teamsters election is due to a lack of authority.The problem is that the story they wish to tell, one of widespread, systematic corruption throughout the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is one of fiction. No amount of snooping, interrogating, or wishful thinking will make it otherwise. This is simply too awesome a power, especially when considering that the chairman of the committee already has unilateral authority to issue subpoenas.Madam Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Goodling's words of assurance that committee Democrats will be involved in the deposition process and that other safeguards will be constructed around the proceedings. But with all due respect to my good friend, the past record of Republicans ignoring the rights of the minority on this committee does not speak well for such assurances.We were given the same guarantees regarding consultation and notice when the chairman appropriated the power to unilaterally issue subpoenas. {time} 1330Those promises have been consistently, routinely and casually broken. Perhaps most disturbing is the majority's proposal to allow staff who are not attorneys to conduct sworn depositions. The very thought is mind-boggling, American citizens being drugged into this little star chamber to be interrogated under oath in secret by staff who are not bound by or trained in the Code of Legal Ethics. This is an open invitation for abuse and for the violation of legitimate legal and constitutional rights.Legal proceedings should be conducted by those trained in the law, not by laymen. Testimony before Congress should be in a public arena for American citizens to judge guilt or innocence for themselves. I urge my colleagues to oppose this unwise and dangerous amendment to the rules of the House.,2015-03-17 19:11:21.279971,2015-03-17 19:11:21.279971,House,PROVIDING SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY FOR THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE,1998-07-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-30/html/CREC-1998-07-30-pt1-PgH6754-5.htm,105,10,144,H6754-H6766,C000488,mr. clay
2816,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my constituents, Anne Marie Foy, a student at Cor Jesu Academy who was recently awarded a Voice of Democracy Scholarship from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Ms. Foy's essay was one chosen as a national winner from over 116,000 submitted. The contest theme this year was ``Answering America's Call'' and I have included her winning essay below.Good morning friends. I come today to speak with you about an issue that is both very dear to my heart and extremely vital to our nation's well-being. I speak about our answer as citizens to America's call. Today I want to take a moment to reflect on this call and to see it in its fullness, as a necessary element of our personal democracy. I hope to inflame your American passions with these few words. In fact, I dream to awaken everything about you that defines you as an American citizen. In the past, to be an American was to determine your own destiny. It was to have a voice in your government and to take a considerable role in the governing of yourself and of your community. Never before in the history of the modern world had autonomy been so real, so tangible, and so evident. It was our political pluralism, the sovereign contract with our government as a democratic people, and our rights to assemble and disagree with our governing figures that united us as America. It was our political views that we transformed into civic activism and our personal involvement with the government that made us strong. The freedom we enjoyed as empowered citizens of this democratic nation led us to be one of the great superpowers of the world. We had found our strength as a country in our reply to the great American call. The truest beauty of America is her people. Under a democratic government each individual enjoys protected rights and liberties, but this political system is dependent on civic activism. Thus to enjoy your political rights, you must fulfill your responsibilities as a citizen and accept a political role. We as Americans are owners of a political mechanism designed to pursue justice, yet somehow in contemporary American society we managed to misplace the operations manual and have forgotten how to keep this beautiful machine working. If we are a government of the people, why are the people so upset at the government? In order to look at the real root problems we must first quiet our partisan babble, we must calm our nationalistic frustrations, we must look fearlessly at ourselves and then we must listen. Listening for our genuine voice is the first step. It will require patience and integrity and ultimately it will lead to an answer. How do you reply to this democratic call? You must first reply through education. We as citizens must become knowledgeable of our history, our laws, and our government structure. If we are not educated, these institutions will cease to exist. We must strive to be aware of current issues, and how our government is responding to them. We as United States citizens are the government. We cannot shut our eyes to what our representatives are doing. Education must be followed with action. A democratic state is dependent on this integrity. Whether we sit in on city council meetings, write letters to our government officials, or protest against things we view unjust, we must reply to the American call. If we feel far from Washington D.C. or detached from government, then we should rise up and demand straightforward dialogue. We must get past this glossy, polished, television image of the government. For we are the government. We are real. We are not polished. We are human. We have mentally separated ourselves from the government in this country. Government officials are no longer extensions of the people but, professional television personas. If we are upset with public officials, then we must vote them out of office. If we are tired of corrupt politicians, then we must speak with honesty ourselves and elect honest citizens. If we are exasperated with government programs, then we must take our seat on planning committees. In a world where so many fought and died for their independence, for their freedom, for their autonomy, America and her people should stand as an encouraging light and example. We have so many brilliant minds, and caring hearts, and noble spirits, and yet America seems lost, somewhat bewildered about her path, her future. We are her future. Our parents, our children, our countrymen, and our very selves, we are the ones that must decide her path. First we must hear the call and then as Americans, boldly and courageously, we must answer.,2015-03-17 19:11:21.435080,2015-03-17 19:11:21.435080,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO ANNE MARIE FOY,1996-04-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-17/html/CREC-1996-04-17-pt1-PgE554.htm,49,0,142,E554,T000024,mr. talent
2817,MO,Bill,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished and gentle man from southeast Missouri, a man who embodied what is right and good about this great Nation, Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr., a gentle man who earned the affectionate disinction, patriarch of southeast Missouri.Mr. Limbaugh passed away last week at the honorable age of 104 in his Cape Girardeau home of Sylvan Lane. He had a long and valuable life. His passing will inevitably leave a tremendous void. He was a dear friend and mentor of mine, and of countless others, from all walks of life.What made Mr. Limbaugh such a special person was his uniquely simple character. Those who had the privilege to come in contact with him certainly were amazed at his breadth of knowledge and command of oratory skills. No question, Rush Hudson Limbaugh Sr. was a living testament to the american dream. But he was without pretense, truly a humble man, a devout Republican and a very committed democrat.Born in rural Bollinger County, about 90 miles southwest of St. Louis, Mr. Limbaugh was the product of a one-room primary school. As with everything he approached in life, he excelled in his education. In fact, through diligence, organization, and keen focus, he put himself through high school, paying most of his expenses by doing carpenter work and farm labor. Following high school, he went to college at the University of Missouri at Columbia. His work on the university farm and various odd jobs, such as firing furnaces, carpentry, waiting tables, caring for animals, and assisting a Methodist minister all helped to foot the bill for his continuing education.He always stressed that the more you can learn, the better off you would be. His list of personal accomplishments help to prove that he was indeed a man who lived by his own words and convictions. He prepared himself well, worked hard, and made his family, community, and country proud.Among his most notable achievements, Mr. Limbaugh left this world last week as the oldest practicing attorney in the United States. That's right, at 104 years of age, Rush Hudson Limbaugh Sr. still went into the office at least twice a week to the Limbaugh, Russell, Payne and Howard law firm that he founded 50 years ago in Cape Girardeau. To help put his 80 years of service in perspective, he started practicing law in 1916 at the age of 24 when Woodrow Wilson was President.Not only was Mr. Limbaugh a scholar in the law, but also in history, in political theory and Judeo-Christian tradition. He and I shared a pleasure of never-endingly researching Abraham Lincoln. When we would get together, inevitably a discussion about Lincoln would come up, and we both looked forward to swapping new stories or novel tales about our Nation's 16th President.I would be remiss if I didn't mention Mr. Limbaugh's many contributions to our community and our Nation. He was a servant of the Methodist church, the Boy Scouts, and the Salvation Army among others. In 1958, one of his personal highlights came when the U.S. State Department invited him to lecture in a newly liberated India before lawyers, judges, and university students about constitutional government and the American judicial system. They were so impressed with his commentary and remarks that the All India Law Teachers Association subsequently honored him.We will all dearly miss Mr. Limbaugh, the patriarch of the Limbaugh family, of Cape Girardeau and of southeast Missouri. Many folks know about his now famous national radio talk show grandson, Rush Limbaugh III. ``Pop,'' as his family would call him, also is responsible for the great legal legacy of Limbaugh lawyers whom include son, a U.S. District Judge, a grandson, Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, another grandson, a prominent attorney in southeast Missouri and throughout the Midwest, a son and grandchildren who are educators.Throughout his extraordinary life, he was always true to his roots--hard working, composed, dedicated, and most of all humble. His life and character epitomize that America is the land of opportunity for those who have the heart and the will to make the most of it.Rush Hudson Limbaugh Sr. was indeed a legend in his time.,2015-03-17 19:11:21.592186,2015-03-17 19:11:21.592186,House,A TRIBUTE TO RUSH LIMBAUGH, SR.,1996-04-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-17/html/CREC-1996-04-17-pt1-PgH3550.htm,49,1,142,H3550-H3553,E000174,mr. emerson
2818,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,I thank and congratulate my colleague from Tennessee. Senator Frist has put his finger on the real problem in this budget. The President, in his budget, has glowing words, as several of my colleagues on the other side have, about the priorities that they think are important. The President has said that we must invest in education and training, the environment, science and technology, law enforcement, and other priorities.But, as I pointed out earlier today, when it comes to making these sets of numbers balance out, they have a meat ax, a paint-by-numbers meat ax that whacks 10 percent out of all of those budgets in 2001, and 18 percent in 2002. Now, are you for the priorities? If so, this is an opportunity to vote for some honesty in budgeting. The President has claimed he gets to balance. I think most of the people in this body say we want to get to balance. But do we really want to get to balance by taking the drastic cuts that my colleague from Tennessee has just talked about?I talked earlier this morning about the cuts in NIH, National Institutes of Health, FDA. Yesterday, I talked about the serious cuts that would happen to the Environmental Protection Agency if you apply this meat ax arbitrarily in 2001 and 2002, because the President's numbers do not add up, unless you have the meat ax.What the Senator from Tennessee is saying is, if you are serious about this budget, serious about reporting a responsible budget that gets to balance, let us take a look at what your budget, as now proposed, would actually do. It savages some of the very programs the President said he wants to promote and defend on the way to a balanced budget.Well, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you are serious about establishing priorities, if you really believe that numbers do not lie, if you believe that budgets should say what they mean and mean what they say, let us get rid of the arbitrary cuts in NIH, funding for the Women, Infants and Children Program, funding for child care, funding for the National Science Foundation, and NASA, and, yes, funding for the Veterans' Administration.My distinguished colleague who has had experience in working with the Veterans, Administration knows how compelling the needs of those veterans are. I have visited facilities and talked with people who are finding that the problems in those Veterans' Administration facilities cannot be dealt with.If we follow this meat ax budget approach, we would be closing more than one out of four veterans' facilities in the Nation. That means, as I said, California, with 11 hospitals, would lose 3, or probably 4. Our friends from California might want to tell us which of these four hospitals would be closed; and Florida, with six facilities, would probably lose at least one, maybe two; Illinois, with six, would also lose one or two; Massachusetts, at least one; Missouri, at least one; New York, at least three, and probably four; Pennsylvania, at least two, and probably three; Texas, at least two; Ohio, at least one.Do we arbitrarily want to close all of these facilities because we do not want to meet our obligations to the men and women who have defended this country who are either injured in war or who are now medically indigent? I cannot believe that is a serious budget proposal.If my colleagues really want to pursue the President's budget and defend his priority, then I urge them to vote for the Frist resolution so that they can go back and make some intelligent decisions rather than taking a meat ax to the very programs the President said he wants as his priorities. His program would slash environment, children, education, and health care for veterans. Mr. President, that is not acceptable.I urge my colleagues to support the amendment which I think is very well considered presented by the Senator from Tennessee.Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:11:21.736318,2015-03-17 19:11:21.736318,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET,1996-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-16/html/CREC-1996-05-16-pt1-PgS5111-6.htm,69,101,142,S5111-S5140,B000611,mr. bond
2819,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I am sure we will be able to accomplish what we need to accomplish in substantially less time.Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity to offer an amendment. I believe that it is important for us in this Congress, and in the bill which is before the Senate, to change the character of welfare. That is the challenge which is before us. We have to change a system which has provided people with a condition--a condition of dependence, a condition of relying on others, a condition which has been a trap--and we need to change welfare from being a condition to being a transition.The welfare situation should be a time when we prepare ourselves for the next step in our lives, when we prepare ourselves to be out of dependence and out of reliance on others, we prepare ourselves to be industrious, to be independent and reliant upon ourselves.Welfare cannot be something that is a lifestyle. It has to be something that is just for a while. It has to be something that moves us forward. I believe there are fundamental components of this bill which will do that, but we can enhance them substantially in their capacity to change the character of welfare, to change it from a way of life, to change it to a way of escape, to change it from a lifestyle, to change it to being a transition, to change it from a condition to being a transition.Mr. President, according to Senator Moynihan, the average welfare recipient spends 12.98 years on the rolls. That is a substantial and monumental waste of human resource. We have individuals who are reliant, who are dependent, whose level of contribution and productivity in our culture is very, very, very low, and that 12 years is a teaching time as well as a time of existence.Unfortunately, that 12 years becomes a time when young people are taught dependence instead of independence. They are taught reliance on Government instead of self-reliance.One of the things we should ask ourselves about everything we do in Government is: What does it teach? What does it reinforce? What basic principles and values are advanced by it? And a welfare system that provides for 12.98 years as the average time a welfare recipient spends on the rolls--what about those that are on there longer? This is not teaching something that is valuable to our culture. We need to be reinforcing, providing incentives for support for a system that does not institute a condition for life, making a career of welfare, but energizes a transition for life, leaving welfare and going to work.The 12.98 years is reflected in the fact that we have had soaring rates in the kind of social conditions that intensify the challenge and the condition of welfare--a 600-percent increase in illegitimacy over the last three decades. I think we can agree that the welfare system we now have is a miserable failure, but if we do not build into this system things to change the outcomes, we are going to end up with the same problems just being tougher and tougher to solve.Industrialist friends of mine tell me that whatever system you have, you can be assured that it is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting, and if you do not like what you are getting, you need to change the system.This welfare bill that we are debating today will shorten the time from 12.98 years down. It will limit most welfare recipients to a 5-year lifetime limit on temporary assistance to needy families.The big challenge of the 12-year problem is, What kind of habits do you build in 12 years? I suspect that if you involve yourself in a routine for 12 years, it is very difficult ever to break that routine. Sociologists tell us, if you want to lose weight--that is one of the things I want to do--they say you have to change your habits for about 6 or 7 weeks in order to have a new habit of diet, a new way to consume food. We are talking about changing habits that people have hardened for 12.98 years on average.One of the problems I have is that we have said we are going to change this by shortening the time period to 5 years. Well, 5 years will build a habit which is so strong that it is almost impossible to break. I think we need to find a way to restructure the system so that everyone looks at that 5-year period as if it is an insurance policy and they do not want to take any more out of that bank of 5 years than they need to at the moment because there might come a time sometime later in life when they would have a desperate need for assistance. I believe that is what we need to do.So we need to help people understand that there is 5 years. That is a lifetime limit. You should only draw from that savings account or reserve for emergencies what you desperately need and not use that 5 years as a way to create the habit of dependence which will be almost impossible for you to break.But this bill would allow for most individuals 5 years--5 years--without work. Five years without work would build such a habit that I believe we would nearly disable the individuals, as we have with our current system.I was stunned when I read in one of my home State papers last year that there was an experiment under a waiver granted by the Federal Government where they invited 140 welfare recipients to show up at a Tyson Foods plant. Only half of them showed up for work. They were invited to come in to look for a job. Of the half that showed up, only 39 accepted jobs. Of the 39 that accepted jobs, fewer than 30 were on the job a week after.See, what we have done is we have built habits. We have established a condition for welfare. We do not have welfare as a transition, as a place of movement; it has become a place of repose. I believe we need to change that. For us to say that, even under this bill, which is a significant reform, for us to say that we would allow people to have 5 straight years without work, where your self-esteem or your skills, your motivation would atrophy, would wither--if you do not use a muscle for 5 weeks, it gets weak. If you do not do not use it for 5 months, it almost disappears. If you do not use it for 5 years, it is gone.We have here the most important muscle in human character--self-esteem, skills, motivations. We are still providing in this bill that for as long as 5 years you can simply be there not working. The bill, as it stands, requires 15 percent of the unexempted population to work in the first year period, and 25 percent in the second year period--25 percent. That is one out of four. So for three out of four, they could go right by the first 2-year period and not even be involved in work.I believe, though, as a result of this, that welfare recipients, other than that 25 percent who actually went to work, could just choose to coast along for the full 5 years of benefits with no additional incentive to get a job. I think that is where this bill needs correction. It needs dramatic correction.I propose to amend this welfare bill to allow welfare recipients, able-bodied welfare recipients without infant children, to collect only 24 months of consecutive temporary assistance-to-needy-families benefits. At the end of those 2 years, if the recipient still refuses to work, I say, cut the benefit. What this really does is not result in cut benefits; this results in more people being willing to work.Instead of saying to an individual who gets on welfare, if you work the system, you can last for 5 years, create the habits of reliance, create the habits of repose, reject the habits of industry and work; this would basically say, you better get to work, learning to get a job right away, because after 2 years, in spite of the fact that there is a 5-year lifetime limit, there is a 24-month consecutive receipt-of-benefit limit for able-bodied adults without infant children.If a welfare recipient then decides not to work in the 2-year time span, the payment would cease. By doing this, we simply hope to inject a concept which is too novel which ought to be commonplace. That is the concept that work is beneficial and that it pays better and is better than welfare. Otherwise, we are simply going to be tempting people to stay on and approximate, or approach at least, as much as they can of the 12.98 years of time on welfare, which is now a debilitating and disabling influence in the American culture for too many Americans.Our intention is to leave the time period between any times you consume your 24 consecutive months total up to the States, so that recipients could not leave the welfare rolls and sign up again a week later. I think States could make these judgments about what kind of interval that would be needed between the 24-month periods. Our central point, our responsibility here, is to say that we want to provide as part of the structure of our reform the energy to change, legislation that changes welfare from being a lifestyle to being a transition. We want to start to energize a commitment on the part of recipients to make the changes in the way they live so that they avoid prolonged exposures to the welfare system and find themselves at an earlier time being capable of sustaining themselves.We want welfare recipients to look at this 5-year period as a lifetime cushion, not to be consumed in the first need or the second need, hopefully never to be consumed. Our objective should be that no one ever bumps the 5-year limit. Our objective should be that we energize people to go to work so quickly and so enthusiastically that they maintain their reserve to the day they die.Permitting able-bodied welfare recipients to remain on assistance for a straight 5-year-long block of time simply would reinforce, reteach, perpetuate, and underscore the current cycle of dependence. We need to stop this cycle of dependence, not just for individuals, but for what it teaches to our children. Welfare has become an intergenerational phenomenon, where people are on so long that their children grow up knowing only one lifestyle--it is welfare. By limiting the uninterrupted block of time that welfare recipients remain on the rolls, we will reduce the level of dependence on government assistance.Welfare can be habit forming, and has been habit forming. It can be addictive. It can be destructive, and it has been. We need to take the structural components of the welfare system, which are dehumanizing, demeaning and disabling, out of the system. We need to energize each individual to view welfare as transitional. We should do that by saying there can be no more than 24 consecutive months on welfare for any able-bodied individual without infant children, unless they will work.I just indicate that on Tuesday of this last week President Clinton ordered that in case we do not pass welfare reform in the next few months, the Department of Health and Human Services will give States the power to cut off benefits if an able-bodied adult refuses to work after 2 years. This is not a Draconian message. This is a message and this is a concept called for by the President of the United States.For us to deliver a welfare system back to the American people which reinforces, underlines, and strengthens the bad habit of long-term dependency would not only be an affront to the American people, but it would be our failure to respond to a President who has asked us to do much better. There is something much better that we should be doing, and something we can do. If we want to break the long-term aspects, the intergenerational aspects of welfare, we have to be a part of this teaching idea in a real way.When I was Governor of the State of Missouri and I had the great privilege of serving the people of my State, we came to Washington to ask for a waiver, a waiver from the regulations of the Federal Government. The waiver was simply this: We said, please give Missouri the right to say to welfare recipients, if you do not make sure your kids are in school, you will not get your full benefit. It was a way of saying welfare is not a place where you can throw responsibility to the wind. It was a way of saying, if you are a parent, you have to be responsible for at least some fundamental basic things, like getting your kids to school, because we do not want your kids to stay at home and learn welfare, we want your kids to go to school and learn how to be productive. We were able to get that waiver. The program was called People Attaining Self-Sufficiency, PASS. PASS had some reference to school. We wanted kids to pass in school by having good attendance.I think there is another part of the structure of welfare reform that we should embrace as we send the bill to the President of the United States. We should not have to have States coming to Washington, waiting 2 or 3 years, filling out enough paperwork to choke a horse in order to have the privilege of saying to people, ``We expect you to make sure your kids are in school or we are not going to make sure your check is in the mail.'' It is that simple. It is very fundamental. If you are on welfare, your kids should be in school, because it is especially important to break the intergenerational chain of dependence. Part of this measure is to make sure we say to the individuals, ``You have some responsibility.''Another important concept of this amendment is that it would allow States to require temporary assistance to needy families and food stamp recipients to either have a high school education or work toward attaining a high school education. It is my judgment that it is not very realistic to say to people, ``We are sending you to work, but you do not have to have the kind of fundamental and basic skills that come from education.'' I am not talking about worker training here, I am talking about education. I am talking about the fact that an educated person can read the manual and train himself or herself. I am talking about the fundamental responsibility of culture, not the responsibility of a business to train people to do its business. I am talking about the fundamental responsibility of a culture to train its citizens by way of education.Education is different, really, from training. Education is the basis upon which training builds. A person who cannot read or write will have a hard time, no matter how much training she gets. I believe if a person is going to be receiving this assistance that we need to say to them, ``You are going to have to invest in yourself to the extent of having a high school education or a general equivalency diploma. The truth of the matter is you have a responsibility, and you have to be prepared to meet that responsibility.''As a matter of fact, this is a far more important thing than it has ever been before, because once we put a time limit on these matters, we need to energize people to be ready in order to fend for themselves when the time limit has expired. I hope we will have a 2-year time length on consecutive months of benefits, 24 months, and I believe in a 5-year lifetime benefit, as well. With that in mind we will have to make sure that people can fend for themselves at the expiration of that time.Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time, but I am happy to yield back my time on the amendment when all time is ready to be yielded back.,2015-03-17 19:11:21.879390,2015-03-17 19:11:21.879390,Senate,PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1996,1996-07-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-22/html/CREC-1996-07-22-pt1-PgS8395-5.htm,108,54,142,S8395-S8426,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2820,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, there are three basic thrusts that are undertaken in these amendments. They are the conversion of a system from being a system of conditioning people to be dependent to transitioning people to be at work.The first thrust is that we would have a 24-consecutive-month limit on welfare for those who refuse to work or get training at the end of the 24 months. It seems to me that is something that the President of the United States called for last week and which we ought to have.The second component of this strategy is to say that those who are on welfare should have their children in school. It is not something that is unknown or mysterious. The fact of the matter is that high school dropouts average $12,809 a year, a poverty-level standard of living for a family of three. For an individual who has a high school degree, the average is $18,737, a 46-percent higher income than the average for dropouts.Half of those arrested for drug violations in 1995 did not have a high school diploma. And the preponderance of all crimes, 40 percent of all crimes, were committed by those who did not finish high school. It is time for us to ask those who are involved in the welfare system by way of receiving benefits under temporary assistance to needy families to make sure that their children are in school.A high school degree is a key to escaping from the welfare trap. Statistics show that it keeps kids out of jail. Every parent has a principal and primary responsibility to make sure their children receive the kinds of fundamentals that will allow them to fend for themselves. Every child can attend school in America. Every child can earn a high school diploma. It costs nothing but commitment and responsibility. Too often this opportunity is ignored--even trashed. Teens drop out of school, grade school, or skip classes. This is a tragic waste of a precious resource, one on which our culture must rely.All of our Government institutions should do everything possible to ensure that children go to school and earn a degree. Government should certainly not be paying parents to let their kids play hooky and skip school. If you are on welfare, your kids should be in school. Parents should not be coconspirators in perpetuating their children in a lifetime on and off of welfare, in and out of minimum-wage jobs, and irresponsibility. Children must go to school in order to break the cycle of dependency, to change welfare from being a long-term condition into being a transition.The amendment that I propose allows States--I repeat, allows States--to sanction welfare recipients of the temporary assistance to needy families that do not ensure that their children are attending school. It also allows States to sanction food stamp recipients who do not send their children to school. Children who graduate from a welfare system should be armed with a degree rather than with a habit of dependence. It is the key to self-reliance and success.We have watched, as the Nation has watched, the Olympics. We need our full team on the field whenever we play. Even ``The Dream Team'' would have a tough time if they did not have the entire capacity of the team available as a resource. And yet we allow our citizens sometimes to ask for our help and to persist in receiving it without equipping themselves, without making a commitment to themselves. The last component of my amendments is really a way of saying if you are going to be on welfare, you have to have or be working toward a high school diploma so you can work for yourself and help yourself.It is no mystery. States may require that temporary assistance to needy families and food stamp recipients work toward attaining a high school diploma or its equivalent as a condition of receiving welfare assistance. This requirement would not apply if an individual was determined in the judgment of medical, psychiatric, or other appropriate professionals to lack the requisite capacity to attain a high school diploma or GED.During the debate this year in the Senate, Senator Simon once said, ``We can have all the job training in the world, but if we do not face the problem of basic education, we are not going to do what we ought to do for this country.''I cannot agree more with that statement. It does not pay us to provide job training upon job training upon job training when welfare recipients have not achieved proficiency in the fundamental underlying skills of mathematics, English, and reading which provide people with the tools to benefit from job training and to assimilate changes in the job market. We do not have jobs and crafts that do not change. They all have new processes and new procedures. As technology marches on, it is important to make sure that individuals cannot only get the right kind of job training but they possess the fundamental characteristic of being educated in order to be able to take advantage of job training when it comes along.A person over 18 without a high school diploma averages $12,800 in earnings; with a high school diploma, $18,700 in earnings. A $6,000 difference is the difference between dependence and independence, the difference between self-reliance and reliance on Government. The U.S. Sentencing Commission determined that 40 percent of the individuals who commit crimes are individuals without high school diplomas. The Commission also found that these individuals are responsible for 50 percent of all drug violations. If people are going to receive welfare benefits, they should at least be working toward the fundamental equipping, enabling, freeing achievement of having a high school education.Mr. President, I would be pleased together with the opponents of this amendment on the other side of the aisle to yield back the remainder of the time.,2015-03-17 19:11:22.123569,2015-03-17 19:11:22.123569,Senate,PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1996,1996-07-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-22/html/CREC-1996-07-22-pt1-PgS8395-5.htm,108,112,142,S8395-S8426,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2821,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.I am grateful for this opportunity to rise in support of this legislation, known as the Defense of Marriage Act. I believe it is important for us to outline exactly what this bill would do and what it would not do, because in much of the discussion, it is portrayed as a measure which would overrule State laws and somehow snatch from States the capacity for defining what a marriage is within the State.The truth of the matter is, this would not change the capacity of States to define for their own purposes the nature of marriage in any State in America. It would define, for purposes of the Federal Government, what constitutes a marriage. And that is very important, because unless we have a Federal definition of what marriage is, a variety of States around the country could define marriage differently--they have not to date--and if they were to define marriage differently, people in different States would have different eligibility to receive Federal benefits, which would be inappropriate.It has been said that it is not important to do this because there have not been any States making these changes. I think it is pretty clear that it is important to do this because States are on the brink of making such changes, one State's law having been stricken by its highest court on the basis that it was unduly discriminatory.Let me just indicate that as long ago as in the 1970's, a male demanded increased educational benefits from the U.S. Government when he claimed that another male individual was his dependent spouse. The Veterans' Administration turned him down, and the Veterans' Administration was sued. The outcome turned on a Federal statute that made eligibility for the benefits contingent on his State's definition of ``spouse'' and ``marriage.''If the definition is different in one State for Federal benefits than it is in another State, we will find that States will be able to accord benefits to citizens in a way which is irrational and inconsistent, giving citizens of one State higher benefits or different benefits than citizens of another State.It is time for the Federal Government to define what a marriage is for purposes of Federal benefits which, obviously, come at the expense of the taxpayers of this country. It is not unreasonable at all, for purposes of Federal benefits, whether it is Social Security, education benefits, or veterans benefits of one kind or another, for this Congress to say these are the conditions under which those benefits flow. They should be uniform for people no matter where they come from in this country. People in one State should not have a higher claim on Federal benefits than people in another State.For that reason, it is entirely appropriate for us, as a Congress, to say that we want a Federal benefits structure that follows a uniform definition of ``marriage,'' and for purposes of the Federal benefits program, we have this definition, and that is what this law provides.Second, this law then says that a State will not be required to recognize another State's definition of marriage if that includes individuals of the same sex. Now, every State has benefits that flow to those who are married. It comes from the fact that there are real societal and social benefits to marriages. Marriages bring children into the world. That is the next generation.Unfortunately, it is the young people who defend the country when we are assaulted from abroad. And if you don't have children who grow up to be in the work force, who pays for the retirement of those who have already retired? We have set up our society on the basis of children who come into the world, and we honor the institution that brings children into the world and gives them values, by according special standing to marriage. That is not only done at the Federal level, which we already have addressed, it is done in every State in America.A State ought to be able to say you are going to get these benefits if you are in this category, if you meet this definition of marriage. But if we use the term marriage in one State and then we allow another State to define it as something entirely different than what the first State which was developing the benefit structure intended, we have really allowed one State to define for other States what will be the qualifying characteristics for their laws and their benefits.It is clear to me that a State should have the right to say that these are the characteristics of the relationship which will result in our State according you either the deduction or the special benefit, whether it relates to taxes or education or inheritance or the like. States should have the right to do that on their own terms.So this proposal simply defines, in a uniform way for Federal benefits, the nature of what a marriage is, and it says that no State shall be able to impose its definition of marriage on other States.I thank the Chair.,2015-03-17 19:11:22.336723,2015-03-17 19:11:22.336723,Senate,DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT,1996-09-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-09-10/html/CREC-1996-09-10-pt1-PgS10100-2.htm,123,88,142,S10100-S10125,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2822,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, in 1794 George Washington said, ``I know of no other pursuit in which more real and important services can be rendered to any country than improving its agriculture.'' These words mean as much today, over 200 years later, as they did then. Agricultural industries employ nearly 20 percent of all Americans.Today, I rise to honor a dear friend for 26 years of dedicated service to Missouri agriculture. On September 24, 1996, Lowell Mohler will gather with friends, family, and colleagues to celebrate the achievements of his distinguished career with the Missouri Farm Bureau. Lowell is a native Missourian born in Oregon, MO. Agriculture was always in his blood. Upon receiving his agriculture degree from the University of Missouri, he pursued an active career in agriculture, including assistant director of marketing for the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, marketing director of the Missouri Department of Agriculture and a vital member of the Missouri Farm Bureau.Lowell began his career with the Missouri Farm Bureau in 1970 and currently serves as the chief administrative officer and corporate secretary. For many years, Lowell has been a driving force meeting Missouri farmers' needs. Over these years, Lowell has been honored by his peers many times over. In April 1988, Gamma Sigma Delta, a national honor society recognizing individuals for scholarship and service in agriculture, honored him with the Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award for his outstanding support of the University of Missouri's College of Agriculture. In September 1990, Lowell was again honored with the Missouri University Alumni Association Distinguished Service Award for his continuing support and efforts in adding to the excellence of the university. In January 1991, he received the Missouri University Citation of Merit Award and the Presidential Citation Award for Extension. In October 1991, he received the State Friend of Extension Award in recognition of outstanding public service and support of the Missouri Cooperative Extension Service and its educational programs. In 1995, he was honored with the Ag Leader of the Year Award presented by the Missouri Ag Industries Council. Lowell's attributes are many as his honors describe.Lowell was there during the devastating Missouri flood of 1993, helping farmer after farmer cope with their great losses due to rising floodwaters. His own farm, which borders the great Missouri River, also fell victim with huge crop losses due to the floodwaters. But Missouri farmers persevered and overcame with the help of Lowell and the Missouri Farm Bureau.Lowell's generosity, integrity and foresight have continued over the years to keep Missouri agricultural interests strong for Missouri families and farmers. American farmers set the world agricultural standards by producing the highest quality products at the lowest prices. Missouri's 28 million acres of farmland and production of beef rank second in the Nation. Missouri is also among the top 15 States producing rice, soybeans, milo, hay, corn, and cotton. Agriculture is a critical force in Missouri's economy as well as the Nation's.On a personal note, my friendship with Lowell has afforded me the opportunity of his wisdom. Lowell was always happy to advise me regarding my farm in Missouri. He unselfishly assisted me in planning and complying with conservation regulations, particularly in the area of soil and water conservation, tree preservation and replanting, pasture rotation, and general farm management. During my tenure as Governor, Lowell served on the transition team in 1985 to 1986; he was also appointed to the business and education partnership commission, which was a task force to study the higher education system in Missouri. Lowell provided me countless hours of advice on agricultural policy important to Missouri farmers and ranchers, which was a result of policy established by the grassroots development process of the Missouri Farm Bureau. His whole family was involved, too. Lowell's wife, JoAnn, served as my executive secretary from 1985 to 1993 during my tenure as Governor of Missouri. Lowell and JoAnn continue to be close friends, whom I respect for advice and guidance.For these important reasons, I rise today to recognize and salute my friend for not only the 26 years of exemplary service to the Missouri Farm Bureau, but for his lifelong dedication to the Missouri agricultural industry. Lowell Mohler's service and friendship has been an inspiring testimony to me as well as all Missourians.,2015-03-17 19:11:22.479823,2015-03-17 19:11:22.479823,Senate,HONORING LOWELL MOHLER, CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OF THE MISSOURI FARM BUREAU,1996-09-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-09-20/html/CREC-1996-09-20-pt1-PgS11087-4.htm,131,0,142,S11087-S11088,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2823,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. I have just a few brief thoughts on this budget that has been submitted to us. The President's budget says we are going to have about a $4 trillion surplus over the next 15 years. He has said, and we agree, that we should fix Social Security first. We are going to do that. He believes that we ought to set 62 percent of the surplus aside for fixing Social Security. Again, we agree, because that is about what Social Security receipts are provided.But when we got his budget message and when we heard his State of the Union, we didn't see a fix to Social Security. We saw new gimmicks, financial gimmicks, borrowing more money. And under this plan that he has presented, while we are supposedly running these surpluses that will amount to $4 trillion, we are going to have to raise the debt ceiling within a couple of years because he is issuing more bonds. We are going to borrow our way into solvency for Social Security. Nobody has explained yet how that is going to work. But it is clear that he has not proposed any responsible reform of the Social Security system to make sure it is there. We in Congress are going to have to develop a plan. I believe we will. It is going to take some of the surplus, 62 percent. I think that we must do that because we owe that not only to those who are retired now and those who are about to retire, but to the baby boomers and others coming along who want to see retirement security.So we have 38 percent. What do we do with the remaining 38 percent of the surplus? I have spent a lot of time. I traveled around the State of Missouri many, many days listening to and talking with people, telling them: We finally got that budget deficit monster slain. What should we do with the surplus we are going to start running? And they had two very strong ideas. They said, No. 1, pay off the debt. We started to pay off the debt. If it hadn't been for the President's having invested some $20-plus billion in spending last year, we would have paid off $20 billion more.Frankly, around this place there is nothing quite so tempting as an unspent surplus. If you don't return it to the taxpayers, it is going to get spent. We already have a historically high tax rate as part of our gross domestic product, the highest it has been since the end of World War II. And we are continuing to take more and more money. We need to have tax relief. That is the other thing that the people of Missouri say: We want tax relief; lower, simpler, flatter taxes.Small businesses spend 5 percent of what they take in just figuring out how much they are going to have to pay in taxes. That is before they pay taxes. It is too complicated. It is too high. It discourages economic activity. Those who made fun of the capital gains tax relief and objected to it now have to admit that reducing capital gains brought more economic activity and brought a tremendous increase in capital gains revenue. If we give families and small businesses the opportunity to keep some of their money, do you know what? They can spend it better than we can in Washington, and that is what I propose we do.But the President is not content with a $4 trillion surplus. He wants to increase Federal Government revenues by raising taxes. And on top of that, he is going to spend it all, he is going to spend more of it, he is going to spend $100 billion in new spending. He busts the cap. He even raids the tobacco settlements from the States because he has so many good ideas on how to spend it.Mr. President, I do not believe the people of America want those good ideas. It is unbelievable, $4 trillion in surplus yet every dollar of it spent, then more taxes are added. This is a classic example of the Federal ``Father Knows Best,'' requiring the States, localities, and most of all the families, the working men and women in America, to play ``Mother May I?''Let's take a look at education, something I think is a top priority, and the President says it is a top priority, too. It is about that point where we diverge 180 degrees. The President wants to be your local school superintendent. Do you know, we have over 763 Federal education programs. The system is not working now. We have too much Federal bureaucracy, too much Federal red tape. Yesterday the President told the school board members who were in town from school boards all across the country, he said, ``Listen to what they are saying in the schools.'' I have. Do you know what they are saying? Do you know what educators and the administrators and school board members are saying? ``We have too much Federal regulation and dictates. We spend too much time on misplaced Federal priorities.''That is why I want, and I think my colleagues want, to return dollars directly to the classroom. Do not run it through the bureaucracy in Washington, DC. Don't even run it through the State bureaucracies. It is the school districts that have to make the decisions. They are the ones that know the kids' names. They are the ones that know the strengths of the kids. They are the ones that know the challenges they face. Let them make the decisions and take the Federal handcuffs off of local educators.,2015-03-17 19:11:22.724998,2015-03-17 19:11:22.724998,Senate,THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET,1999-02-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-02-03/html/CREC-1999-02-03-pt1-PgS1122-2.htm,19,5,145,S1122-S1129,B000611,mr. bond
2824,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Tennessee, first of all, for his sensitivity to what is happening in the schools of America. His visiting the schools is something which I find to be very important. You can sit here in Washington for a long time and cook up all sorts of theories about how schools ought to be, but until you talk to the people in the schools--and in his case Nashville, Davidson County--until you talk to the principals and teachers and parents, you do not understand the problems created by our current Federal IDEA law. The Senator from Tennessee has found out that in a 1-year snapshot there were eight detected possessions of weapons in the schools, six of which were from students covered by individualized education plans, and three of which our law--the law that we made--says schools can't expel those students the way they ought to be able to expel them. He has pointed out we should fix the law.What is interesting to me--and I commend the Senator from Tennessee. I have visited school districts all across the State of Missouri. I have gone to district after district to try and assert exactly what it is we should be doing. I have had school superintendents mention to me time after time this same problem. I talked to one small school district superintendent who talked about the dangers of not being able to have discipline in these settings. He talked about a student who threatened to kill other students seven times--threaten to shoot them.Finally, the individual shot another student. Fortunately, the shot took place off the school premises so that the legal authorities incarcerated the student. They didn't have to go through the painful procedure of trying to discipline him within the confines of this law which makes it virtually impossible to exercise the kind of discipline necessary.This bill is very simple. This bill is not designed to hurt any group of students. This is designed to secure the classroom. There isn't any class of students that is better off being favored and being able to bring guns or bombs to school. That is not in the interest of any group of students.This bill basically takes off barriers that the Congress placed in the path of good school administrators, parents, teachers and local school boards. We erected barriers that kept from taking students who had guns in their possession out of schools--merely because they were determined to be in some way disabled.This amendment simply says in spite of the fact that you are a student--of course, one out of every eight students nationally turns out to be disabled; one in seven in the State of Missouri--the fact that you are in this category called IDEA, doesn't mean you can bring a gun or a bomb to school with impunity.We simply take the barriers, the roadblocks out of the system. We say to school administrators and principals: You are free to discipline these students uniformly, just like you would discipline other students.I think that is a very important, profoundly simple point. It is the kind of correction which we only make when we get out and talk to people out there who are running the schools. When they tell you they can't discipline kids who are threatening over and over to kill other students, who eventually shoot other students, when they tell you they can't keep kids who brought guns to school out of school or from bringing guns back into school, and because of Federal procedures that say disciplines are more difficult the second time because we set up a Federal bureaucracy that keeps schools from being able to exercise discipline, it is time to say the most important thing for students--whether disabled, conventional, mainstream or not--the most important thing for that classroom is safety.When you keep guns and bombs out of the school, you promote the safety of all students.I am here to say how much I appreciate the opportunity to be able to sponsor this amendment that gives local schools, principals, teachers, parents and school boards the right to maintain gun-free, bomb-free schools, to have safe learning environments where students, without the feeling of threat and insecurity, can actually learn.It is a pleasure to be a cosponsor of this amendment with Senator Frist. I commend him. We all want to do everything we can for the education of all of our students. Our students who are disabled deserve our special compassion and attention, and more than any others, they deserve the protection that is afforded when we can have the ability to have secure, safe learning environments. We can do that when we allow our administrators to make sure that those individuals who bring guns to school can be disciplined.One last point: The law that provides for expulsion of students who bring guns to schools gives principals discretion to allow students to reenter the school. That same discretion would apply to these kinds of students as it applies to conventional students.This is a field leveler. It puts people on the same level and it puts the safety of our schoolchildren in first place--not part of our schoolchildren, all of them. Disabled children, other individuals, the entire school population must have the assurance that school officials have the capacity to enforce safe schools.I thank the Senator from Tennessee and others for joining in this. I am honored to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.,2015-03-17 19:11:23.082245,2015-03-17 19:11:23.082245,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-14/html/CREC-1999-05-14-pt1-PgS5335.htm,70,155,145,S5335-S5350,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2825,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, today the United States Senate completes its business for calendar year 1999 by passing two important bills: H.R. 3194--the final spending bill, and H.R. 1180--the Work Incentives Act, which provides new opportunities for disabled individuals to enter the work force and includes $18 billion dollars in tax cuts. I am pleased to announce my support for both these bills.The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has eloquently explained how this budget agreement keeps faith with the Republican pledge that no Social Security trust fund monies be used to pay for other government programs.Last year, for the first since 1960--during the Eisenhower Administration--we balanced the budget without counting the Social Security surplus. Mr. President, for the first time in 39 years the government did not divert money from the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for other programs.As a result of the spending plan pursued by this Republican Congress, which called for protection of Social Security, increased spending on education and defense, and reduction of the national debt, we have begun to put our fiscal House in order.When I was elected to this body in 1994, the incoming 104th Congress inherited a projected four-year budget deficit of $906 billion. Now, through the hard work and discipline of this Congress, the tables have turned. That actual four-year period produced a net budget surplus of $63 billion--a turnaround of $969 billion, just a shade under a trillion dollars. With the passage of the final FY 2000 appropriations bill, we will continue on that path, reducing our national debt by $140 billion dollars in the current fiscal year.Unlike last year's omnibus appropriations package that increased spending by almost $14 billion, this Congress successfully obtained offsets for all of the President's new spending, including an across-the-board cut that will help eliminate government waste and excess. In addition, despite President Clinton's best efforts, the offsets do not include a tax increase.At the beginning of this year, I said that the Congress' primary responsibility was to protect the Social Security surplus. With the passage of this budget, we have accomplished that goal. In addition, not only have we avoided a tax hike, but we have also given the American people an $18 billion tax cut through the provisions contained in H.R. 1180--the Work Incentives Act.I am pleased that the final bill includes over $2 billion in additional education spending over last year and gives local school districts more flexibility in how they spend that federal assistance. The appropriations bill also contains an increase of $1.7 billion for veterans spending above President Clinton's request, as well as an increase in funding for national defense that includes a boost in pay and benefits for our soldiers, sailors, and airmen.But this bill does not just fund these important priorities, it also provides real cuts in government waste and abuse. The legislation includes a 0.38% across the board reduction that is essential to maintaining our fiscal discipline and protecting Social Security.Included in this package are provisions to address some unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to protect Medicare recipients and providers. This bill includes $16 billion over 5 years to ensure that senior citizens can continue to receive quality health care.These Medicare changes will help Medicare patients in hospitals--particularly rural, teaching, and cancer hospitals--skilled nursing facility residents, home health care recipients, and seniors who wish to receive their health care through the innovative Medicare+Choice program rather than through the conventional fee-for-service mechanism. I have traveled around Missouri and heard from countless doctors, patients, nurses, and other health care providers about the necessity of these changes. These provisions are good for the seniors in Missouri and across the Nation.The package also provides for State Department Reauthorization, including language I authored that requires the State Department to publish a report documenting American victims of terrorist attacks in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank.In addition, the almost 400,000 Missouri households that are satellite television viewers will be pleased that this bill includes language that will allow them to continue receiving local programming. The Satellite Home Viewer Act will give real price competition and choice in video programming to all Missourians.Finally, Mr. President, I am pleased that unlike last year, when we lumped all the bills together, allowing $14 billion in extra spending into one package, this year we finished our work on each of the bills, and negotiated each bill on its individual merits. While this bill is an omnibus package for procedural reasons, it was not negotiated as an omnibus package. Every provision was negotiated according to regular order, and as a result, we were able to succeed in our goal of protecting Social Security.,2015-03-17 19:11:23.348435,2015-03-17 19:11:23.348435,Senate,TICKET TO WORK AND WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued,1999-11-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-19/html/CREC-1999-11-19-pt2-PgS14977.htm,165,5,145,S14977-S14986,A000356,mr. ashcroft

2828,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I thank the Chair.Mr. President, I look forward to the passage of the Ed-Flex Partnership Act, which I believe will liberate schools and teachers from the costly burden of Federal mandates and regulations. It is very important that we free our teachers to teach and that we free the resources of the educational system to meet the needs of students, rather than to satisfy directives of the bureaucracy.I believe this bill will give America's teachers more freedom to teach. It will release them from countless hours spent filling out forms from Washington, DC. The State of Missouri's 525 school districts will have more time to educate their children and a greater ability to decide how best to use the precious resource of taxpayer dollars, and how to use those to devote them to the best interests of students and student achievement, and not for a sort of edification of the bureaucracy in Washington.So I want to thank Senator Wyden, Senator Frist, and Senator Jeffords: Senator Jeffords as chairman of the relevant committee, and Senators Frist and Wyden, who are the lead cosponsors of this important legislation. They have done wonderful work here.This is work designed to find its way all the way to the student in the school system. So much of what is done in the name of education never finds its way to the student. So often it edifies the bureaucracy, or builds it, or strengthens it. So often it applies to some hierarchical part of the State educational system. But Ed-Flex is designed to carry the benefit all the way to the student. There is one thing that we care about more than anything else, and that is the student in the school system. Sometimes we lose sight of that. I commend Senators Frist, Wyden, and Jeffords for their having kept the student in focus in this particular measure.I am also pleased to support this conference report because it contains an amendment that I proposed, which makes an important change to a discipline provision within the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Now, this provision, which the Senate approved by a vote of 78-21, gives school authorities the opportunity and the right to discipline any student who possesses a weapon on school premises. This provision allows a school to place a student--even a student with a disability--in an interim alternative educational setting if the student carries or possesses a gun on school premises. This action closes a loophole in the IDEA law that only permitted a school to take disciplinary action if the child carried the weapon to school, but not if he or she possessed the weapon at school.My intent in offering this provision over a month ago was to empower schools to maintain a safe and secure learning environment for students, teachers, and for other school personnel.America is saddened today, and we all grieve at yesterday's tragic situation in the Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. That situation underscores the need for us to continue to find ways to help teachers, parents, and school officials maintain safer schools. We need to be creating a learning environment that is free of undue disruption or violence. We should give local school officials the authority to enforce zero tolerance of weapons brought to school. That is a step in which this bill goes when it includes the ability to discipline students who bring guns to school or possess guns at school.I know all of us here offer our condolences, heartfelt sympathies, to all of the families, the loved ones, the teachers, and to the communities that surround or are involved in the tragedy in Colorado.We don't know all the facts of this incident. We don't know the complete background on the students who are allegedly involved in this situation. But this incident should prompt in us a desire to examine our current Federal laws and to make whatever necessary changes there are, if there can be changes made to prevent tragedies like this from occurring.Since I became a Member of the Senate in 1995, I have had concerns about school safety. I have already worked to make improvements in Federal law to create a safer learning environment for students and teachers. My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of the 15-year-old in St. Louis named Christine Smetzer. She was killed in the restroom of a high school in St. Louis County.Now, the male special education student convicted of murdering Christine had a juvenile record and had been caught in women's restrooms at a previous school. However, the teachers and the administrators at McCluer High School where he was transferred say they were not informed of the student's record when he transferred to their school. So here you have a student who should have been identified, could have been identified as a student who had a special potential for the kind of violence and danger that transpired. The student was transferred, but the information that would have alerted school officials to make the school a safer environment, to help that student avoid the commission of the crime, and certainly to prevent the kind of tragic outcome, the killing of another student, our Federal laws were part of the problem that kept that from happening.So in response to that, I secured a provision in the law requiring that student disciplinary records transfer to a new school when the student transfers to a new school. That was just a small step taken in response to that 1995 problem with student discipline requirements that the Federal Government imposes.Now, the discipline provision in the bill that we are discussing here today was something that I, frankly, came to understand as a result of discussing concerns with Missouri schools. A suburban Missouri school district told me it found a disabled student to be in possession of a weapon at school, but the school could not be sure that the student had actually carried the weapon to the school premises. This school told me it needed this loophole closed to ensure that it could act swiftly and with confidence to an obviously dangerous situation.You can imagine the inability to discipline somebody because they said, ``I didn't carry the gun on to the premises, I just got it after I was here,'' or ``I found it in my locker or on the floor,'' or ``You can't prove that I brought it into the school. Therefore, you can't discipline me for having a gun at school.''What a terrible situation that is. So when I sought to offer this amendment--which was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate and remains in the conference committee report--it was in response to this need to make sure that the Federal Government doesn't have rules that make it impossible for local schools to be able to maintain a secure and safe school environment.Interestingly enough, 2 weeks ago, I was traveling in the State of Missouri, talking with teachers and parents and principals and administrators to get their input about education. Time after time, they talked to me about safety and about discipline. Very often, they even mentioned weapons at school. They mentioned that the Federal law was handcuffing their ability to take appropriate steps to keep their schools safe.In a specific school--I was told by the administrator of that school, this is not a hypothetical, but I choose not to name the school because the school would prefer not to be identified--I was told of a situation in a rural Missouri school where a disabled student had made numerous threats against both students and staff, had threatened on at least seven occasions to kill other students or staff. The school was aware of the threats, but was hindered by the Federal law from taking steps that they thought were most appropriate to deal with the student.Later, this high school student finally shot another student. The shooting happened off school grounds and the school was able to remove the student from the classroom once the shooting had taken place.But I wonder if we might think carefully as to whether or not the Federal requirements which tie the hands of State officials and school officials regarding school discipline, whether those Federal knots, Federal handcuffs--ought to be taken off our school principals, our teachers, our administrators, our school boards so that they have the ability at an early time when there is an early warning to take steps to avoid the tragedy that can otherwise exist. In this situation they weren't able to actually get done what they needed to do until another student had been shot. I don't believe that resulted in a fatality. But the difference between someone wounded and someone killed is frequently not something we can take a great deal of consolation in because that bullet could have been deadly.Another school superintendent reported to me that Federal law required him to return a disabled student to the classroom after the student threatened to shoot school employees.We have seen the tragic gruesome events in States close to Missouri, in schools in Jonesboro, AR, in Paducah, KY, and now in Littleton, CO. I don't want to see this happen in my home State of Missouri. I don't want to see these kinds of things happen anywhere.Again, I emphasize: We do not--I repeat ``do not''--know all of the facts of the Littleton incident. We do not know if they were special education students subject to the Federal IDEA laws or not. But we do know that this situation should prompt us to examine all of our Federal laws involving school safety.We have a massive tragedy waiting to happen if we have Federal rules and regulations which keep our school officials across America from being able to control schools, control students, and discipline students appropriately. We have a massive tragedy waiting to happen if we don't allow teachers and administrators to keep students who have guns from coming onto the campus and being on the campus.The provision that is in this measure, which I have had the privilege of sponsoring, ends one of these laws and helps protect our kids from gun violence in schools.The tragic events at schools across the nation in the last year or so say something very, very troubling about our culture.In Springfield, MO, which is my hometown--I grew up there, went through school grades 1 through 12 in Springfield--just hours after the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, the school board voted to approve arming its school district security guards with weapons. I am saddened that the board had to take this action. But it reflects the harsh reality of our culture today.I think all of us wonder why these incidents of violence happen. Children against children--what does it say about our culture?Have we developed a culture of violence which degrades the value of life?We wonder about the movies, movies and video games and music, the so-called gangster rap--I am not even sure how to label it--which talk about this kind of killing and suicide, and the disrespect for fellow students and fellow human beings.I think we need in our society to reexamine what our culture is teaching our children.What are we saying? What are we promoting with the death, with the violence, with the glorification of drugs in so much of the literature, and as a matter of fact, in much of the music?Parents need to be concerned.These aren't all things that government can have much to do about, but I think our parents need to be concerned about the level of exposure that our children have to things which degrade the appreciation for life and desensitize our feelings toward death.The joystick on a video game may punch out an opponent on the screen, and one might be able to kill, kill, kill, kill just by punching the button on the computer.I think we have to be careful that we don't create in ourselves the mentality of disrespect of what ought to be an appreciation for life, and desensitize our feelings.Obviously, Congress can't solve all the problems.,2015-03-17 19:11:24.276102,2015-03-17 19:11:24.276102,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT,1999-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-21/html/CREC-1999-04-21-pt1-PgS3984.htm,55,11,145,S3984-S4005,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2829,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you, Mr. President.I am grateful for the kind remarks of the Senator from Utah and am pleased to have the opportunity to work with him and the Senator from Vermont.I rise today to speak in favor of one of the most important pieces of technology legislation in the 105th Congress. At its heart, this legislation is about updating the copyright laws for the digital age and preparing a sizable portion of our economy for the next century.The affected parties include the online service providers, computer hardware and software manufacturers; every educator in America is affected by this legislation; every student; all the libraries; all the consumer electronics manufacturers and consumers of electronics; the motion picture companies, and everyone who uses the Internet. This measure will have as broad an impact on the American public as virtually any measure we will address.The full Senate's consideration of this bill culminates an effort of updating our copyright law that I began last September when I introduced S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act. S. 1146 was a comprehensive bill designed to jump-start a process that had ground to a halt and appeared to be going nowhere.The bill addresses three basic problems. First, the liability of online service providers for copyright violations; second, the need to update the provisions of the copyright law that affect educators and libraries for the digital age; and third--and not least, of course--the need to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, treaties.The United States of America, as the generator of so much content and material--the innovator, the creator of so much of what is copywritten--stands to gain most by making sure that our copyrights are respected worldwide.I am gratified that today the full Senate will vote on this bill that addresses all three of these concerns, especially the concerns regarding the need to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties which will provide that the United States effort to protect copyrights--the intellectual property of those who are the creators in this country and develop things in this country--those treaties will protect those copyrights.The original administration language that was introduced by Senators Hatch and Leahy focused exclusively on the WIPO treaties. However, through hard work, numerous amendments and the assistance of Senators Hatch and Leahy and their staffs--and this was really a cooperative effort--we were able to fashion a comprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws for the digital age.Many important changes were made to the bill, including amendments reinforcing on-line privacy rights, ensuring that the bill would not be read to mandate design decisions and addressing the need to update the copyright laws to permit distance education using digital technology.When I was a professor--I won't want to admit how long ago--I used to teach a television course. The very same procedures I used in analog technology for television transmission might well have been illegal if the TV signal had been transmitted digitally. It is important that we give the capacity for distance education in the digital age the same potential that we had for distance education in the analog age.I will focus on three important changes, one reflecting each of the three basic problems addressed by the original bill.First, there is the issue of the liability of on-line service providers. The notion that service providers should not bear the responsibility for copyright infringements when they are solely transmitting the material is one key to the future growth of the Internet. Now, what we are really talking about is if someone illegally transmits material on the Internet, the Internet companies that provide the opportunity for people to transmit the material shouldn't be held responsible any more than the phone company should be held responsible if you were to say something illegal over the phone, or that Xerox should be held responsible if you violate a copyright by illegally copying material on the Xerox machine.This is very important because of the way the Internet operates in terms of assembling and reassembling digital messages that they not be considered to be an illegal publisher; they, therefore, needed the protections that are provided in this bill so that we can have and continue to use the infrastructure of the Internet and allow it to operate effectively.Proper resolution of this issue is critical to unlock the potential for the Internet. For that reason, I included a title addressing on-line service provider liability in my legislation. Make no mistake about it, clarification of on-line service provider liability was one of my fundamental concerns in the debate, and after months of negotiations the affected parties were able to agree to legislative language that protects on-line service providers, or what we call the OSPs, from liability when they simply transmit--they are not involved, they don't have any interest in the message, but they are just transmitters. If there is a violation, it is not their fault that something was transmitted in contravention of the copyright law.Although I applauded the efforts of the affected industries to resolve the OSP liability issue, there was one issue which the industry agreement did not address--the protections that need to be given to users of the Internet. The agreement that the OSPs entered into would have protected the interests of the copyright owners, but it provided little or no protection for an Internet user who was wrongfully accused of violating copyright laws.I think of a little girl, perhaps, who puts on her Internet site the picture of a duck she draws. We shouldn't allow Disney to say, ``We own Donald Duck. That looks too much like Donald,'' and be able to bully a little girl from having a duck on her web site. We needed protection for the small user, not just for the big content promoters.Even though several Judiciary Committee members claimed no amendments were needed, I made sure that the industry compromise respected the rights of typical Internet users, ordinary people, by offering an amendment that provided a protection included in the original bill I had offered. It is an idea which is referred to as the ``notice and put-back'' provision. If material is wrongfully taken down from the Internet user's home page, my amendment ensures that the end user will be given notice of the action taken and gives them a right to initiate a process that allows them to put their material back on line without the need to hire a lawyer or go to court. This was a critical improvement over the industry's prior compromise agreement.A second concern of mine throughout this process has been the need to update protections for educators and libraries already included in the copyright law to reflect the digital technology. I have already mentioned that. Having been an individual who had the privilege of teaching a college course on television I knew just how important it would be for libraries and educational institutions to be able to use digital transmissions of documents and signals in the same way that they were authorized to do so with analog signals under our copyright law as it has existed.I did offer an amendment in committee, and it was unanimously incorporated into the bill, which will allow libraries to use digital technology for archiving and for interlibrary loans, for example. This will help libraries serve the American public.A final issue of profound importance, ensuring that the bill did not inadvertently make it a violation of the Federal law to be a good parent. The original bill or draft of this bill took such a broad approach to outlawing any devices that could be used to gain access to a copyrighted work that it may have made it illegal to manufacture and use devices that were designed to protect children from obscenities and pornography. An amendment I offered in committee makes it clear that a parent may protect his children from pornography without running afoul of this law. I think moms and dads will want to be able to protect their children and shouldn't have to risk running afoul of the law to do so. My own belief is that when moms and dads do their jobs, governing America will be easy. If moms and dads don't do their jobs, governing this country could be impossible. We need to make it possible for parents in every instance to do their job.The amendment recognizes that devices designed to allow such parental monitoring must be allowed. We should never allow any legislation to move forward that intentionally or unintentionally makes good parenting illegal. When the choice is between protecting our children from obscene material and perhaps allowing one machine to be diverted for unlawful use, Congress and the court should choose the protection of the children every time and then prosecute anyone who makes unlawful use of such machine.There are a number of individuals who deserve our specific thanks here, and I want to take the time to make sure that deserving individuals and organizations are thanked. I want to take a moment to thank a few particular staff members who labored into the night over and over again and through weekends to put together this legislation. I commend my colleagues Senators Hatch and Leahy. I want to say that a number of my concerns were accommodated because these members of the Leahy and Hatch staff were so hard-working. Ed Damich and Troy Dow with Senator Hatch were critical to moving forward on all issues, particularly by coordinating the OSP discussions.Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman of Senator Leahy's staff were similarly important to the process, particularly in regard to the education provisions and on drafting language for several key areas. I thank the staff. They worked very closely with two of the best staff members that I think work in any arena on Capitol Hill, and that is Bartlett Cleland of my staff and Paul Clement. They worked extremely hard with industry and with other Members of the Senate to craft a piece of legislation which I believe is going to be a tremendous asset in allowing the potential of the Internet to be realized.Finally, I want to thank all of the individuals representing various industry and education interests who were critical not only in educating me on the myriad of technical issues addressed in this legislation, but were helping in every way to reach agreement when the time came. In the end, this is perhaps not a perfect bill. I would have favored a different approach to some issues. But this is a bill that has become a comprehensive effort to bring the copyright law into the digital age. It is an important piece of legislation which we can work together to make work for America. Accordingly, I am happy to support this bill. I look forward to its final passage, with appreciation to the outstanding leadership of Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy in the committee. Working with them has been one of the most gratifying experiences of a process of reaching a conclusion on legislation which I think will advance our opportunity significantly to access the advantages of electronic and digital communication for the entirety of America.Mr. President, I want to go over some of these notions again and expand the ideas a bit further.I rise today to speak in favor of one of the most important pieces of technology legislation in the 105th congress. At its heart, this legislation is about updating the copyright laws for the digital age and preparing a sizable portion of our economy for the next century. The affected parties include the on-line service providers, computer hardware and software manufacturers, educators students, libraries, consumer electronics manufacturers and consumers, motion picture companies, and everyone who uses the Internet. The full Senate's consideration of this bill culminates an effort at updating our copyright law that I began last September when I introduced S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act. S. 1146 was a comprehensive bill designed to jump start a process that had ground to a halt and appeared to be going nowhere. The bill addressed three basic problems: (1) the liability of on-line service providers for copyright violations, (2) the need to update the provisions of the copyright law that affect educators and libraries for the digital age, and (3) the need to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, treaties. I am gratified that today the full Senate will vote on a bill that addresses all three of these concerns.The original Administration language that was introduced by Senators Hatch and Leahy focused exclusively on the WIPO Treaties. However, through hard work, numerous amendments, and the assistance of Senators Hatch and Leahy and their staffs, we were able to fashion a comprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws for the digital age.The bill before the Senate today now addresses all three of the basic problems identified in my bill. First, the notion that service providers should not bear the responsibility for copyright infringements when they are providing a means of communication is a key notion for the future growth and development of digital communications and most importantly the Internet. Resolution of this issue is critical for the future development of the Internet. For that reason, I included a title regarding on-line service provider liability in my legislation. After months of negotiations, the affected parties were able to agree to legislative language that protects on-line service providers, or OSPs, from liability when they simply transmit information along the Internet.The principles expressed in this legislation will provide a clear path for OSPs to operate without concern for legal ramifications or copyright infringement that may occur in the regular course of the operation of the Internet, or that occur without the OSPs knowledge. Without these issues being clearly delineated we would have faced a future of uncertainty regarding the growth of Internet and potentially whether it could have operated at all. Make no mistake that the clarification of on-line service provider liability was one of my fundamental concerns in this debate. While this was not the only crucial change in the legislation it is a change that I found essential for this legislation to even be considered, which is why Title I of my original legislation was devoted to clearly defining liability.Although I was supportive of the affected industries' efforts to resolve the OSP liability issues, there was one issue which the industry agreement did not address--what protections would be given the typical users of the Internet. The agreement protected the interests of OSPs, and it protected the interests of copyright owners, but it provided little or no protection for an Internet user wrongfully accused of violating the copyright laws.The original draft would have left these wrongly injured, innocent users with limited recourse. They would have to hire an attorney and go to court to have the court require the OSP and copyright holder to allow the web page to go back up--in other words the end user would have to go to court to prove their innocence. I found this situation to be totally unacceptable. Even though several Judiciary Committee members claimed that no amendments were needed I made sure that the industry compromise protected the rights of the typical Internet user by offering an amendment that provided protection included my original bill--an idea referred to as notice and put back. If material is wrongly taken down from an Internet user's home page because the original notice mistakenly did not take into account that the Internet user was only making a fair use of the copyrighted work, my amendment ensures that the end-user will be given notice of the action taken, and gives them a right to initiate a process that allows them to put their material back on-line, without the need to hire a lawyer and go to court. This was a critical improvement over the industry's compromise agreement.Another modification to the OSP liability material was to guarantee that companies, such as Yahoo!, could continue to operate as they have previous to the passage of this legislation. I admire companies that can succeed in the highly competitive technology sector, and Yahoo! has done just that. In no way should Congress discourage true entrepreneurship, particularly when the better ``mouse trap'' in this case has propelled a company to the top of its market. The safe harbor should not dissipate merely because a service provider viewed a particular online location during the course of categorization for a directory. If the rule were otherwise, true consumer oriented products would be eliminated or discouraged in the marketplace.Finally, I also insisted on language in the Committee role that recognized that the OSP liability provisions must be applied to educators and libraries with sensitivity to the special nature of those institutions and the unique relationships that exist in those settings. The report also makes it clear that the notice and put-back provision I mentioned above provides all the process that is due, so that state institutions need not worry about having to choose between qualifying for the safe harbors provided in the bill and the requirements imposed by the Due Process Clause.The second title of my original legislation was dedicated to similar concerns of universities, libraries, schools, educators and students, and ensured that these groups would not be left out when the content providers rushed to secure their position in the digital age. This legislation now includes some of the same provisions. I worked closely with Senator Leahy, educators, libraries and publishers to guarantee that libraries will be able to update their archives and provide materials to the public in a way that keeps pace with technology.Additionally, this legislation begins the process to allow distance education in the digital world. We should not tolerate laws that discriminate against technology, instead we should seek to guarantee that what people can do in the analog that they can continue those actions in the digital world. A study will be undertaken to help Congress to sort out the many technological and legal challenges of updating the copyright law regarding distance education. At the beginning of the next Congress I fully expect to introduce legislation specifically on distance education and I understand that both Senators Hatch and Leahy have agreed to support legislation based on the study conducted by the Copyright Office. In addition, I look forward to working with both the education community and the content community to pass, not block, this important legislation. Distance education is of fundamental importance to Missouri, as it is to most rural states, and of great importance to the many parents who home school their children.A third portion of the bill addresses the means by which the WIPO treaties will be implemented in the United States, also referred to as section 1201. This issue is of fundamental importance for a vital part of our nations economy. Piracy is a large and growing problem for many content providers, but particularly to our software industry. Billions of dollars in pirated material is lost every year and in impact is felt directly to our national bottom line.While the overall structure of the legislation in this part is not the way I would have approached the issue I believe that I have been given enough assurance both in legislative language and in legislative history that I can support the bill. I still find troubling any approach that makes technology the focus of illegality rather than the bad conduct of a bad actor, but with the accommodations that have been given I think that the bill is workable.One issue of profound importance to me was ensuring that parents continue to have the legal ability to be good parents. The original draft of this bill took such a broad approach to outlawing devices, that it may have inadvertently made it illegal to manufacture and use devices designed to protect children from on-line pornography. The bill, as amended recognizes that certain devices--such as devices that allow parents to protect their children from on-line pornography--must be allowed. An amendment I offered in Committee makes clear that a parent may protect their children from pornography without running afoul of this law. We should never be in the position with any legislation that intentionally or unintentionally makes good parenting illegal. When the choice is between protecting our children from obscene material and perhaps allowing one machine to be diverted for unlawful use, Congress and the courts should choose the protection of children every time.Additionally, the protection of privacy remains a concern. While the legislation makes some effort to make clear that a person acting to protect their individual privacy should not be liable for or guilty of circumvention some further clarification is needed. One of my primary concerns has been the use of ``cookies'' and their detrimental impact for on-line privacy. I am not convinced that cookies could not be copyrighted and protected in such a way that getting rid of them or turning them off would not violate the new law. Recently my concern has been proven further by a piece of software developed by Blizzard Entertainment called StarCraft. This software rifles through the player's hard drives and sends the information found back to the company. Again, I was told by some that I should not be concerned, but I will tell you that I am concerned and everyone in this body and in the country should have similar concerns about this or any legislation that without careful thought could create a situation where an individual's privacy is jeopardized. I believe the savings clause I added to the bill will address this problem. However, if that does not prove sufficient, I will introduce legislation to deal with this problem directly and will look forward to working with all the parties that support this bill to ensure passage of such legislation.One industry that has concerns about this legislation is the encryption industry. I sought to have included in the legislative language a provision to guarantee that the highly successful means for encryption research that are used in this country may continue to be used in the future, despite some of the prohibitions included in this bill. Unfortunately, we were not able to work out any acceptable legislative language. We were able to craft language for the report that made clear that most forms of current encryption research were left undisturbed by the bill. While I believe that this is better than nothing, I understand that there are lingering concerns, and I would certainly support efforts to try to address this issue before the House completes work on this important piece of legislation.In discussing the anti-circumvention portion of the legislation, I think it is worth emphasizing that I could agree to support the bill's approach of outlawing certain devices because I was repeatedly assured that the device prohibitions in 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) are aimed at so-called ``black boxes'' and not at legitimate consumer electronics and computer products that have substantial non-infringing uses. I specifically worked for and achieved changes to the bill to make sure that no court would misinterpret this bill as outlawing legitimate consumer electronics devices or computer hardware. As a result, neither section 1201(a)(2) nor section 1201(b) should be read as outlawing any device with substantial non-infringing uses, as per the tests provided in those sections.If history is a guide, however, someone may yet try to use this bill as a basis for initiating litigation to stop legitimate new products from coming to market. By proposing the addition of section 1201(d)(2) and (3), I have sought to make clear that any such effort to use the courts to block the introduction of new technology should be bound to fail.As my colleagues may recall, this wouldn't be the first time someone has tried to stop the advance of new technology. In the mid 1970s, for example, a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block the introduction of the Betamax video recorder. I think it useful to recall what the Supreme Court had to say in ruling for consumers and against two movie studies in that case:One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of the millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program for later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copying possible.As Missouri's Attorney General, I had the privilege to file a brief in the Supreme Court in support of the right of consumers to buy that first generation of VCRs. I want to make it clear that I did not come to Washington to vote for a bill that could be used to ban the next generation of recording equipment. I want to reassure consumers that nothing in the bill should be read to make it unlawful to produce and use the next generation of computers or VCRs or whatever future device will render one or the other of these familiar devices obsolete.Another important amendment was added that makes clear that this law does not mandate any particular selection of components for the design of any technology. I was concerned that this legislation could be interpreted as a mandate on product manufacturers to design products so as to respond affirmatively to effective technical protection measures available in the marketplace. In response to this concern I was pleased to offer an amendment, with the support of both the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Committee, to avoid the unintended effect of having design requirements imposed on product and component manufacturers, which would have a dampening effect on innovation, and on the research and development of new products. Accordingly, my amendment clarified that product designers need not design consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing products, nor design and select parts or components for such products, in order to respond to particular technological protection measures.This amendment reflects my belief that product manufacturers should remain free to design and produce consumer electronics, telecommunications and computing products without the threat of incurring liability for their design decisions under this legislation. Nothing could cause greater disaster and a swifter downfall of our vibrant technology sector than to have the federal government dictating the design of computer chips or mother boards. By way of example, during the course of our deliberations, we were made aware of certain video boards used in personal computers in order to allow consumers to receive television signals on their computer monitors which, in order to transform the television signal from a TV signal to one capable of display on a computer monitor, remove attributes of the original signal that may be associated with certain copy control technologies. I am acutely aware of this particular example because I have one of these video boards on my own computer back in my office. It is quite useful as it allows me to monitor the Senate floor, and occasionally ESPN on those rare occasions when the Senate is not in session. My amendment makes it clear that this legislation does not require that such transformations, which are part of the normal conversion process rather than affirmative attempts to remove or circumvent copy control technologies, fall within the proscriptions of chapter 12 of the copyright law as added by this bill.Further, concerns were voiced during the Committee's deliberations that because 1201 applies not only to devices but to parts and components of devices, it could be interpreted broadly to sweep in legitimate products such as personal computers and accessories and video and audio recording devices. While the manufacturers of these products were understandably concerned, it was quite apparent to me that it was not the Committee's intention that such useful multipurpose articles of commerce be prohibited by 1201 on the basis that they may have particular parts or components that might, if evaluated separately from such products, fall within the proscriptions of 1201(a)(2) or (b). My amendment adding sections 1201(d)(2) and (3) was intended to address these concerns.Another issue of concern is that unless product designers are adequately consulted on the design and implementation of technological protection measures and means of preserving copyright management information, such measures may have noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the authorized display or performance of works. Under such circumstances, certain adjustments to specific products may become necessary after sale to a consumer to maintain the normal, authorized functioning of such products. Such adjustments, when made solely to mitigate the adverse effects of the measure on the normal, authorized operation of a manufacturer's product, device, component, or part thereof, would not, in my view, constitute conduct that would fall within the proscriptions of this legislation.The problems described may occur at a more fundamental level--with noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal operation of products that are being manufactured and sold to consumers. The best way to avoid this problem is for companies and industries to work together to seek to avoid such problems to the maximum extent possible. I am pleased to note that multi-industry efforts to develop copy control technologies that are both effective and avoid such noticeable and recurring adverse effects have been underway over the past two years in relation to certain copy protection measures. I join my colleagues in strongly encouraging the continuation of these efforts, since, in my view, they offer substantial benefits to copyright owners who add so much to the economy and who obviously want devices that do not interfere with the other normal operations of affected products.The truth of the matter is that Congress ought to operate contemporaneously with industry to solve problems. Anytime the affected industries beat government to the solution they ought to be praised. In many respects I invite the private sector to be there first and get it done well. If they are there first, they will often solve the problem. Even when they cannot solve the problem, the private sector problem solving process will at least narrow the issues for the government to address. Getting a law passed is very difficult, getting it changed is sometimes even more difficult, and so relying on government really elevates the need to have no garbage in, to result in the right output.I would encourage the content community and the device and hardware manufacturers to work together to avoid situations in which effective technological measures and copyright management information affect display quality. There is no reason why the interested parties cannot resolve these issues to ensure both optimal protection of content and optimal picture quality. To the extent that a particular technological protection measure or means of applying or embedding copyright management information to or in a work is designed and deployed into the marketplace without adequate consultation with potentially affected manufacturers, the proprietor of such a measure or means and those copyright owners using it must be aware that product adjustments by a manufacturer to avoid noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal, authorized operation of affected products are foreseeable, legitimate and commercially necessary. Such actions by manufacturers may not, therefore, be proscribed by this chapter.Again, several individuals and organizations deserve thanks from everyone involved in this debate. I want to take a moment to thank those few particular staff who labored into the night and over weekends to put together this legislation and to accommodate some of my concerns. Ed Damich and Troy Dow with Senator Hatch's office were critical to moving forward on all issues particularly by coordinating the OSP discussions. Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman were similarly important to the process particularly in regards to the education provisions and on drafting language for several key areas. I would like to thank all of the individuals representing various industry and educational interests who were critical not only in educating me on the myriad issues but also on copyright law in general. Finally, I would again like to thank the members of my own staff, Bartlett Cleland and Paul Clement who worked so well to produce a piece of legislation that could guide this country to a digital future.In the end, this is not a perfect bill. I would have favored a different approach to some issues. However, this bill is an important step forward in bringing the copyright law into the digital age. I am happy to support this bill and look forward to its final passage.,2015-03-17 19:11:24.569309,2015-03-17 19:11:24.569309,Senate,DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1998,1998-05-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-14/html/CREC-1998-05-14-pt1-PgS4884.htm,61,36,144,S4884-S4900,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2830,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, May 17, 2004 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark ``Brown v. Topeka Board of Education'' decision ordering the desegregation of U.S. schools. This court ruling effectively denied the legal basis for segregation in Kansas and 20 other States with segregated schools and forever changed race relations in the United States. Brown v. Board laid the precedent for ending all segregation. Very few Supreme Court decisions have impacted our nation's history as much as Brown v. Board.This important anniversary was celebrated in Topeka, Kansas with the formal opening of a new national park--the Brown v. Board National Historic Site at Topeka's once-segregated Monroe Elementary School. In conjunction with the fiftieth anniversary celebrations, Washburn University hosted an interdisciplinary academic conference, ``Telling the Story: Narrating Brown v. Board,'' May 18-20, 2004, and invited proposals for twenty-minute paper presentations on the full range of themes suggested by the Brown decision. Professor of History, Philip A. Grant, Jr. of Pace University was accepted to deliver his paper entitled ``Midwestern Press Reactions to the 1954 `Brown' Decision,'' at the conference ``Telling the Story: Narrating Brown v. Board'' at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas on May 19, 2004.Since the Supreme Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and declared an end to legal segregation, this country has made great progress, especially in the area of racial relations, but there is more work to be done. In order for us to continue to make this country a better place in which to live, we must remember the past. I believe that Professor Grant has brought to light the importance of Brown v. Board as seen by newspapers of the Midwest at the time of the decision. I ask that his entire paper be made a part of the Record so that all the American people, not just those who attended the conference last month, may have the benefit of his historical insight. [Paper recited at the ``Telling the Story: Narrating Brown v. Board'' conference at Washburn University, May 19, 2004]On May 17, 1954 the United States Supreme Court issued its historic ``Brown v. Board of Education'' decision. In a unanimous opinion the nation's highest tribunal decreed segregation in public elementary and secondary schools unconstitutional. By every standard the ``Brown'' ruling ranked as one of the most significant developments in the long and eventful history of our federal court system. Indeed there is ample evidence to warrant the conclusion that the ``Brown'' decision generated more controversy than any previous Supreme Court verdict. The ``Brown'' decision attracted prime news coverage throughout the Midwest, a twelve state region extending from Lake Erie in northeastern Ohio to the Kansas-Colorado line more than thirteen hundred miles to the West. Moreover, a substantial majority of midwestern newspapers opted to editorialize on the ``Brown'' ruling. Among the daily publications printing editorials on the ``Brown'' decision were the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Cincinnati Enquirer, Detroit Free Press, Indianapolis Star, Chicago Tribune, Milwaukee Journal, Saint Louis Post- Dispatch, Kansas City Star, Des Moines Register, and Minneapolis Tribune. These newspapers circulated in ten of the Midwest's major population centers. The Plain Dealer asserted that for a number of states ``a greater challenge in the form of `thall shall not' could hardly have been issued than the Supreme Court ruling against Negro segregation in public schools.'' Convinced that the Supreme Court ``could not have ruled otherwise than it did on the basic issue,'' the Plain Dealer believed that the Negroes had ``earned the right to be treated as first-class citizens and earned it the hard way.'' Perceiving that the ``Brown'' decision ``probably will prove to be the most important judicial finding in the field of racial relations in our entire national history,'' the Enquirer ascertained that it would ``work profound changes in a substantial part of the United States--not confined to the South by any means.'' The Cincinnati newspaper concluded: ``What the justices have done is simply to act as the conscience of the American nation.'' The Free Press, definitely endorsing the thrust of the ``Brown'' decision, claimed that the people of the country ``who cherish the belief that the American system of democracy is a vital, living organic philosophy, steadily but inexorably, advancing toward the ideals of the founders of the Union, will be heartened by the unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court.'' While conceding that the ``Brown'' ruling would ``not of itself abolish prejudice nor raise all Americans to the exalter status of men created in the image of their maker,'' the Free Press maintained: ``But it does mark a step in that direction, a step toward fulfillment of man's dream that all men are created equal, and that under a more perfect government of laws they can attain to dignity and all its inherent rights.'' Extolling the Supreme Court for having upheld ``a vital principle of individual equality under the law,'' the Star argued that segregation was ``morally, practically and economically evil'' and denied ``the brotherhood of man upon which our whole form of constitutional government is based.'' While concerned that no provision of the Constitution granted the federal courts ``the right to establish or control educational systems,'' the Star contended: ``Morally, we believe the Supreme Court was right in calling for an end to segregation. It is fortunate that this decision was unanimous for the full authority of the court will carry great weight with the Southern states, who now oppose its view. We hope the states opposing this ruling will accept it in good spirit and earnestly try to meet its demands. We hope Federal authorities will give the states time, and sympathetic assistance in making this conversion. And we hope that any demagogue, white or colored, who tries to inflame public opinion by using this explosive issue will be properly rebuffed by the overwhelming majority of the good people in our states.'' While admitting that it was doubtful whether the South would abide by the court's decision, the Tribune was optimistic that the unanimous ruling ``should help a good deal to discourage resistance to the finding or attempts to evade its plain meaning.'' The Tribune, commending the Supreme Court for having ``struck down segregation in the public schools of the United States,'' declared: ``The principle established by this decision is not that anybody has to give up any of his prejudices, no matter how desirable it might be that he do so. The principle is the much simpler one that the state governments, north and south, must regard all men as created equal so far as opportunities at the disposal of the state are concerned. The idea may appear dangerously novel to some citizens, but the Supreme Court didn't invent it. Indeed, they can be said to have borrowed it from a distinguished Virginian named Thomas Jefferson.'' The Journal, analyzing the ``Brown'' ruling as the ``most far reaching court decision on the racial issue since emancipation,'' anticipated that the decision would ``revolutionize the school set-up in the South and, in effect, the racial relationships there are bound to be felt outside the classrooms.'' Surmising that the consequences of the ``Brown'' verdict would impact the entire country, the Journal stated: ``. . . It apparently knocked the last legal prop from any official discrimination against Negroes or other minority groups because of color, race or religion. It banishes any legal recognition of second class citizenship for the members of such groups.'' Impressed that the ``Brown'' ruling was unanimous and written in direct and persuasive language, the Milwaukee newspaper was pleased that there ``could be no doubt about the intent or the logic and reasoning supporting the decision.'' Feeling that there was ``no need to say just how important'' the ``Brown'' ruling was, the Post-Dispatch also emphasized that there was ``no point in explaining it today as the most momentous since the Dred Scott decision handed down almost a century ago, on the eve of the Civil War.'' The Post-Dispatch, pointing out that the substance of the ``Brown'' verdict was of ``transcendent importance,'' predicted that the decision would have its ``impact in one way or another on every community, in every city'' and ``in less time than we are apt to think around the world.'' The Star, recognizing that the ``Brown'' decision ``sets the goal'' of ending racial segregation in all public schools, stressed that the principle involved in the Supreme Court ruling ``now controls for the future'' and ``is the law of the land.'' Warning that there ``can be no cheating or blocking'' the objective proclaimed by the Supreme Court, the Star offered the following appraisal: ``The breakdown in segregation since World War II has come a step at a time and generally without friction. The Supreme Court's ruling basically is no more drastic than the trend of our times that produced it. Now that the principle is established the future calls for more of the good sense and understanding of racial problems that has generally prevailed.'' Praising the Supreme Court for having ``begun the erasure of one of American democracy's blackest marks,'' the Register rejoiced that the nation's ``basic law on public education has been brought into line with the ringing spirit of freedom and equality in the Declaration of Independence.'' While gratified that the ``Brown'' decision decreed that racial segregation constituted a denial of equal educational opportunities, the Register asserted: ``The Supreme Court decision will ease America's conscience. The strong cry of `hypocrite' from colored folks all over the world has been heard in Des Moines and in Mobile. But America's conscience will not be cleared until her practice measures up to the noble words of the court decision.'' The Tribune, sensing that the ``Brown'' ruling would ``be welcomed and embraced by all who believe in the constitutional guarantee of equal rights meaning just that, and nothing less,'' suspected that the decision would ``echo far beyond our borders and may greatly influence our relations with dark-skinned people the world over.'' Concerned that the ``Brown'' verdict posed ``one troublesome immediate question,'' the Tribune asked: ``What will be done in the southern states where political leaders have been most militant in opposing the end of segregation?'' While wondering whether the political spokesmen of the South would ``persist in their attitudes,'' the Minneapolis newspaper was ``inclined toward the optimistic view.'' There was a consensus within the ranks of the major newspapers of the Midwest that the Supreme Court had acted wisely and responsibly in issuing the historic ``Brown'' ruling. While newspapers tended to analyze the ``Brown'' decision from somewhat different perspectives, they all agreed that the objective proposed by the Supreme Court was entirely consistent with the nation's long overdue quest for racial equality. In expressing their attitudes on an issue of overriding importance the daily publications of the Midwest were contributing to a dialogue with their readers and historians of the future.,2015-03-17 19:11:24.883533,2015-03-17 19:11:24.883533,Extensions,FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V.

2831,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge the House Republican leadership to address people's serious economic concerns. Today we awoke to reports on the radio which said that the front pages of major newspapers were dominated by the failed performance of our stock market.Mr. Speaker, our Nation needs an economic plan that will address some of the challenges we face today, like restoring economic growth and opportunity. While the economy is crashing around us, the House Republican leadership continues to answer by passing more tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and legislation that blames their failure to act on the other body. At a time of mounting economic pain, Republicans have ignored the people's priorities, from investor rights to Social Security, prescription drugs to education, to economic growth.The Census Bureau reported this week that in the last year, the number of people without health insurance rose by 1.4 million due to a faltering economy and the rise in unemployment. Republicans will pass this week another non-sense of the House resolution calling for tax cuts 9 years from now, in 2011. CNN reported this week that U.S. stocks, and I quote, looked to wrap up what might be the worst September since the Great Depression and had their worst third quarter since 1987.In a few days Americans will start receiving 401(k) statements showing another drop, a sharp drop, in their retirement savings. Senate Democrats will attempt to extend unemployment benefits today to 1.1 million people whose benefits have been exhausted, which is the right and responsible thing to do.Today is the first day of the new fiscal year, yet as a result of their failed economic program, the Republicans have been unable to carry out their most fundamental responsibility by passing necessary budget bills. So they will have to bring to the floor this week a second continuing resolution in as many weeks to keep the government simply operating. Their failed economic plan now threatens to cut back resources for the Securities and Exchange Commission, cut back on medical expenses for the Veterans Affairs Department, cut back education, and cut back on front-line resources for homeland defense.Last week I discussed on this floor this bankrupt economic agenda embraced by the House Republican leadership. Today let me discuss some basic facts about our Nation's economic future. In order to make progress for all Americans, we need to understand the results that the Democratic budget produced in 1993 versus the Republican economic plan that was passed in 2001. In 1993, the House of Representatives had an impassioned debate about America's economic future. Republicans predicted then that the Democratic economic plan to cut deficits and grow the economy would drive our economy into a ditch.If you look at this chart, Mr. Armey on August 5, 1993, said that ``this Democratic plan is not a recipe for new jobs. It is a recipe for disaster.'' On another chart, Mr. DeLay said that ``this plan has got to be the biggest rip-off in modern history.'' Finally, on another chart, Mr. Hastert predicted that ``the Democratic plan would add more than $2 trillion to the national debt.''The House Republican leadership could not have been more wrong about that Democratic economic agenda to secure the future for all Americans. In the 2 years after Democrats enacted this plan, the unemployment rate dropped by almost 2 percent. Real incomes after inflation for average families increased by more than 10 percent. We created more than 8 million jobs. The poverty rate came down. The stock market shot up. The Federal budget deficit was reduced by $126 billion in just 2 years' time and became a surplus within 5 years. Our economic plan defeated the 1991 recession, and the lives of almost every American citizen were improved due in large part to this responsible economic agenda promoting opportunity in people's lives.Deficits came down; interest rates came down. The American people created a high-tech revolution that raised living standards and inspired hope in communities nationwide.Under the Democratic plan, the facts speak for themselves. People created opportunity for themselves, their families, and they created opportunity for their fellow Americans. For almost 8 years we had record economic prosperity due to responsible economic policies that Democrats enacted.Then, in the spring of 2001, the Republican economic plan passed the Republican House, the then-Republican Senate; and the Republican President signed it into law. But I would like to point to some other statements that were made at the time.The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), on this chart, on March 28, 2001, said that the President's budget will spur job creation. Again on the chart, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts) boasted that their budget not only provides tax relief, but secures jobs and grows the economy. But he said, we also fund our Nation's priorities and pay down the debt. Finally, the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), said that the plan will promote economic growth, a strong economy, and new and better jobs for our workers.So the question now is, Where are we today? Did the predictions come true? Well, today, 18 months after these big and bold predictions, the Nation's economy and all of the economic indicators have headed south. The stock market has lost $4.5 trillion since President Bush took office.If we look at this chart, over 2 million people have lost their jobs since President Bush took office and the economic plan was passed. Income for American families in middle-income brackets has declined 2.2 percent since the Republicans took office and, last week, for the first time in 8 years, the poverty rate in our country went up again. Consumer confidence has dropped in each of the last 4 months and is at the lowest level since November 2001. The Federal budget, in just over a year, went from a $236 billion surplus to a $165 billion deficit. That is over a $300 billion swing, almost $400 billion. And if we look at this chart, turned record surpluses into deficits for the decade ahead. An amazing, unbelievable, incomprehensible change in our economic budget health.A wave of corporate scandals has eroded people's faith and trust in our Nation's free markets. As Ronald Brownstein wrote yesterday in the Los Angeles Times, he said, ``Almost all of the key measures of economic well-being for average families improved during Bill Clinton's 8 years in the White House and now, under the second President Bush, the trend lines are pointing down again.''This is a Republican group that has been wrong, and I mean dead wrong, twice. They were wrong about the Democratic plan in 1993, and they were again wrong when they talked about their own plan more than a year ago.Today, they have an opportunity to sit down with Democrats and write a new economic plan in a bipartisan way that would create long-term economic growth and opportunity for all Americans. But to date, they refuse to reconsider any aspect of a plan that was passed long before September 11, 2001. In fact, what they are doing today is simply keeping on passing bills to make their failed economic plan permanent. I guess the byline here is if it is bad and not working, let us make it permanent. Let us rigidly, tenaciously hold on to what is not working, so that it can continue to not work.The sole passion of House Republicans has been to reward their wealthy political clientele for the next decade and beyond at the expense of every need of the American people. They are content wasting the people's time with ridiculous, nonbinding House resolutions when they have at least 20 major economic issues to address that might and would affect people's lives in a positive way.Where is the debate on the future of Social Security? Where is the minimum wage increase legislation? Where is education funding so that we really leave no child behind? Where is the real pension legislation so that we protect people's pensions against corporate misbehavior? Where is the real prescription drug legislation that will actually at least get the price down for people's prescriptions? Where is the health care and Medicare-buttressing legislation?Well, I will tell my colleagues where it all is. It is nowhere. They have nothing better to do. They cannot finish the budget. They have put nothing substantial on the floor since the August recess. We have been here 3 days a week doing nothing but renaming post offices. We are fiddling while America's economy implodes around the American people's ears.Mr. Speaker, I think it is time to wake up and address the most important problems that we face. Let us come together on a new budget for America, a new economic plan for America, and let us stop talking about meaningless nonsense resolutions about something that might or might not happen 10 years from now. The American people are living in today and tomorrow. They are not waiting for what might or might not happen 10 years from now. Let us stop the meaningless nonsense resolutions when we ought to be dealing with the American people's important problems today.,2015-03-17 19:11:25.121701,2015-03-17 19:11:25.121701,House,THE NATIONAL ECONOMY,2002-10-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-10-01/html/CREC-2002-10-01-pt1-PgH6786.htm,126,1,148,H6786-H6787,G000132,mr. gephardt
2832,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Children's Health Act of 2000 that will pass the Senate today. This legislation is the result of months of dedicated work by a number of Senators and House members. I believe the final language represents a comprehensive approach to promote physical and mental health for children, and protect them from dangerous, illegal drugs. I am a co-sponsor of the Senate version of this bill, a previous Senate version of the Children's Health Act (S. 2868), as well as the author of two key provisions contained in the package we are considering today.I rise today to speak in favor of this legislation and to thank the bill's sponsor, Senator Frist, for working with me to include two provisions that I believe are essential tools for advancing health and safety of America's children. The bill that will pass today, H.R. 4365, contains three main sections: (1) the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, a bill I introduced last year that previously passed the Senate and has been approved by the House Judiciary Committee for consideration by the House of Representatives; (2) the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which reauthorizes programs within the jurisdiction of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to improve mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents and allows the Charitable Choice concept, which I first authored in the 104th Congress, to be applied to the programs covered by this Act and (3) the Children's Health Act, which amends the Public Health Services Act to revise, extend, and establish programs with respect to children's health research, health promotion and disease prevention activities conducted through Federal public health agencies.Mr. President, let me touch briefly on each of these three main sections.First, this bill includes the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, a bill I introduced in February 25, 1999 in response to the growing problem of methamphetamine production and use in my home state of Missouri, throughout the Midwest and in many other states as well. Unfortunately, the problem of methamphetamine has only gotten worse in the past year and a half. This anti-meth measure I authored will help fight meth in Missouri and the U.S. with $55 million in new resources for enforcement, cleanup, school- and community-based prevention efforts, and rehabilitation services.The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act will bolster the fight against meth through stiffer penalties for drug criminals; more money for law enforcement, education, and prevention; and a wider ban on meth paraphernalia. The bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to raise its guidelines for sentencing meth offenders. It requires mandatory reimbursement for the costs incurred by federal, state and local governments for the cleanup associated with meth labs. It authorizes $5.5 million in funding for DEA programs to train State and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth investigations and staff mobile training teams which provide State and local law enforcement with advanced training in conducting lab investigations. It also provides $15 million in funding to combat the trafficking of meth in counties designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.This legislation also provides for further research into the use of meth; authorizes $15 million in funds for community- and school-based anti-meth education programs; and includes an additional $10 million in resources for treatment of meth addiction. It directs HHS to include its annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse prevalence data on the consumption of methamphetamine and other illicit drugs in rural, metropolitan, and consolidated metropolitan areas and requires the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Institute of Medicine, to conduct a study on the development of medications for the treatment of addiction to methamphetamine.The nation's lead anti-drug agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), has thrown its support behind the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act. In endorsing this bill, DEA Administrator Donnie Marshall said this bill is ``landmark methamphetamine legislation.'' Marshall stated: ``I believe this bill (the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act) will prove instrumental in the Drug Enforcement Administration's efforts to bring to a halt the continued spread of methamphetamine across our country.''Mr. President, I am sad that Missouri is notorious as a national center of meth production and distribution. Methamphetamine, for those who are lucky enough not to have a meth problem in their areas, is a highly addictive synthetic drug that is typically made in illegal clandestine ``labs.'' Missouri and California lead the nation in seizures of such labs. In Missouri, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and state and local law enforcement officers seized only two such labs in 1992, 14 in 1994, and a record 679 in 1998. This number jumped to 920 in 1999, setting a new record.The second section of this bill is the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This section addresses the issue of drug abuse in our nation's youth which has dramatically increased this decade. It creates new programs to provide additional funding for youth-targeted treatment and early intervention services. Under this bill, states will receive more flexibility in the use of block grant funds and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will have more flexibility to respond to the needs of young people who need mental health and substance abuse services.I am especially pleased that included in the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act is an expansion of the Charitable Choice provision, which will allow federally-funded substance abuse services to be open to faith-based providers. Under Charitable Choice, which was first enacted into law in 1996 as part of the welfare reform law, churches and other faith-based providers are able to compete on an equal footing with other non-governmental organizations in providing services to disadvantaged Americans.Since its enactment, Charitable Choice has been expanded from job training and related services for welfare clients to include the Community Services Block Grant program, which is used for a variety of anti-poverty activities, such as improving job and educational opportunities and providing financial management and emergency assistance. This latest expansion will apply Charitable Choice to federal drug treatment programs that will total $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. My home state of Missouri is slated to receive $24.46 million in substance abuse block grant funding for the coming fiscal year.Charitable Choice calls our nation to its highest and best in our effort to help those in need. It meets the tests of compassion and common sense that count for so much in Missouri. When people of faith extend compassionate help to those in need, the results can be stunningly successful. Where too many traditional substance abuse treatment programs have failed to help those in need, faith-based programs have succeeded. For example, Teen Challenge has show that 86% of its graduates remain drug-free. San Antonio's Victory Fellowship boasts of a success rate of over 80%. This is the test of common sense: America needs to create a vibrant partnership that succeeds where other approaches have failed.Mr. President, the bipartisan support for Charitable Choice is overwhelming in Congress. In additional, both Presidential candidates--Governor Bush and Vice President Gore--strongly support the program. It is my hope that this broad national consensus will continue to grow and that soon will be able to enact a comprehensive expansion of Charitable Choice to all federally-funded social services programs.Third, the Children's Public Health Act has four overriding themes represented in its four titles: Injury Prevention, Maternal and Infant Health, Pediatric Health Promotion, and Pediatric Research. This legislation focuses federal research efforts in these areas and provides a comprehensive approach to children's health. For example, the bill includes authorization for research to prevent traumatic brain injuries, provides federal grants for comprehensive asthma services to children, and establishes a National Center for Birth Defects and Development Disabilities within the CDC. The bill also includes childhood obesity prevention programs, childhood lead prevention programs, and a groundbreaking pediatric research initiative within NIH to ensure the realization of expanding opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations and care for children. This legislation also includes support for pediatric graduate medical education in children's hospitals, an issue that has been a high priority of mine for years.I am hopeful, that with passage of this landmark legislation, we can improve the lives of America's children. By funding research for many childhood diseases and disabilities, expanding programs to assist youth with addiction and mental health problems through faith-based providers, and drastically increasing the war against meth, this bill is an important step in the right direction. I thank all those who worked on this legislation, and urge the President to sign this bill to help secure a safer and healthier future for the next generation.,2015-03-17 19:11:25.343859,2015-03-17 19:11:25.343859,Senate,CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000,2000-09-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-22/html/CREC-2000-09-22-pt1-PgS9094.htm,114,31,146,S9094-S9116,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2833,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. I introduce this on behalf of myself, Senators Lott, Daschle, Hollings, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Cochran, Kohl, Inouye, Moynihan, Chafee, and Breaux.The March of Dimes and their volunteers are here today to lend support to an often overlooked, but a very compelling health care problem in the United States today. Many people do not realize that birth defects are the leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a serious birth defect, and one out of every five of these babies will die. Nationally, birth defects affect 3 percent of all births, and among the babies who survive, birth defects are a significant cause of lifelong disability. Depending on the particular type of problem and its severity, special medical treatment, education, rehabilitation and other services may be required into adulthood, costing billions of dollars each year.A 1995 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report revealed that the lifetime cost for just 18 common birth defects occurring in a single year is $8 billion. Yet, only about 22 percent of those born with birth defects are included in these figures. And, of course, it is impossible to measure the pain and the heartache that birth defects cause.Let me share with you just a couple of experiences I have had in Missouri. I have worked for a long time to improve children's health. I appropriated money in the early 1970's in Missouri to fund the high-cost, but highly effective, neonatal care units at our hospitals. They do a wonderful job of saving very-low-birth-weight babies and babies with severe defects. But that is not enough. We can do some things to lower the incidence of birth defects, and birth defects can strike any family.I know, many people say one of the real problems is we have too many young women, often unmarried, who do not know that you cannot use tobacco or alcohol or drugs during pregnancy without expecting a bad birth outcome.But there are many other things that we have only recently learned that are extremely important. Four hundred milligrams a day of folic acid, vitamin B, for women of childbearing years can substantially reduce the risk of a child born with spina bifida. A very good friend of ours had a child born with spina bifida. He was a wonderful young man, but he has had to go through many expensive operations. His parents went through much heartache, and he still is not able to move as the rest of us can.Birth defects can be dealt with if we have a concerted national strategy to direct the Centers for Disease Control to collect the information on birth defects, to provide funding and support in research at the State level and to set up five regional centers to deal with birth defects. A few years ago, the incidence of birth defects became a very major concern in certain Hispanic communities in southwest Texas, and, as a result, the Hispanic caucus joined with me in past years, in past sessions of Congress, to sponsor this legislation.We were able to appropriate some moneys for the Centers for Disease Control, but we have not been able to establish a national strategy, maybe because there are not lobbyists for those who have not yet been born who may be at risk of birth defects, but there are effective spokespeople, like the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and a long list of distinguished organizations.The time has come to join with them, with the Easter Seals Society, the American Hospital Association, and all of the other organizations, in developing and directing the Centers for Disease Control to work with States and local governments to survey birth defects, to bring together the information on birth defects so that researchers have a means of dealing with it.Mr. President, birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States. This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a serious birth defect, and 1 out of every 5 of these babies will die.In addition, birth defects affect 3 percent of all births nationally.Among babies who survive, birth defects are a significant cause of lifelong disability. Depending on the particular type of problem and its severity, special medical treatment, education, rehabilitation, and other services may be required into adulthood--costing billions of dollars each year.A 1995 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report revealed that the lifetime cost for just 18 common birth defects occurring in a single year is $8 billion--yet only about 22 percent of those born with birth defects are included in these figures.And, of course, it is impossible to measure the pain and heartache that birth defects cause.It may surprise you to learn that the United States does not have a coordinated strategy for reducing the incidence of birth defects. It is both shocking and disappointing how few Federal resources are devoted to prevent this tragic, perhaps even partly preventable public health problem.So today, in an effort to tackle this devastating problem head on, I am introducing the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. Congressmen Solomon Ortiz and Henry Bonilla are simultaneously introducing this bill in the House of Representatives.This bill will prioritize our efforts and make congressional intent clear--more resources should be directed to the prevention of the leading killer of babies, birth defects.An unfortunate situation in the State of Texas a few years ago exemplifies how the lack of a birth defects prevention strategy delayed the response to an outbreak of birth defects and may have needlessly cost innocent lives. Health professionals in Texas observed that six infants were born with anencephaly over a 6-week period. Anencephaly is a fetal birth defect characterized by an absence of brain tissue.The Texas Department of Health conducted a study after this information was reported. The study revealed that since 1989, at least 30 infants in south Texas had been born without or with little brain tissue. However, because Texas did not have a birth defects surveillance program, the severity of the problem was not recognized until the incidence of anencephaly was so high that it was difficult to miss.This tragic event in south Texas underscores the need for a coordinated national effort to research the causes of birth defects and to prevent such defects from occurring in the first place. A little prevention goes a long way in preventing family pain and heartache. It is up to our Nation to seize on this excellent opportunity to protect our most vulnerable resources--our children.To achieve the goal of protecting our Nation's kids, this legislation does several things.First, the bill provides Federal grants to State health authorities for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and reporting birth defects statistics. Today, only about half of the States have some kind of birth defects surveillance system.Second, this legislation calls for the establishment of at least five regional centers of birth defects prevention research. These regional programs will collect and analyze information on the number, incidence, and causes of birth defects within a region as well as provide education and training for health professionals aimed at the prevention of birth defects.At least one of the centers will focus on birth defects among ethnic minorities.Third, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is directed to be the coordinating agency for birth defects prevention activities. The CDC will serve as a clearinghouse for the collection and storage of data generated from State and regional birth defects monitoring programs.Finally, grants will be available to State departments of health, universities, or other private, or nonprofit entities to develop and implement birth defect prevention strategies, such as programs using folic acid vitamin supplements to prevent spina bifida and alcohol avoidance strategies to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome.Again, when we talk about birth defects, it is important to note that many birth defects are preventable. For instance, we now know that a simple 400 mg dose of the B vitamin folic acid each day could prevent 50 to 70 percent of all cases of spina bifida and anencephaly--saving about $245 million annually and more importantly, saving some families the heart ache that many of us have witnessed friends and families go through.We must broaden public and professional awareness of birth defects and prevention opportunities, and we must have a coordinated national strategy to achieve this goal.The economic and emotional burden of birth defects on families and society as a whole presents a vivid, human picture of the need for a national research and prevention strategy.Although infant mortality in the United States has been falling steadily over the past few decades, 25 other countries have lower infant mortality rates than the United States.This bill is an important step in improving the health of our Nation. The tragedy of birth defects compels our Nation to become a stronger partner for charitable and medical groups in fulfilling our obligation to protect our Nation's most vulnerable population. Let us hope that more tragedies are not necessary to push Congress into action.This legislation has the support of many national organizations, including: the March of Dimes Foundation, the Spina Bifida Association of America, American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National Easter Seals Society, American Association of Mental Retardation, Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and the American Hospital Association.The bill also has broad bipartisan support.Let me conclude by taking special note of the help of the National and Missouri March of Dimes, as well as numerous health and child advocate organizations, for their assistance in developing and advocating this legislation. Specifically, I wish to thank Dr. Jennifer Howse, Jo Merrill, and Marina Weiss of the March of Dimes for their persistence and commitment to this endeavor.Mr. President, I send a copy of the bill to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:11:25.564012,2015-03-17 19:11:25.564012,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1997-03-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-03-11/html/CREC-1997-03-11-pt1-PgS2129-3.htm,30,2,143,S2129-S2145,B000611,mr. bond
2834,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of final passage and explain why I plan to vote for final passage of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. At the outset, I must make clear that I do not support every provision in this bill. There is much in this bill that is simply extraneous--provisions that do not address the problem of youth violence. Moreover, there are items included in this bill by amendment that I opposed. There are also items that were included through the manager's amendment, such as the creation of new federal judgeships, that I oppose.However, there are many provisions in this bill that I have long championed and have worked hard to include in the bill. Let me briefly summarize these key provisions of this law:There are four main Ashcroft initiatives in the core Senate juvenile justice bill, S. 254. Those provisions are: (1) Trying juveniles as adults on the federal level, (2) targeting adults who use juveniles through increased penalties, (3) funding for improving juvenile record system and incentives for recordsharing, and (4) Charitable choice--preventing discrimination against faith-based organizations that stand ready to provide counseling to troubled youth.First, the core bill makes it easier for federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults in federal court. Specifically, the bill provides local United States Attorneys with new authority to try juveniles 14 and older who commit violent federal crimes and federal drug crimes as adults. This provision is an important improvement in the law. Violent federal crimes and major federal drug crimes are not youthful indiscretions or juvenile pranks--these are serious adult crimes. The bill makes important steps to ensure that in the federal system juveniles who commit adult crimes do adult time.Second, the core bill also targets adults who would exploit children and ensnare them into a life of crime. One sad consequence of a juvenile justice system that treats juvenile crime less seriously than adult crime is that adults try to game the system by using juveniles to perform criminal tasks with the greatest risk of detection. Adults use children as drug runners or couriers precisely because the children are likely to end up back on the street even if they are caught. The core bill addresses this problem by including two provisions from my Protect Children from Violence Act, S. 2023, from the last Congress. Specifically, section 202 increases the mandatory minimums for adults who use juveniles to commit drug crimes from 1 year to 3 years for first-time offenders and from 1 year to 5 years for repeat offenders. Section 203 doubles the penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit crimes of violence and trebles penalties for repeat offenders.The core bill also includes important provisions to facilitate the sharing of juvenile criminal records. This legislation encourages States to keep records on violent juveniles that are the equivalent of the records kept for adults committing comparable crimes. In addition, the bill conditions the availability of federal funds on States' participation in a nationwide system for collecting and sharing juvenile criminal records. Under the bill, state authorities must make these criminal records available to federal and state law enforcement officials and school officials to assist them in providing for the best interests of all students and preventing more tragedies. Providing judges and school officials with accurate records is a critical step in preventing tragedies. School officials and judges have a right and a need to know when they are dealing with dangerous juveniles. Providing accurate records is not only an important role for the government, it is a role that only the federal government can fulfill. Violent juveniles routinely cross state lines. The federal government has an important role in ensuring that their criminal records cross state lines with them.Finally, the core bill includes my provision ensuring that faith-based organizations have an equal opportunity to provide services to at-risk youth. The experience of the past decade has made clear that government does not have all the answers for what ails our culture. No organizations should be excluded from the process of trying to heal our violent culture, let alone faith-based organizations. The ``charitable choice'' provisions in the bill do not provide for any special treatment for faith-based organizations, but they do ensure that faith-based groups will not be arbitrarily excluded when the government turns to non-governmental organizations to deal with at-risk juveniles.The bill in its current form also includes a number of important provisions that were added by amendment. These include:Semi-automatic assault rifles ban for juveniles. The Senate overwhelmingly adopted this Ashcroft amendment. The amendment had three major provisions:(1) Ban on juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault rifles. This provision extends the current limitations (subject to the current exceptions) on youth possession of handguns to semi-automatic assault weapons. The provision does not affect a juvenile's right to possess hunting rifles.(2) Requirement that juveniles be tried as adults for weapons violations in a school zone. Juveniles who commit firearms violations near a school zone must be sent a clear message--such actions will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.(3) Increased penalties for unlawfully transferring a firearm to a juvenile with knowledge that it will be used in a crime of violence.The Senate overwhelmingly approved this comprehensive amendment which reflects not only specific Ashcroft initiatives but the work product of the Republican Education Task Force, which Senator Ashcroft chaired. The major Ashcroft initiatives in the package include:(1) Flexibility for local schools to address school violence. This provision provides schools with the flexibility to use existing education funds, and the new education funds included in the Republican budget, to address security concerns as they see fit. Permissible uses include everything from the installation of metal detectors, to the formulation of inter-agency task forces, to the introduction of school uniform policies.(2) School uniforms. Another Ashcroft provision makes clear that nothing in federal law prevents local school districts from instituting school uniform policies.(3) School records. Another provision makes clear that student disciplinary records should follow students to a new school, without regard to whether it is public or private. Teachers and administrators need to know who they are dealing with and whether they have security risks in their midst.This amendment removes a loophole in federal law that prevents States from disciplining an IDEA student in the same manner as a non-IDEA student, if an IDEA student brings a gun to school. The Senate passed this common sense amendment 74-25. A number of my colleagues also added my initiatives to the bill through their own amendments. These include:This amendment included a number of Ashcroft mandatory minimums. Specifically, Ashcroft provisions in the bill raised mandatory minimums:(1) From 1 to 3 years for distributing drugs near a school zone (from 1 to 5 years for subsequent offenses). This provision was adopted from Ashcroft's Protect Children from Violence Act, S. 2023.(2) From 1 to 3 years for distributing drugs to a juvenile (1 to 5 years for subsequent offenses). This provision was adopted from Ashcroft's Protect Children from Violence Act, S. 2023.(3) From 7 to 10 years for brandishing a firearm during the commission of a federal crime. This provision was adopted from Ashcroft's Juvenile Misuse of Firearms Prevention Act, S. 994.(4) From 10 to 12 years for discharging a firearm during the commission of a federal crime. This provision was adopted from Ashcroft's Juvenile Misuse of Firearms Prevention Act, S. 994.The amendment also included two new Ashcroft mandatory minimum sentences also adopted from S. 994:(1) A 15-year mandatory minimum for maiming or injuring someone with a firearm during the commission of a federal crime(2) A 5-year mandatory minimum for transferring a firearm with knowledge that it will be used in a crime of violence.The Senate also overwhelmingly passed the Hatch-Feinstein amendment designed to target and punish gang violence. The amendment included many provisions long-championed by Ashcroft, including almost the entirety of the gang subtitle of Ashcroft's ``Protect Children from Violence Act,'' S. 538, introduced on March 4, 1999.Specifically, the amendment included the following Ashcroft provisions: enhanced sentences for crimes committed as part of gang violence, new crimes for interstate gang activities, the treatment of juvenile crimes as adult crimes for purposes of the federal laws imposing severe penalties on armed career criminals, and increased penalties for witness tampering. All of these provisions were included in the ``Combating Gang Violence'' subtitle of Ashcroft's Juvenile Crime bill. In summary, this is not a perfect bill. There is much that is extraneous and some that is misguided. I am hopeful some of these provisions will be removed in conference. On balance, however, this bill will help make our schools places of learning, not places of fear.,2015-03-17 19:11:25.945282,2015-03-17 19:11:25.945282,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-20/html/CREC-1999-05-20-pt1-PgS5683.htm,74,241,145,S5683-S5732,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2835,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, today I have the great pleasure of recognizing the remarkable achievements of Reverend Doctor Nelson ``Fuzzy'' Thompson. Rev. Thompson is a minister, community activist, humanitarian, and resident of the Fifth District of Missouri, which I proudly represent.Rev. Thompson graduated from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, with a Bachelor of Science in Education, and received a Master of Divinity and Doctorate of Ministry at St. Paul School of Theology.``Fuzzy,'' as he is affectionately known, has represented the Fifth District of Missouri in an exemplary manner locally and nationally. In service to our community, Fuzzy was an original Board Member of Black Adoption Program and a member of the Executive Committee of the Kansas Children's Service League, showing a commitment to our community's youth. During my term as Mayor, he also served as member and chair of the Human Rights Commission. ``Fuzzy'' now serves as President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Kansas City.Politically, Rev. Thompson served as a Regional Coordinator for Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential Campaign in 1984 and Missouri State Coordinator for Rev. Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign. Furthermore, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from 1984-2000.Reverend Thompson has also represented our nation on an international platform. At the request of Bishop Desmond Tutu, President Nelson Mandela, and the South African Council of Churches, he was one of 22 U.S. ministers that traveled to South Africa on a fact-finding educational exchange. Reverend Thompson traveled to South Africa a second time as an official observer for the first election held in South Africa granting the right to vote to all races. He called the experience humbling, as he watched people line up for blocks in order to exercise their right to vote for the first time. He was also one of three U.S. ministers to conduct Easter services for hostages being held in Tehran, Iran.As well as a strong advocate for human rights around the globe, he is just as strong an advocate for civil rights and economic rights within our community. When South Africa was a nation which practiced apartheid, Dr. Thompson helped organize a protest against a Frank Sinatra concert. The purpose was to draw attention to American celebrities who performed in racially exclusive venues. He has organized pickets in opposition to monies from the local school district awarded to contractors who had failed to include minority contractors.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Reverend Dr. Nelson ``Fuzzy'' Thompson for serving the State of Missouri and our nation. He is a true role model to the citizens of our country and his successes serve as a stepping stone for many others eager to serve. I offer this small token of appreciation to an exceptional civil servant for all of the work he has done, taking strength from the many lives he has touched throughout our community.,2015-03-17 19:11:26.274521,2015-03-17 19:11:26.274521,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF REV.

2836,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day.Over 15 years has passed since Hillary Clinton famously declared in Beijing that women's rights are human rights. Since then, we have seen considerable gains in momentum surrounding the importance of women's empowerment, not only as a matter of equality--but importantly--as good development and national security policy. Nevertheless, despite the growing call for women's rights and elevation of their roles in decision-making processes, there is still much more progress to be made.Today, women and girls are disproportionately impacted by extreme poverty, making up 70% of the world's 1 billion people who live off less than $1 per day. While women account for over half of the population, they occupy slightly less than 19% of seats in national parliaments on average worldwide. They are vastly more vulnerable in the face of crisis; four of every five people displaced by war or natural disaster are women and children. Women continue to face broad challenges such as access to health care, education and economic opportunities, lack of legal rights and judicial process, and targets of trafficking and sexual and gender-based violence.While the world's women face daunting obstacles, they are also the most promising and untapped agents of change. What has become increasingly clear is everyone benefits when women and girls have access to equal educational, political, and economic opportunities. When women are free to earn a living--as farmers, entrepreneurs, business owners, etc.--they make their families and communities stronger and more secure. When women and girls have access to educational opportunities, their empowerment allows families and entire communities to flourish and prosper. And evidence shows that when women are empowered to engage in the political process, governments are more effective and responsive to their people.The world simply cannot achieve lasting peace and prosperity if half of the population is not empowered. For real advancement in women's rights, we must take a comprehensive approach that combats all barriers--physical, economic, socio-cultural, psychological and otherwise--to women's equality.On this 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day, let us celebrate the strides we have made in advancing women's rights, and therefore, human rights and human progress. Let us also reaffirm our commitment to continue these gains until women and men, girls and boys, have equal opportunities to realize their hopes and dreams on every corner of the globe.I have also included a statement on behalf of Peace X Peace, a nonprofit organization dedicated to lifting women's voices, strengthening women's capacity to connect across divides, promoting leadership and gender equity, and nurturing the global network of peacebuilders.On this 100th anniversary of International Women's Day, Peace X Peace () stands proudly for peace and justice in solidarity with women around the world, especially those who are engaged in the struggle for human rights. We stand with all those who uphold the right of women and men to self-expression, self-determination, and a decent standard of living for themselves and their families. We stand for the efforts of all women to have an equal voice and representation in their communities and nations. We stand for connection, not division: for building bridges of understanding across every divide.www.peacexpeace.orgWe celebrate the power of mothers, sisters, and daughters to nurture the feminine in themselves and others, to remind us that we win when we win together and we all lose when we practice violence, revenge, demeaning the 'other' and spreading fear of those who are different from ourselves.

2837,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the 125th Anniversary of Tension Envelope Corporation, a prestigious family-owned business in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, which I am honored to represent. In 1886, the forerunner of Tension Envelope opened in Kansas City, Missouri, as Berkowitz and Company. Named after its founder, William Berkowitz, the company specialized in popular advertising novelties and business stationery. In 1894, the company put into operation the first envelope machine west of the Mississippi River.By 1901, the company began to fully concentrate on envelopes, which were in great demand by businesses and organizations. William Berkowitz's two sons joined the firm in 1907, and the company's first envelope patent was issued in 1909. Sons Walter and E.B. Berkowitz assumed management of the company as the 1920s approached. Walter soon discovered new high-speed envelope folding machinery that had been developed in Germany. The company purchased the North American patent and distribution rights and brought the equipment into the United States, revolutionizing the American envelope industry.In 1937, the company acquired another pioneer in the U.S. envelope industry, the Tension Envelope Company of Brooklyn, New York. In 1944, all of the Berkowitz Envelope manufacturing and sales operations were consolidated under the widely recognized name of Tension Envelope Corporation. In 1962, Bert Berkley, grandson of the company's founder, became President and CEO of Tension. In 1988, Bill Berkley, great grandson of the founder, became President and CEO.Today, Tension Envelope Corporation is one of the nation's leading manufacturers of envelope products, selling directly to companies and organizations across the United States. Tension manufactures many of the envelopes you see and handle every day. With its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, the heart of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, Tension produces over eleven billion envelopes a year with plants, distribution, and service offices stretching from coast to coast.Not only have Tension's leaders revolutionized an industry with their ingenuity, they are also dedicated philanthropists. Bert Berkley, Chairman of Tension, has a long history of participation in local, regional, and national civic and advisory councils. He even co-authored a book, Giving Back, on the subject of volunteering, sharing with the community, and involvement with charitable endeavors. My good friend, Richard Berkley, served as Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, for three terms prior to my election to that post in 1991.

2838,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, on Monday, March 8, 2010, the world will mark the 15th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action--the most comprehensive global policy framework to achieve the goals of gender equality, development and peace.While we reflect on this milestone and celebrate the advancements of women thus far, we also need to pause and take stock of what more can be achieved. To fully live up to the goals of equality, development and peace it is imperative that we continue to promote opportunities for women to directly shape these policies by being involved in politics at all levels, and in all countries. Without this perspective, equality is no more than a hollow word.The 1997 Universal Declaration on Democracy states that true democracy cannot be achieved unless there is a genuine, equal and complementary partnership between men and women in the conduct of the affairs of society. Even we in the United States, where there are only about 15 percent of women in legislative positions and only 33 percent in ministerial positions, have a long way to go to fulfill this principle. It is important that lawmakers, both here and abroad, advocate for policies that empower women. In many countries that I've traveled to, I have seen firsthand the need for support from governments, international bodies, NGO's, and local communities. It is especially important that we educate young women and girls from an early age in order to give them as many opportunities later in life.Just this last Congress the United States joined the list of countries that have shattered the glass ceiling of female leadership in parliament, with the appointment of Nancy Pelosi as the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. We have yet to elect a female President--although we will surely see that day soon.However, the leadership and courage of strong women in the United States who have broken down tough barriers continues to inspire many around the world. These women have demonstrated remarkable accomplishment our nation, and women across the globe can be proud of. They are a testament to the power of women everywhere.Likewise we look to groundbreaking female leaders in other countries and praise their confidence and ability in forging the path for others to dare to fill their shoes and even go beyond. One of the best examples of this, is Liberian President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. She inspired many when she addressed a Joint Session of Congress.The challenges faced by peoples everywhere are faced with the help of strong women. And today many women still face challenges fully acceding to all of the positions and roles formerly reserved for men. The impact and involvement of women is critical in reducing poverty, improving education and health care, reducing the violence against them, enhancing human rights on the whole, and even recovering from the brunt of the global economic crisis.We celebrate these advancements, but continue to pursue and address the various challenges and inequalities women face day to day. I would like to thank the Inter-Parliamentary Union for its great work on this front and for calling this gathering today, in the spirit of cooperation and progress toward achieving the goals of equality, peace and development.,2015-03-17 19:11:27.007041,2015-03-17 19:11:27.007041,Extensions,COMMEMORATING THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEIJING DECLARATION AND PLATFORM FOR ACTION AND INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY,2010-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-03-04/html/CREC-2010-03-04-pt1-PgE302-2.htm,30,0,156,E302,C001060,mr. carnahan
2839,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Paul Oostburg Sanz, who until recently served as the General Counsel of the House Armed Services Committee. As a result of his confirmation by the other body late last week, Paul will soon take a new position as the General Counsel of the Department of the Navy.Paul Oostburg Sanz became General Counsel of the House Armed Services Committee in January 2007, just at the time I had the honor to begin serving as committee chairman. In the almost three years since, Paul has played a critical role in day-to-day operations of the committee and has also been a trusted advisor on the legal issues facing the Department of Defense.It is no exaggeration to say that Paul's ability to grasp complex issues, his attention to detail, and his years of experience on Capitol Hill were instrumental in helping our committee and the Congress to achieve the enactment of the last three annual National Defense Authorization Acts.Our committee and the Congress have particularly benefited from Paul's expertise on matters related to detainee policy and the Military Commissions Act, as well as issues related to counter-narcotics, matters related to Southern Command, and international legal issues.A look at Paul's resume gives you a good idea about the breadth and diversity of his experience. He earned a law degree at Harvard University Law School and earned a Master in Public Affairs degree from Princeton University.His international experience includes service as Peace Corps English teacher in Guinea-Bissau, and work in South Africa conducting political party training during the historic 1994 national elections. Paul also worked on conflict-resolution issues for the U.S. Embassy in Liberia, and on democracy and governance programs for the USAID Mission in Mozambique.Before coming to Capitol Hill, Paul clerked for a U.S. district court judge in Puerto Rico. From May 2001 to December 2006, Paul served as the Deputy Chief Counsel for the House Committee on International Relations, providing strategic and procedural counsel to our distinguished colleague, the late Congressman Tom Lantos, who at that time was the committee's Ranking Member.It is clear that Paul has the education, experience, and intellectual gifts to be an excellent General Counsel for the U.S. Navy. I also believe Paul has the temperament to serve our country exceptionally well in this position. In the time I have worked with Paul, he has approached every problem and every challenge thrown his way with a calm demeanor and rational analysis. Then he gets to work, and his hard work pays off.Because of Paul Oostburg Sanz's outstanding ability and work performance, I am not surprised the Obama Administration sought him out to serve at the Pentagon. The prospect of Paul's departure from the Hill gives me no joy, but I am happy that his talents have been recognized and that our country will continue to benefit from his service. Paul will be missed by all of us on the House Armed Services Committee, but I wish him every success in his new role as General Counsel of the Department of the Navy.,2015-03-17 19:11:27.318262,2015-03-17 19:11:27.318262,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO PAUL OOSTBURG SANZ,2010-03-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-03-10/html/CREC-2010-03-10-pt1-PgE348.htm,34,0,156,E348,S000465,mr. skelton
2840,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I wish to extend my thanks to Dr. Robert Tabash for dedicating his career to the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem, Palestine. Thanks to his concern for the people of Palestine, Dr. Tabash has created a hospital that is truly an oasis of peace in the troubled region and is a shining example of humanitarian assistance.Dr. Tabash's work to build an oasis of peace to serve mothers and babies in conflict-torn Palestine has not been an easy road. After serving as a staff physician beginning in 1971, Dr. Tabash was appointed the Director of Administration to the Holy Family Hospital in 1985. That same year the hospital was forced to close due to the Arab-Israeli conflict. After a 5-year renovation period, Dr. Tabash's vision finally came to life when the hospital was inaugurated. That same year, Dr. Tabash saw the first baby born in the new facility. Since, the hospital has successfully delivered over 50,000 newborns. With the only neonatal intensive care unit in the area, Holy Family Hospital has amazingly limited the mortality rate to around 2 percent, on par with Western hospitals and remarkably different than the roughly 30 percent mortality rate found in government-run hospitals in the West Bank.This impressive success rate with high risk pregnancies and track record for saving premature babies makes the Hospital special. But what makes Holy Family truly shine is their commitment to serving pregnant women and babies in the West Bank, regardless of religion or race. Despite this commitment, more than 90 percent of Holy Family's patients are Muslim. Backed by U.S. dollars--and I am proud to have secured $3.5 million for the hospital in 2005--Holy Family not only gives the unborn a chance at life in a troubled part of the world, it also works to dispel the false notions that America is at war with the Muslim world and sides only with the Israeli people.Holy Family Hospital is one of the most successful and touching examples of Smart Power in the Middle East--where through non-military engagement, like diplomacy, education, and in this case, humanitarian assistance, we can win hearts and minds, a necessary first step to peace.Dr. Tabash is a Christian Palestinian doctor. Born in Bethlehem himself, it is Dr. Tabash, and his endless devotion to serving the most vulnerable in Bethlehem--pregnant mothers and babies--that has made the hospital the success story it is today. Dr. Tabash is the rare individual who recognizes that the work of one person--every person--can make a difference. Through his work, Dr. Tabash has saved thousands of babies' lives and touched countless more.On the occasion of Dr. Tabash's retirement I offer gratitude and congratulations for the good Doctor's contributions--to the lives of many mothers and babies and to the long-hoped dream of peace in the Middle East. ,2015-03-17 19:11:27.562436,2015-03-17 19:11:27.562436,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2010-06-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-17/html/CREC-2010-06-17-pt1-PgS5107.htm,91,0,156,S5107,B000611,mr. bond
2841,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I wish to thank Rose Penn Ross for her dedicated service to our Nation during World War II. Mrs. Ross, or Penny as she is called, is a retired school teacher who selflessly answered the patriotic call to duty when she enlisted in the Women Airforce Service Pilots--WASP--organization during World War II.Like many of her counterparts in the ``Greatest Generation,'' Penny wanted to help the war effort. As a licensed pilot, Penny wanted to serve by flying planes, and joined 25,000 women in applying for the WASP program. After completing exactly the same rigorous military flight training as her male counterparts, Penny became one of only 1,100 women to receive her Silver Wings.While the WASP organization was not recognized as part of the military until 1977, Penny and the other women serving in WASP played a critical role in the war effort. Within the United States, Penny brought planes from factories to bases, flew experimental aircraft, and towed targets for the gunnery school vital tasks that also freed up male pilots for combat service and duties.Prior to the war, Penny graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a bachelor's degree in business and earned her master's in education from the University of Missouri. She married her beloved Vernon M. Ross and settled in Missouri. Vernon and Penny started a family, which grew to include four children: Robert, Barbara, David, and Richard; eight grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. After WASP was disbanded in 1944, Penny began her teaching career. She taught secondary school for 30 years in Harrisburg, Glasgow, and Moberly, molding young minds in the subjects of business, math, and French.In addition to her legacy of family and her love of learning, Penny has created a legacy of service to our Nation.Penny, her fellow female pilots, and the countless other men and women who served their nation during World War II made possible the conquering of some of freedom's worst foes of the 20th century: Hitler, Mussolini, and Hirohito. Thanks to the struggles and sacrifices of all of our troops from here at home, to Normandy, Tunisia, Midway, and Guadalcanal, those of us in subsequent generations have lived in relative peace and prosperity.It is only fitting that earlier this year Americans like Penny were recognized for their contributions to the freedom we enjoy today. On March 10, 2010, Mrs. Ross attended the WASP Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in the U.S. Capitol. With her family by her side, she was presented with a bronze medal replica of the Gold Medal. Today, Penny resides in the Veterans Home-Mexico, MO.Penny, we are grateful for your service to your family, your community, and your country. Your story is an inspiration to people in all generations today who want to make a difference. ,2015-03-17 19:11:27.818613,2015-03-17 19:11:27.818613,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2010-07-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-07-27/html/CREC-2010-07-27-pt1-PgS6296-3.htm,111,0,156,S6296-S6297,B000611,mr. bond
2842,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of Mr. Clyde McQueen, an individual who has dedicated his life to economic development and job training initiatives in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, the district that I am honored to represent. This week, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, Mr. McQueen will be inducted into the Missouri Walk of Fame, an annual occasion held to honor the achievements of African Americans who have made significant contributions to Missouri.Mr. McQueen serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Full Employment Council--Missouri Career Center, a center that works to promote job training and placement in the Kansas City, Missouri and the surrounding areas. The Full Employment Council is a nonprofit organization tasked with providing career employment and training for the unemployed and the underemployed. In this position, Mr. McQueen, administers and directs funding towards job training, education, and economic development. The Full Employment Council is responsible for program activities that work to develop employment training programs in rural, urban, and suburban areas.Mr. McQueen has served in this role for over 23 years, and has assisted over a half a million people during his tenure. While in this position, Mr. McQueen's commitment to unemployment has been recognized by a proclamation from the Missouri House and Senate, as well as from a letter of appreciation from former President Bill Clinton in recognition of support offered to the President during his 1996 visit to Kansas City. Prior to serving as President and CEO of the Full Employment Council, Mr. McQueen served as Division Director of Training and Employment Development for the Texas Department of Community Affairs. In this role, Mr. McQueen was responsible for directing the budget to fund units of government, business organizations, and community based groups for job training and employment initiatives.Mr. McQueen received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Speech Communication and Political Science from the Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. Currently, he is a board member of the U.S. Conference of Mayor's Workforce Development Council, and was appointed to the Missouri Automobile Task Force by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon. Mr. McQueen has been awarded the ``Professional of the Year'' award by the Missouri Association of Workforce Development and a ``Local Hero'' award by Ingram's Magazine.Madam Speaker, it is an honor and privilege for me to recognize Mr. Clyde McQueen for his efforts to improve the workforce and advance job training in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. I know that Mr. McQueen will continue to fight for both the unemployed and underemployed in my district, and in this time when unemployed rates have plummeted, I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of Mr. McQueen.

2843,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,I thank Mr. Ehlers for yielding.I certainly was pleased to join my colleague from Maryland, the majority leader, as an original sponsor of this Best Buddies Empowerment for People with Intellectual Disabilities Act.This isn't the first time that Mr. Hoyer and I have joined with our colleagues to come together in a meaningful way in this important area. In fact, we are both proud of the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act in 2004 that became law during the 108th Congress.The success stories of healthy athletes, the program that emerged out of that effort, is really the great result of what we did. The reports we get from Special Olympics have been heartening every year as those athletes come together.It's estimated that between 7 and 8 million Americans live with intellectual disabilities, impacting nearly one in every 10 families. For these individuals, life is not always welcoming. Very rarely is it easy. People with intellectual disabilities are often excluded from society, whether that's a school, in the workplace or in their communities, simply because they are different.So I have been glad to support a program that we have talked about today, Best Buddies. It's been mentioned that it was organized 20 years ago by Anthony Shriver, and it really was designed to help integrate people with intellectual disabilities into the mainstream of society to end their isolation, to help them embark on productive, fulfilling lives by finding a buddy that didn't have the disabilities that they have.The Best Buddies program works with volunteers to establish meaningful friendships with their nondisabled peers in order to help increase the self-esteem and confidence of people with and without intellectual disabilities. This is a program that's enhanced the lives of individuals by providing real and safe opportunities for one-on-one friendships and new options for employment.These can often be life-changing events for individuals and often are life-changing events for those individuals with intellectual disabilities. This is often the first time in their lives that they have had someone to call their friend, someone to be their friend who didn't have disabilities, and introduced them to the world without disabilities.This bill helps accomplish that goal in a number of significant ways. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants or contracts with Best Buddies to conduct and expand its activities.It has an eye on increasing the participation of individuals with intellectual disabilities, as well as to promote outreach programs. This bill will go a long way toward dispelling negative hurtful stereotypes and make clear the extraordinary gifts that people with intellectual disabilities nonetheless possess and, with just a little encouragement, are able to utilize.More important, it will help move people from intellectual disabilities from the margins of society to the mainstream of society.I know Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Ehlers, Mr. Tonko and I hope to see this bill enacted into law, knowing that it will help raise the hope and dignity of people with intellectual disabilities and further empower their full participation in our communities.I hope my colleagues pass this bill today. We intend to work for its enactment into law and look forward to the difference that this bill, Mr. Speaker, can make in the lives of people.,2015-03-17 19:11:28.418044,2015-03-17 19:11:28.418044,House,BEST BUDDIES EMPOWERMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ACT OF 2009,2009-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-04-22/html/CREC-2009-04-22-pt1-PgH4615.htm,59,11,155,H4615-H4618,B000575,mr. blunt
2844,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the First Baptist Church in Bolivar, Missouri, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary of serving its community guided by the teachings of Jesus Christ. Starting with a charter group of seven believers in early September, 1859, today the First Baptist Church in Bolivar includes more than 1,500 members.Its 150 year history has been marked by steady growth and renewed commitments of service to the community and members of its congregation. Today, First Baptist in Bolivar provides more than spiritual richness; it offers recreation, child care, educational and family support through an array of missions, programs and services all geared to serve God.It started as a small charter group organized as the ``United Baptist Church of Jesus Christ at Bolivar'' and at its second meeting voted to build a house of worship--the first of what would be five structures. With unrest in the nation caused by events that would lead to civil war, the church treasury was empty in January, 1861. Three months later with the start of the Civil War, construction of the new church for its 17 worshipers was halted. The building was left unfinished and in debt.The conclusion of the war left only four members of the original congregation living in Bolivar. It was 1866 when D.R. Murphy stepped into the leadership role at the struggling church. As pastor, Murphy took up the call to resume construction of the church building and mount a donated church bell in the new tower.Two years later the church was still under construction, but the congregation decided to move their worship services from the courthouse to the new church in August, even before the walls were plastered. The building was painted with pews and kerosene lamps in place by the end of the year, and the Bolivar church began to grow.The first organized choir could be heard in 1869 accompanied by organ music. And the size of the congregation underwent a dramatic increase when Southwest Baptist College was moved from Lebanon to Bolivar in 1880. A month-long revival in January saw the congregation more than double, including the baptism of 28 people on February 8, 1880.By 1888, the church's name had been changed to the First Baptist Church, and membership continued to increase as the town and nearby college grew in population. In 1897 an entirely new building, complete with baptistery and gravity furnace, was in place. It was wired for electricity in 1901. It was replaced in 1926 with larger quarters on the northern half of Block #32 as Sunday school enrollments and congregational growth demanded expanded educational quarters. Other expansions came in 1959 and in the early 1980s.The character of the First Baptist Church in Bolivar has been shaped over the decades by its location in the bedrock center of the nation and its close relationship with Southwest Baptist University, where I had the privilege of serving as President before my tenure in Congress. Education and leadership have given the church a unique outlook on the world, its community and the good works it does in the Lord's name.First Baptist is making plans for their 150th anniversary celebration events throughout the month of September. The anniversary theme is Celebrate God's Faithfulness--Yesterday, Today, Forever. As my former house of worship, I know the people of this congregation, their work ethic, their love of God and the strength of their faith as they serve their community and the world.,2015-03-17 19:11:28.762288,2015-03-17 19:11:28.762288,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF BOLIVAR, MISSOURI,2009-09-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-09/html/CREC-2009-09-09-pt1-PgE2218-3.htm,126,0,155,E2218,B000575,mr. blunt
2845,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I inform the House of the death of Rear Admiral Wayne E. Meyer. He is known as the ``Father of Aegis'' for his 13 years of work on the Aegis Weapons systems.Adm. Meyer was born in Brunswick, Missouri, on April 21, 1926. In 1943, he enlisted with the Navy. While serving with the Navy, he graduated from the University of Kansas in 1946 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. He also obtained a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and M.S. in Astronautics and Aeronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Additionally, he received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School. His engineering education would later help with his work on developing advanced weapons systems for the Navy.One of Adm. Meyer's first assignments found him manning the radar of the USS Goodrich only after 11 months of radar and sonar training at M.I.T. In the post-World War II period, he served as part of the occupation forces in the Mediterranean, China, and Japan seas. Upon his return to the U.S., he enrolled and taught in variety of schools from 1951-1955. These included studying at the Joint Guided Missile School in Fort Bliss, Texas, and the Naval Line School in Monterey, California. He later was instructor at the Special Weapons School in Norfolk Virginia. Following his studies at Monterey and M.I.T., he was ordered to the USS Galveston, where he served as Gunnery Sergeant and eventually oversaw the conversion to the first Talos missiles on the cruiser.In 1963, he was chosen to serve in the Navy Task Force for Surface Guided Missile Systems. Later, he was also appointed to assist with the analog to high-speed digital system transition on 30 Terrier-armed ships. He became the Director of Engineering at the Naval Ship Missile Systems Engineering Station in 1967. Three years later, he was called to Washington, D.C., to head the Aegis Weapons System. In the following years, he was named supervisor of many projects, including the Surface Missile Systems and Surface Warfare. In January 1975, he was chosen for Rear Admiral. Shortly after his selection, he became the founding Project Manager of Aegis Shipbuilding, and, in 1983, he was reassigned as Deputy Commander, Weapons and Combat Systems, Naval Sea Systems Command. Eventually, he retired from active duty in 1985.In his retirement, Adm. Meyer served in a variety of consulting positions, including assisting the Surface Navy and the Missile Defense Agency's development of missile defense capability for the nation's Aegis fleet and serving on many committees chartered by Department of Defense personnel.Madam Speaker, Admiral Wayne E. Meyer was an honorable officer in the military. I am certain that the members of the House will join me in extending their heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.

2846,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, too many families in Missouri and across the Nation are feeling the pain of the housing crisis. They need our help now. This Senate is coming together on a bipartisan basis to provide some relief to deal with some of the real problems we find in communities throughout our Nation.Over the Easter break, I traveled around the State. I talked with a lot of folks who have a real and deep interest in this housing crisis. I met with families struggling under the threat of foreclosure, neighborhood groups counseling families on how to keep their homes, government officials at the local level--mayors and council members--who were trying to find ways they could assist, community leaders asking for our help. They told me about the neighborhoods devastated by foreclosures. More critically, they told me of the personal problems faced by families running into foreclosure where their adjustable rates had risen so high they could no longer afford them. And they talked to me about the devastation of family after family being threatened with losing their home.I did not hear from speculators who overbuilt and are now caught with too much inventory. I did not hear from investors who bought a second or third vacation home, expecting that the price would go up more than they paid for it and now regret their bad decisions. And I did not hear from the greedy lenders who went out and offered terms that were too good to be true. Some of the worst ones were the no-downpayment loans. Many others offered unbelievable teaser rates and then put out paper that was absolutely unaffordable by the borrowers. They spread this toxic paper throughout the system. It is putting at risk not only our national financial system, but that toxic stuff has spread to international markets, and markets across the world are feeling the pain of our subprime crisis.In Missouri, I heard from mothers and fathers who want to keep their home. I heard from fixed-income seniors who thought they had a deal they could live with until the rates started adjusting and the mortgages got out of their ability to pay. These folks do not want a government handout. They do not want a bailout. They do not want the Federal Government buying their mortgage or buying the homes around them. They are hard-working Americans who want to be able to meet their original commitments and keep the promises they made. They need targeted temporary help to get them refinanced and on with the rest of their lives.That is the kind of relief I offered on behalf of several of my Republican colleagues in the Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act, or SAFE Act, of 2008. It provided help for families to refinance distressed subprime mortgages, help for neighborhoods for the purchase of foreclosed homes, help for returning war vets coming home to the threat of foreclosure, and reform of the Federal Housing Administration that we all agreed upon last year and still have not been able to pass.These proposals, I am very happy to say, form the core of the Foreclosure Prevention Act substitute amendment that is before us today. I thank Senators Dodd and Shelby who came together and assembled this bipartisan package of relief for families and neighborhoods. They took proposals from our SAFE Act, housing proposals from our Democratic colleagues, and provisions from our friends on the Finance Committee to make this relief package.Most importantly, this measure will help struggling families refinance their subprime mortgages by authorizing State housing finance agencies to issue $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds and use the proceeds for refinancing.I happen to know very well how effectively our Missouri Housing Development Corporation functions, and if they have this authority and if they can sell their bonds, then they will be able to refinance where people have seen their mortgage payments escalate beyond their ability to pay. This is the kind of assistance we expect from our housing finance agencies, and we need to empower them.Secondly, to help families know their options to avoid foreclosure and keep them in their homes, it provides an additional $100 million for loan counseling. I was proud to be able to join with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, in the Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill last year to put $180 million in counseling. Congress passed it in December. The first of these funds has gone out, and they tell me already they are having a great effect. Many say that knowledge means power. Housing counselors I met with over the recess told me how these counseling funds are helping families know how to renegotiate with their banks to get good refinancing and keep their homes.The message all of us ought to carry back to our home States when we talk to people who are threatened by these problems is that if you see your mortgage rates going up beyond your ability to pay, if you have concerns about whether you can meet the terms of the financing, don't wait until foreclosure proceedings are initiated. Don't wait until you get hauled up on the courthouse steps to see your property sold. There are counseling agencies that we have funded and will be funded additionally across the country in every large community that will come in and work with the homeowner and with the lending agencies to try to work out terms.Many of these will be able to get refinanced. It has to be voluntary on both sides, but as has been said earlier on this floor, lenders have a real disincentive for foreclosing. They got into the business not to own homes, they got in the business to receive payments. Very often this means there is common ground which can be agreeable to the homeowners and the lenders to stay the costs and the risks of foreclosure.Foreclosure not only is devastating to the family, it is very devastating to the neighborhood. The neighbors see their home values go down, and the whole community suffers. That is why I had mayors and council members and city aldermen coming out and saying, what can we do? I said: Get good education.As the Senator from California said, we need better education for people before they seek to buy a home, and certainly we need education and counseling for those who see mortgage payments rising above their reach.Back to the provisions in this bill. We supported on our side--and this measure includes--help for struggling neighborhoods by providing tax credits for that purpose over the next year of a home in or facing foreclosure. It is $7,000 available for families moving in and living in the home over 2 years to keep the neighborhoods from being flooded with properties in foreclosure, which drags down property values for everyone. These tax credits should help all homeowners in the neighborhood by stabilizing property values as families get back into vacant homes and add value.Not surprisingly--not surprisingly--when I laid out this proposal to the roundtables and the discussion groups I had around the State, one of the things the mayors and the city councilmen liked the most was this ability to get those homes in foreclosure sold and occupied by borrowers who would be contributing members of the community and helping to stabilize those communities. They recognize the importance this has for their communities as well as the families who would be living there.One other part of this proposal that is very important to me is that the measure proposes new loan disclosure requirements with a prominent, plain English explanation of key loan conditions. I want the borrowers to see in big type any teaser rates or introductory rates, anything that will change the terms of their payments or limit their ability and lead to foreclosure.I have had the distinction of living in several houses in the last few years. As we have moved from house to house and purchased homes, I have seen that stack of documents. As the occupant of the chair, I used to be a lawyer. I am recovering from it now. I have looked at those documents and tried to make sense of them, and I tell you there is not enough time if you are purchasing a house. It took me about 45 minutes to sign all the pieces of paper that came before me. Now, that doesn't help anybody. The Truth in Lending Act has gone to ridiculous extremes. Unfortunately, we let lawyers draft that, and there ought to be a law against lawyers drafting any kind of disclosure documents. We need to have those simple, in plain English, so you know what your rate is, what it could rise to, whether there is a prepayment penalty, and whether you can refinance it. That is on the first or second page.Tell me something I need to know. Don't make me sign 30 pages saying I have read all the fine type or all the fine print.Everybody knows that is a joke. Let us put disclosure in plain terms. That should be a help in the future.We also have a provision from Senator Coleman of Minnesota in this bill to give returning war veterans more time to avoid home foreclosure. Currently, they have a 3-month window from their return to work out any mortgage difficulties they have. This may not be enough time for them. So this proposed measure would extend the protection against foreclosure to 6 months after arrival home. That is the least we can do for our returning heroes.We have included provisions of the Federal Housing Act reform bill, which passed the Senate 93 to 1 last year. That bipartisan, near unanimous reform bill deserves to become law. FHA is one of our key financing insuring agencies for lower income people. We need to make sure it works. We have heard about the possible application of FHA Secure to assist borrowers whose mortgage payments have gone beyond their reach, but it is too limited. They can't use it. We need to loosen up the terms so that the terms are not so strict that FHA is in the position of what some people used to characterize as a bank being a place that lends you an umbrella and takes it back when it starts to rain. The FHA holds out great promise for being able to insure loans and get people in houses, but when they say, if you do anything, if there is anything, if you miss any step, you can't get the protection, it seems to me maybe we have tightened it down too hard.I believe, however, for the future, it ought to be the policy of the FHA--and I would hope it would be the policy of any responsible mortgage broker or lender--not to make any no-downpayment loans. No-downpayment loans are one of the most significant contributors to housing foreclosures and failure to be able to meet those terms. If you don't have the money to buy a house, there is nothing wrong with living in a rented house. I have lived in rented houses. You can save up the money to buy a house. But to buy a house responsibly, you need to have some downpayment. I hope that the FHA would get rid of the idea that it is the American dream to put somebody into a house with no equity in it. That is asking for trouble, and that is one of the sources of the trouble we face.I would say one other thing. A lot of people are now realizing that this housing crisis is the basis of financial challenges and financial difficulties in the United States and possibly even internationally. I said earlier, this toxic paper has been spread throughout the world, and there are banks in other countries, there are investment houses in other countries that are suffering because of it. There had to be steps taken at the Federal level, and some of the steps were a little bit breathtaking. I was not wild about seeing the Fed have to move in and wipe out Bear Stearns and provide the guarantees, but I am willing to accept what the Chairman said, and what others have said, that this was necessary to stop the domino effect of collapsing Federal institutions and federally insured institutions, and it is necessary to stop a worldwide panic from subprime loans.There are other steps that have been taken as well--lowering the Fed rate to 3\1/4\, 2\1/4\. These steps are necessary on a macro level. But let me tell you one thing. This macro problem has a micro problem basis. The problem we face is not just what happens in Washington or happens in New York or happens at the Federal Reserve. This problem depends upon how we solve the problems of the families facing foreclosure, of the communities seeing a wave of foreclosures driving down property values.This problem requires also that we work for a solution that begins at the ground up; that takes care of the families in need; that takes care of the communities facing these problems and not do only what has been done nationally, what we read about in the headlines, but what we can only see in community newspapers back home, as to how we help families and communities struggling with foreclosure.This housing bill before us represents the needs and values of our families and neighborhoods. It doesn't provide for any government buyouts of mortgages, as some propose. It does not provide for refinancing of vacation or investment homes, as some fear. Together, our housing proposal will help families and neighborhoods across this country get through the crisis and help our financial systems to maintain stability. But most of all, for our families, for our neighborhoods, for our communities, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.Madam President, I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:29.529835,2015-03-17 19:11:29.529835,Senate,NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND THE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007,2008-04-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-04-03/html/CREC-2008-04-03-pt1-PgS2368-4.htm,52,85,154,S2368-S2401,B000611,mr. bond
2847,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his kind words about the housing bill that is before us. This is the measure on which we are working on a bipartisan basis to deal with what is one of the most serious economic problems we face today in America and across the world. There has been so much subprime mortgage paper put out from adjustable rate mortgages and teaser mortgages in the United States that it has gone into financial systems in many countries, and they are facing similar problems to the ones our financial system faces here.I believe there are a lot of steps that are important that we take at the macro levels, things the Federal Reserve does and what the Treasury can do and what the government-regulated, government-sponsored entities can do. But it is also my firm belief that this problem is one that we are going to have to save community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and family by family. That is why I have an amendment filed today, Bond amendment No. 3436, to avoid these problems in the future.I have listened to a lot of homeowners, and one of the real problems we have is right now there is not a clear and simple disclosure of payments and interest rates for adjustable rate loans with the so-called teaser rates. The teaser loans with interest rates and payments that jump up to unaffordable levels played a large part in the current subprime mortgage crisis. Many potential borrowers either did not understand what they were getting into or were falsely assured that everything would be OK. That is a part of bringing relief to families and neighborhoods suffering through the current housing finance crisis. I want to ensure we do not face another crisis in the future because we did not correct the problem.For those of us who have taken out a mortgage loan to buy or refinance a home, we know what a pile of paperwork we face and all the legal jargon. I am a recovering attorney. I have had the experience of having that stack of papers--enough to choke a horse--put down in front of me, and the real estate agent, whoever is there, just says: Sign this, sign this, sign this, sign this, sign this. About 40 minutes later, you are dizzy from signing, and nothing in those papers clearly tells you what you are getting into. That is why we passed the original Truth in Lending Act and applied it to home mortgage loans. We knew then that most people did not take the time to read and understand the fine print in mortgage loan documents.Regrettably, the consumer protections in the original Truth in Lending Act were written long ago and are outdated--woefully outdated. They were written when most bought a home with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Now--and this is a good thing--there are many more loan tools to help people share in the dream of home ownership. There are adjustable rate mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages with initial fixed terms, sometimes called teasers, prepayment penalties, refinance options, quicker and easier than ever before. But while more choices can be a good thing, uneducated consumers or consumers who do not have assistance in understanding that information may not understand that what they are doing is falling into a trap.I want to see the disclosures laid out simply so that nobody is caught in a trap the way one of my constituents, Willie Clay of Kansas City, MO, and his family were caught. I shared Willie's story on the floor a month ago when we first introduced the SAFE Act, Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act, a relief bill, which forms the basis of the Dodd-Shelby bill before us.Willie lives in a working-class Kansas City neighborhood of modest ranch homes called Ruskin Heights. He was a Vietnam war paratrooper, living largely on disability payments. He refinanced a mortgage in 2004 for a total of $101,000. As we can see, Willie is a man of modest means. He was not a speculator gambling on the housing market; he was not an investor buying a vacation home; he just wanted to live in a decent home. He was looking for extra money to pay off his medical bills, car loans, and some credit cards, and he agreed to a subprime adjustable rate loan with an initial fixed rate of 8.2 percent. For several years, everything went fine. He made the payments, honored his agreement. Then, last October, the initial fixed rate ended and the loan reset to a variable rate. Given the condition of the market at the time, his new interest rate became 11.2 percent and then was set to rise again in March to 12.2 percent, with more rises coming.Willie told the Kansas City Star:If the rates go up again, I can't afford it.Willie and his wife Ina would have to give up their home and move into an apartment. Willie now admits that he never fully understood how an adjustable rate worked when he agreed to the new loan. I will tell you, Mr. Clay, don't feel alone. There are a lot of people who do not understand the terms of their mortgage, and it is far too confusing under the system we have now.He said:I don't have the education to understand it. And they didn't explain it to me. I thought if the interest [rate] went down, your payment went down. If the interest rate went up, your payment stayed the same.Willie was now facing a mortgage payment 50 percent higher than when he started. He was trapped in his loan because there was a $2,500 prepayment penalty, which prevented him from getting out. This is not just Willie Clay's family crisis. The entire neighborhood is suffering through this housing crisis. There are more than 500 foreclosures in his ZIP Code alone. On Willie's block, there are already several empty houses.Foreclosed homes are dragging property values down for everyone. It is becoming a self-perpetuating downward spiral. That is why I felt so strongly about how we need to help these suffering families and neighborhoods. That is why we introduced the original Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act.The ``e,'' for education, focused on language meant to prevent this problem in the future, and that is the subject of the amendment that will be before us when we return to the bill.My amendment, representing the disclosure requirements from the SAFE Act that were not transferred to the Dodd-Shelby substitute, updates the Truth in Lending Act to modern times.The Bond amendment will apply to adjustable rate mortgages with an original fixed or teaser rate. This is the kind of loan Willie Clay had and millions of Americans across the country hold. For these types of adjustable rate loans with teasers, lenders or brokers will be required to provide in large, prominent type the loan's fixed interest rate, the initial fixed payment, and the date on which the fixed rate will expire. The lender or broker will also need to provide an estimate of what the payment will be when the loan resets from its initial teaser rate to a floating adjustable rate. For many subprime borrowers lured with a low teaser rate, this jump can be quite large, and borrowers should be aware of it. If they are not aware of it, then they should not be permitted to do the loan.What we are saying is, put the critical dollars-and-cents items in large type on the first one or two pages. Don't bury this in a whole bunch of legal mumbo-jumbo that we lawyers--my colleagues who are still lawyers--love to write to make sure we cover every possible contingency.The Bond amendment also requires lenders to disclose that there is no guarantee the loan can be refinanced before the initial fixed rate expires. Too many of the people in this trap now have said and told me and others that they were told there was no problem to refinance. Yes, there is a problem, and a lot of borrowers were caught when they found out they could not refinance. They did not know how high their rates could go after the teaser rate expired. Any concern they had that they could not afford their loan in the future was put to rest by the broker with a reassurance that there was no problem refinancing the loan before the teaser rate expired. For many, this turned out to be true, but when the credit market seized up and loan standards were raised, the rest were caught in this squeeze.The amendment I will ask this body to adopt requires a disclosure that there is no guarantee the borrower will be able to refinance the loan when the teaser rate expires.The Bond amendment also requires disclosure of any prepayment penalty, the amount, and its expiration date. Prepayment penalties is what caught Willie Clay and his family. While prepayment penalties can be good, giving certainty to the lender, who can in turn provide a lower interest rate, people need to be aware of what they are getting into and how it will be costly to get out.That is the theme of this entire amendment. It does not block adjustable rate mortgages. It does not block initial fixed rates. It allows prepayment penalties, an opportunity to refinance quickly.The advantages in the mortgage business have been good for consumers, allowing a new generation of home buyers to share the American dream. It just requires plain disclosure of loan terms so that people will know what they are getting into.Some may ask why we need to be prescriptive in telling brokers what to say and regulators what to require. That is because in this situation, current protections and oversight have failed. Brokers and lenders did not do enough to disclose to and educate consumers. Regulators also failed here, and they continue to fail. Neither HUD nor the Fed required disclosure of these terms in the past, neither sought to increase disclosures when the subprime crisis started, and neither's most recent proposal takes this on.The American consumer cannot wait while the bureaucracy, slow to move before, further delays and equivocates on what must be done now. What must be done is simple, straightforward disclosure of the most basic loan terms--rate, payment, new rate, new payment, penalties, and guarantees.These are basic consumer protections which I expect will help prevent a future home loan crisis and trapping of a large number of American families who are caught in this situation now. I urge my colleagues to adopt them and to support the Bond amendment when it is brought up.Mr. President, I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:29.976152,2015-03-17 19:11:29.976152,Senate,HOUSING PROBLEMS,2008-04-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-04-07/html/CREC-2008-04-07-pt1-PgS2620-3.htm,54,0,154,S2620-S2622,B000611,mr. bond
2848,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay congratulations to Anhueser-Busch Companies for their exemplary achievement in being named first among beverage companies in Fortune magazine's America's Most Admired Companies. Anhueser-Busch has been headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri, since its establishment in 1860, and has successfully served the community since that time. I am proud to represent Anhueser-Busch's dedicated employees in the Saint Louis community who work hard to continually raise the bar for beverage companies worldwide.Anhueser-Busch topped Fortune magazine's list of global beverage companies for the fifth consecutive year, rating first overall and first in eight of the nine categories considered: quality of products and services, people management, quality of management, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, long-term investment, and use of corporate assets.Anhueser-Busch also has several other distinctions in this global list. Among every company surveyed, which was more than 350 global companies spanning 26 industries, Anhueser-Busch ranked number one for quality of products and services and number two for social responsibility. Anheuser-Busch should also be applauded for its efforts to promote diversity in its workforce, as well as in the communities that it serves. Their commitment to being in the community, as well as of the community, has led Anhueser-Busch to support community-based organizations in efforts to inform, advance, and sustain their diverse communities.Contributing to the community and social responsibility have been very important actions for Anhueser-Busch since the company's beginnings, and the organization has quickly become a global industry leader in promoting responsibility. Since 1982, Anheuser-Busch and its nationwide network of more than 600 wholesalers have spent more than $675 million on developing more than two dozen alcohol awareness and education programs and initiatives designed to help prevent all forms of alcohol abuse, including illegal underage drinking and drunk driving. Working together with parents, educators, State and Federal regulators, law enforcement officials, and many others, Anheuser-Busch has continued its long-standing commitment to being part of the solution to these issues.Anheuser-Busch has also dedicated its facilities to operating in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner. At the Saint Louis area Anhueser-Busch brewery, more than 99 percent of the solid waste that is created is recycled. In addition, brewery water use has been cut by nearly 20 percent since 1990 and by more than 7 percent in the last 5 years, saving 4.7 billion liters of water.In times of crisis for the American people, Anhueser-Busch has established a reputation of being part of the recovery by providing a helping hand to our friends in their time of need. This tradition of giving began in 1906, when Aldolphus Busch donated funds to help San Francisco earthquake victims. More recently, Anhueser-Busch has donated drinking water and made monetary donations to the American Red Cross to aid in hurricane relief efforts in the Gulf Coast in 2005, as well as to wildfire relief efforts in California in 2007 and to tornado relief efforts in the South earlier this year. Since 1988, Anhueser-Busch has provided nearly 63.5 million cans of drinking water to various relief efforts.From these many examples, it is clear that Anhueser-Busch has rightfully earned the distinction of being named first among beverage companies as Fortune magazine's America's Most Admired Companies. I am proud to have worked directly with the dedicated employees of Anhueser-Busch in both Saint Louis, Missouri, as well as here in Washington, DC. I ask all Members of Congress to join me today in congratulating Anhueser-Busch for this extraordinary accomplishment and for their continued dedication to serving the American people.,2015-03-17 19:11:30.141263,2015-03-17 19:11:30.141263,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO ANHUESER-BUSCH COMPANIES FOR THEIR EXEMPLARY ACHIEVEMENT OF MAKING FORTUNE MAGAZINE'S LIST OF AMERICA'S MOST ADMIRED COMPANIES,2008-04-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-04-09/html/CREC-2008-04-09-pt1-PgE554-4.htm,56,0,154,E554,C001049,mr. clay
2849,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I congratulate the St. Louis Roadies soccer team on their recent participation in the Homeless USA Soccer Cup. The Roadies were the first team ever from St. Louis to participate in this special event, which was held last month here in Washington, DC. I had the privilege and honor to meet personally the entire team and their coaches from Peter and Paul Community Services in my office here on Capitol Hill before their competition. While the team did not capture the title, I am proud of their performance and representation of the St. Louis community and my home State of Missouri. However, I am even prouder of their personal perseverance and commitment to self-improvement after experiencing the terrible plight of homelessness.According to the organizers of the Homeless World Cup, about 77 percent of participants in the 48-team tournament go on to better their lives through employment, housing, education and/or drug and alcohol treatment. The founders of the event believe that it provides an opportunity for these men to express actively themselves through organized competition to build character and positive individuality. Based on their performance, I agree.The six-man team from St. Louis was made up of men who were recently homeless. Unfortunately, many others suffer from the plight of homelessness. It is frankly a national tragedy that we can and must end. Nevertheless, the spirit of the Roadies and others who participated in the Homeless Soccer USA Cup gives us significant hope that we can end homelessness.All six men and their coaches deserve high praise. I personally congratulate the six players, Oscar Grandberry, Daniel Blue, Doug Carter, Labon Smith, Marcus Davis, and Vince Steiniger; and the coaches, assistant coach Dena Emmanuelle, coach David Flomo, and coach Keith Deisner.Let me highlight one of the players named Oscar Grandberry who played goalie for the Roadies. His play earned him a spot on the U.S. national homeless team as an alternate. He is an amazing story of determination. Oscar is a native Liberian and former child soldier who is now on his way to completing a second master's degree from St. Louis University. Oscar and Team USA will travel to Melbourne, Australia, later this year to compete in the sixth annual Homeless World Cup and I wish them my best.The Roadies placed third in the beginners' bracket of the USA Cup and earned the Cup's Fair Play Award. This award is annually granted to the team ``showing the best in human spirit and embodying what the tournament is all about.'' As an addition to the already exceptional sporting culture of St. Louis and the State of Missouri, the Roadies are an inspiration to, and an excellent representation of, the great people of St. Louis. ,2015-03-17 19:11:30.401449,2015-03-17 19:11:30.401449,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2008-07-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-07-29/html/CREC-2008-07-29-pt1-PgS7625-2.htm,127,0,154,S7625,B000611,mr. bond
2850,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the achievements of Mr. Randall C. Ferguson, Jr., an important resident of the Fifth District of Missouri, which I am honored to represent. This week, Mr. Ferguson is to be inducted into the Missouri Walk of Fame during a reception as part of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, an event held to honor the achievements of African-Americans who have made significant contributions to Missouri. Randall is a retired executive from the IBM Corporation. He spent 29 years with IBM in various sales, management, and executive positions. His last position at IBM was senior location executive for the Kansas City region and senior state executive for Kansas and Missouri with responsibility for programs and policy implementation essential to IBM's interests, reputation and involvement relating to both the internal IBM community of 900 employees, and to the outside community. His responsibilities also included government relations, community relations, and all IBM philanthropic grants.After IBM, he was recruited to be the senior vice president for business growth and member connections for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. His responsibilities included membership, technology, small business activities, aviation, minority business alliances, the economic advisory board, and the world trade center.Randall holds a bachelor of science degree in business administration with honors from Walton School of Business, University of Arkansas. Throughout his life, Mr. Ferguson has exercised a tireless belief in the principle of putting ``others'' before ``self.'' He has put his principles to practice, and the effects of his efforts can be felt throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area. Recognizing his business acumen, Great Planes Energy, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and Shelter Insurance voted him on to their corporate boards.Civically, Randall serves on 12 boards in the greater Kansas City area with varied interests such as energy, healthcare, education, economic development and technology, employment, and diversity in such areas as race, sex, and religion. In all of his activities, he demonstrates his dedication and commitment to the greater good of others. His high energy pace translates directly to the results he is able to obtain for the benefit of all in the greater Kansas City area. Regardless of whether he is in the trenches or the boardroom, his poise and thoughtfulness is ever present. For those reasons and more, it is indeed an honor and a privilege to recognize Randall Ferguson, Jr. at the Missouri Walk of Fame reception, hosted by myself and fellow Missourian, U.S. Representative Wm. Lacy Clay of St. Louis.Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Mr. Randall Ferguson, Jr. and his endless commitment to serving the residents of the State of Missouri. He is a true role model not just to the African-American community in Missouri, but to the entire African-American community-at-large. May his success serve as a stepping-stone for many other African-Americans eager to be just as successful in their endeavors. While it is but a small acknowledgement for all of the work he has done, it is a heartfelt gesture to a heartfelt friend, taking strength from the lives he has touched in our hometown.,2015-03-17 19:11:30.652633,2015-03-17 19:11:30.652633,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF RANDALL C.

2851,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Madam Speaker, I thought it would be appropriate to make a comment or two about engineering because I was trained as an engineer. I must not have been much of one because I ended up in politics. It doesn't happen that often that people who have an engineering background end up in the political sector; but it is quite common in engineering for people to get the undergraduate degree and then to move into other kinds of areas, and the engineering background gives them a tremendous problem-solving basis to be able to be quite effective in various other kinds of careers.It is a national concern to us as Americans that we are producing fewer and fewer engineers. What happened was, in the era of Sputnik when I was a kid, everybody realized we were technologically behind, particularly behind the Soviet Union, and realized the urgency in having people develop an interest and background in science and engineering. At that time, we produced a good number of engineers, and they were fine engineers. They now work for many of our household-name large corporations, certainly many in my own district, Boeing Corporation, for example.These engineers have also started all kinds of different businesses and been very successful, and have been very successful in producing a lot of the technology that keeps our young men and women safe on the battlefields. It also is technology that has given us a wonderfully high standard of living and has allowed America to prosper in many ways.Unfortunately, now there is a tremendous dearth of engineers. We have a number of small companies that produce products that are related to the defense industry that I know of in the St. Louis area, just as an example, and they are saying that we would give anything to be able to hire engineers. We just can't get any of them. The only engineers we can get are coming out of India or some other country far away, and our own students, Americans, are not choosing careers in engineering. That is distressing.I suppose that there are reasons for why this is going on. Perhaps one of them is the malaise and the very lukewarm kind of results that we are getting out of secondary education in America. The SAT scores are continuously changed year to year, and they can be adjusted downward. Engineering is very rigorous. It requires an understanding of mathematics, and it is a very hard undergraduate degree. Many people that start in engineering end up in something like political science. It is far easier than engineering.But there are rewards in engineering, and if there are young people that are paying attention to what we are discussing here on the floor of the U.S. Congress today, I would encourage them that engineering is a fantastic undergraduate choice, and it doesn't have to end up behind a drawing board. It ends up in all kinds of positions and opportunities to those who have a disciplined mind and are capable of understanding basic principles of how things work.I have to say, in Congress it is tremendously helpful. I serve on the Committee on Armed Services, and we are constantly getting involved in technical kinds of questions, things like armor on Humvees, body armor, how to defeat IEDs, all of the technology of software and people tapping into databases. On the Science Committee, as well, we deal with all kinds of areas, everything from exploration of space to the simple use of materials.I would encourage all young people to seriously consider engineering.,2015-03-17 19:11:30.919817,2015-03-17 19:11:30.919817,House,SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK,2007-01-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-01-30/html/CREC-2007-01-30-pt1-PgH1004.htm,18,15,153,H1004-H1007,A000358,mr. akin
2852,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss and to support the Enumerated Powers Act introduced by Congressman Shadegg. The Enumerated Powers Act is most important to protect the tenth amendment. We understand that with the word ``federalism.''People perhaps, though, are not so aware of where the concept of federalism originally came from. They think some brilliant founders got together in Philadelphia in 1789 and came up with the idea of federalism, but, in fact, that is not quite true.The concept of federalism dates way, way back to 18 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims in the Plymouth Colony. It goes to the time when the State of Connecticut was being founded and a great preacher by the name of Hooker preached a series of sermons outlining how the government in Connecticut should be structured. Those sermons resulted in what was called then the ``Fundamental Orders of Connecticut.'' And what it said was that Hartford had certain enumerated powers and of anything not specifically enumerated for Hartford to handle, the other towns would have those powers.So it was that we started with the idea of federalism, that is, that there is only specific power granted to the central organizing authority, in this case the U.S. Constitution.Now, the Enumerated Powers Act requires that all bills introduced in the U.S. Congress include a statement setting forth the specific constitutional authority under which the law is being enacted. It would, of course, enforce, then, the reexamination of the proper role of the national government and it will fundamentally alter the ever-expanding reach of the Federal Government. The Enumerated Powers Act requires scrutiny of the Federal Government to slow this reach, particularly in the sense that it will require that there be a properly cited constitutional authority to precede the legislation proposed.Now, the Constitution gives the Federal Government only 18 specific enumerated powers. But ignoring the principles of Federalism in the Constitution, starting with FDR and continuing through LBJ's Great Society right down to the modern day, Congresses have displayed a willingness to ignore the 10th Amendment in order to greatly expand the Federal Government.The size and scope of the national government has exploded over the last seven decades. Congress has created ineffective costly programs, incredible annual deficits and a huge debt exceeding $7 trillion that will be passed only to our children and grandchildren. State and local governments are now dependent upon the Federal Government for funding, and the Feds now tamper with issues that are best understood by States and localities, with education and welfare reform being two cases in point.I believe that Ronald Reagan had it right: ``I have always felt that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'''We need to uphold the entire Constitution, not just the parts we choose to use for our own ends.,2015-03-17 19:11:31.198015,2015-03-17 19:11:31.198015,House,THE ENUMERATED POWERS ACT,2007-03-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-03-06/html/CREC-2007-03-06-pt1-PgH2214-2.htm,38,1,153,H2214-H2215,A000358,mr. akin
2853,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 477, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act and to honor the American Stroke Foundation (ASF). Founded in 1997 in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, the ASF supports stroke survivors, their families, caregivers and friends by providing resources, services, education and infom1ation that improves their quality of life.Every forty-five seconds, someone suffers from a stroke. Blood supply to the brain is interrupted, causing a loss of brain function and possibly brain damage. Every three minutes, someone dies from a stroke.Stroke is the number one cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in the United States. About 700,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year. Four out of five people in the U.S. either have had a stroke or know someone who has. My family, like the vast majority of American families, has been touched by stroke. I am proud to come before you today not only to express my commitment to doing all that is necessary to stop strokes, but to vote for an important step to ending this tragic disease.House Resolution 477, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act, establishes a national grant program and public awareness program to help each state ensure that patients have access to quality stroke prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services. I was proud to cosponsor and vote for this legislation in previous Congresses, and I am proud do so again this week.I would like America to know about a hometown hero, who has devoted her time, energy and amazing spirit to helping those disabled by stroke. After her husband Stan's stroke, Shirley Rose realized, as I did when stroke struck my family, that resources for recovering stroke survivors and their caregivers were painfully inadequate. Shirley did not dwell on the need and simply retreat in dismay. No, instead, Shirley founded the American Stroke Foundation and from their two locations in Kansas and Missouri, ASF has worked to improve the lives of stroke survivors by providing extended rehabilitation efforts, creating community programs, and educating the public about strokes. Shirley turned her desire for the best care for her husband and her personal need for a support network into an organization that helps thousands of Americans each year cope and recover from this often-debilitating disease.In 2002, thanks to efforts like those of the ASF, the United States had one of the lowest death rates for stroke. My home state of Missouri is fortunate to have one of the lowest fatality rates in the country. Regardless, I hope to see both of these numbers decrease as these essential programs are supported.Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the American Stroke Foundation and vote for this life-saving legislation, and I ask my colleagues to join me today in paying tribute to this life-saving and life-improving organization.,2015-03-17 19:11:31.341117,2015-03-17 19:11:31.341117,Extensions,HONORING THE AMERICAN STROKE FOUNDATION AND SHOWING SUPPORT FOR H.R. 477, THE STROKE TREATMENT AND ONGOING PREVENTION ACT,2007-03-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-03-30/html/CREC-2007-03-30-pt1-PgE697-3.htm,56,0,153,E697,C001061,mr. cleaver
2854,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my constituents, the Honorary Consul for the Slovak Republic, Mr. Ross P. Marine, for his tireless efforts to bring an important exhibition, focused on the fate of Slovak Jews during World War II, to the Kansas City area. Mr. Marine is a dynamic member of the Consular Corps of Greater Kansas City. And for this reason, the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area is very fortunate to have the vital and active Consular Corps of Greater Kansas City, which has been instrumental in fostering cultural exchanges while building economic partnerships between our area and other countries. Time and time again, Mr. Ross P. Marine has proven himself to be one of our most active and dedicated Honorary Consuls in our region.Years ago, while working for the Truman Medical Center East, Ross became involved in a health partnership program in the Republic of Slovakia, whose mission was to work with abused women and people addicted to drugs and alcohol. In the 3 years that followed, Ross became acquainted with the people and culture. He made many friends and in February 2001, he was honored with the title of Honorary Consul, for the four-state region of Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa. Currently, Ross Marine continues to be one of our metropolitan area's most important links to Eastern Europe. He has brought exhibits, business opportunities and international relationships with the Embassy of the Slovak Republic to the people of Missouri's Fifth District. At Ross Marine's request, the Slovak Ambassador to the United States made an official visit to Kansas City for the re-dedication of the Liberty Memorial in 2006, the only national World War I monument in the United States.Ross's latest endeavor was to spearhead efforts to bring the exhibition ``The Tragedy of Slovak Jews'' to Kansas City. This important exhibit is the first exhibition to illustrate the betrayal and atrocities committed towards Slovak Jews during World War II. Prepared and presented in cooperation with the National Czech and Slovak Museum and Library in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, this important exhibit was brought to the Kansas City area with the further assistance of the Czech and Slovak Club of Kansas City, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City, and the Midwest Center for Holocaust Education.Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Ross P. Marine for his relentless efforts in extending goodwill, not only within the areas surrounding the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, but to the global community. I urge my colleagues to please join me in expressing our appreciation to Mr. Marine and his endless commitment to the Slovak community. He is a true role model, not just to the Slovak-American community in Missouri, but to our entire society.,2015-03-17 19:11:31.641337,2015-03-17 19:11:31.641337,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MR.

2855,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 reauthorizes two economic development commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission. The bill also creates three new commissions, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission and the Northern Border Regional Commission.First, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton for working with me to add several counties in northwest Missouri to the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission and for working with other members of the committee to add their counties to the bill as well. I appreciate it very much.The Northern Great Plains Regional Commission borders my district in the north and the west. The counties added by this bill are contiguous to the counties in the commission. Additionally, these northwest Missouri counties are experiencing problems similar to the counties in the commission already, yet they have higher levels of economic distress.The Northern Great Plains Regional Commission will set the stage for economic growth by creating an effective Federal-State partnership for attracting new businesses, creating new jobs and developing the infrastructure in northwest Missouri. The commission will encourage local economic development by making use of local resources for the benefit of the community. The commission is designed to successfully leverage other public and private funds, providing northwest Missouri with a very valuable economic development tool.Economic development plays a very vital role in maintaining our rural way of life by keeping folks in those communities and keeping that culture alive. A major component to economic development is the build-out of broadband services throughout many regions in the country.No matter where you live, broadband can bring a world of opportunities and possibilities to your doorstep. It is imperative to our rural way of life that we push broadband out to every corner of the country. Where you live should not limit your opportunities for education, commerce, and medical care.Many citizens in rural America's small communities do not have broadband access at a reasonable cost. It should be available to everyone no matter where they live at a reasonable rate. Through this legislation and other efforts that my colleagues and I have taken on, grants will be available to further establish an infrastructure that can support this important tool to rural economic development.Additionally, I must commend two members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Hayes and Mr. Boustany, who have been tireless advocates for their districts. I would like to recognize Mr. Hayes for his dedication to stimulating economic development and job promotion in the State of North Carolina and leading efforts to create the Southeast Crescent Authority.Additionally, he has championed efforts to recruit new industry and create new jobs while sharpening the competitive proficiency of existing industries in the Eighth Congressional District of North Carolina.Mr. Boustany has also worked tirelessly to promote development and create opportunities for communities in his district and has been a leader on the issue for the entire State of Louisiana.Again, thank you, Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton for working with Members and working with me to bring this legislation to the floor.Mr. Speaker, I know we have a few speakers out there, so I will cut mine short.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:31.884508,2015-03-17 19:11:31.884508,House,REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007,2007-10-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-10-04/html/CREC-2007-10-04-pt1-PgH11270-2.htm,150,6,153,H11270-H11287,G000546,mr. graves
2856,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition and to commemorate one of Kansas City's premier radio stations 89.3 FM, KCUR Radio. Based at and operating from the University of Missouri--Kansas City campus, KCUR is celebrating its golden anniversary on October 21, 1957. I know that Congressman Dennis Moore of Kansas joins me in my well-wishes for KCUR as it has served the whole Kansas City community, on both sides of the state line 50 years of continuous service.At home, KCUR entertains, enlightens, and informs the Greater Kansas City metropolitan area. But more than that, quite simply, this radio station enhances the quality of life for Kansas Citians and all listeners by broadcasting over radio waves and the internet non-commercial radio programming 24 hours a day, including 20 hours of news each weekday, through its charter membership as a National Public Radio station. Continually, 89.3 FM is recognized for groundbreaking features and extensive coverage of politics, the arts, health, and minority matters. KCUR's original broadcasts and programs have captured the hearts and minds of listeners and learners nationwide.This heartland station has grown from a station with two full-time employees and a signal range of four miles, to 23 full-time broadcast professionals and 17 part-time employees with a signal reaching a 90-mile radius covering northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. Today, KCUR is broadcasting with a power of 100,000 watts to over 150,000 listeners all due largely through the efforts of its 200 tireless volunteers.KCUR began broadcasting October 21, 1957 from the third floor of Scofield Hall with a signal range of 4 miles, 2 full-time employees and a budget of $15,000 from the University. It was the first university licensed educational FM station in Missouri and the second FM in Kansas City.In the Spring of 1956, C.J. Stevens, then Director of Radio and TV at the University of Kansas City, submitted a budget request to establish and operate an educational FM broadcast station, and he was turned down. However, Stevens and Sam Scott decided to raise money outside the university. A modest fundraising campaign was undertaken and a separate FM fund was established. KCUR-FM was in its conception and continues to be a community station.In 1970, KCUR was awarded a grant of $7,500 from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for Community Service. National Public Radio broadcasts began the next year with KCUR as a charter member.After Sam Scott retired in 1986, the station was without a General Manager for a year while Jim Costin, UMKC Associate Vice Chancellor oversaw the station. Patricia Cahill, a former KCUR reporter in the early 1970s, was hired in 1987 as General Manager, and she holds the position today.In the 1960s, the Kansas City Times stated, ``In the community, (KCUR) it is a source of education, culture and pleasure.'' And those words still ring true today. I certainly know this firsthand. It is my radio station of choice, and this fact was never so clear, as well as my bias towards it, as when I had my daily radio show, Under the Clock, broadcast on its airwaves. Innovative programs, local heavy weights, and our community are their programming.Madam Speaker, I rise today with the gentleman from Kansas, Congressman Dennis Moore, and we are proud to share with you and the membership of this House our heartfelt congratulations and appreciation for KCUR's many outstanding benefits to our community, as we approach the 50th anniversary of this treasure in our community.,2015-03-17 19:11:32.139689,2015-03-17 19:11:32.139689,Extensions,COMMEMORATING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF KANSAS CITY'S KCUR RADIO STATION,2007-09-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-09-27/html/CREC-2007-09-27-pt1-PgE2000-4.htm,145,0,153,E2000-E2001,C001061,mr. cleaver
2857,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, 5 years ago Congress took steps to end the death tax. Now the American people expect us to finish the job.We need to end permanently the tax that punishes American values of savings and investment and of building small businesses and family farms and ranches.The death tax punishes the American dream--making it virtually impossible for the average American family to build wealth across generations. The death tax is anti-savings, anti-family, and anti-investment. It is quite simply un-American.If we don't act now, the death tax will come back in just a few years. Under current law the death tax is phased out in 2010 but comes back in full force in 2011. That is a ridiculous and untenable policy.The death tax should be completely and permanently repealed now in order to make the Tax Code fairer and simpler and to eliminate the harmful drag this tax has on the economy.According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 8 percent do not make it to a third.The death tax is one of the leading causes of the dissolution of small businesses.It hits those who own small businesses and family farmers the most. When faced with the death tax, farmers and ranchers are in an especially tough spot with most of their assets tied up in land and buildings, livestock and equipment. This gives them little flexibility when settling estates. Unlike an investor with a stock portfolio, they can't simply sell off a block of stocks and move on.We can all understand budget shortfalls due to a multitude of national and international events. But it is wrong to argue that we can shore up the budget by imposing a death tax on hard-working farmers and small business owners who are the backbone of the American economy.In reality, the death tax collects little revenue, less than 1.5 percent of Federal revenue.According to the CATO Institute, compliance with the death tax costs the economy about what the Treasury collects.A recent study analysis in 2005 by professors at Carnegie Mellon University suggest that repeal would cause a net increase in Federal revenues through dynamic growth effects and increased capital gains receipt.The Wall Street Journal has reported that repealing the death tax would create an extra 200,000 jobs per year.Debate usually focuses only on the taxes that estates actually pay, ignoring the real costs this tax imposes on owners of small businesses and family farms. These include estate-planning costs, compliance costs at death, and overall economic growth.Americans are paying millions of dollars every year to lawyers and accountants just hoping their children will not have to sell off the family business to pay the death taxes. Most small businesses and ranches will not be viable if the children have to sell off half to pay the tax.That money would be much better spent creating jobs, upgrading family farms, or saving for retirement or a child's college education.Eliminating the death tax is a matter of fairness.When folks work their entire lives to build up and pass on a business or family to their children, the kids should not get hit with a huge tax when they die. That is just not the American way.Americans overwhelmingly agree that it is wrong to tax property and earnings that have already been taxed before. Polls consistently show over 70 percent of Americans support repeal.Let's have the courage to separate death and taxes.,2015-03-17 19:11:32.384864,2015-03-17 19:11:32.384864,Senate,DEATH TAX REPEAL PERMANENCY ACT OF 2005--MOTION TO PROCEED,2006-06-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-06-08/html/CREC-2006-06-08-pt1-PgS5610-4.htm,72,25,152,S5610-S5629,B000611,mr. bond
2858,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,I agree with you that we are taxed heavily in this country, all the way from these Chambers, this Chamber all the way to city halls around the country. But I do believe in tax cuts, and I think that we would be wise or certainly we would have been wise to have some tax credits to the corporations who engage in a certain amount of research and development. I think if the tax credits can be linked to research and development, then we know that those dollars are going to recirculate, they are going to come back into the budget.I also think that we ought to give tax credits, that the one we had has expired, for parents who are sending their children to college, they ought to get tax credits. We are going to be locked into a very, very tough competitive battle with India, with China, with Japan, and even with Taiwan; and so we have got to educate as many children as possible, and we have got to make it easy for parents to pay for that college.But the reason we won't be able to do that, and this is another thing that should cause us to reconsider the tax cuts, is the interest payments on the debt. Now, the interest payments are obligatory, and it is right now the third largest expenditure in the United States Federal budget; and that is very, very dangerous. We can cut Veterans Affairs, we can cut homeland security, we can cut education; but we can't cut net interest because the interest on the debt is obligatory. And it doesn't matter what else happens economically in this country. We have got to pay at least the interest on the debt because the Chinese, the European market will not have an understanding that we are not paying this interest.And I also think that is extremely dangerous, because we are borrowing money from countries that in all likelihood we are going to have some difficulty with. We are even borrowing money, $50 billion so far, from OPEC.And how does this fit in with the tax cut? Well, the problem is that we are continuing to borrow money, taking money out of the budget with the tax cut, and the interest is rising. And the interest payments do in fact have a very, very direct impact on taxes. And we would obviously be able to lower taxes if we were able to lower the interest rate.We have become a debtor nation, and that is not healthy. We owe everybody around the world, and in fact we will end up borrowing $36 million during this 1-hour debate, $36 million during this one hour of debate. And when we are borrowing that kind of money and then giving tax cuts that will not come into the Federal coffers, it seems to me we are working against ourselves.,2015-03-17 19:11:32.640039,2015-03-17 19:11:32.640039,House,DEBATING REPUBLICAN TAX POLICY IN A CIVIL MANNER,2006-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-07-24/html/CREC-2006-07-24-pt1-PgH5664.htm,98,13,152,H5664-H5669,C001061,mr. cleaver

2861,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 419, which recognizes the efforts of the State of New York to establish the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor.And, I recognize the gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. Sue Kelly, the sponsor of this measure for her efforts. One might wonder why the state of New York is leading the effort to establish a center that focuses on the history and importance of this honored military award. The reason is simple, in the summer of 1782, during the Revolutionary War; General George Washington devised two new badges, one of which was the Badge of Military Merit, which we know today as the Purple Heart.General Washington at the time wrote ``. . . whenever any singularly meritorious action is performed, the author of it shall be permitted to wear on his facings over the left breast, the figure of a heart in purple cloth, or silk, edged with narrow lace or binding.'' Three soldiers are known to have received the original honor badge, Sergeant Daniel Bissell of the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of the Continental Line, Sergeant William Brown of the 5th Connectivity Regiment of the Continental Line, and Sergeant Elijah Churchill of the 2nd Continental Dragoons, also a Connecticut regiment. However, after the Revolution, the award feels into disuse and was not proposed for use again until after World War I.In 1927, Army Chief of Staff General Charles P. Summerall directed that proposed legislation be sent to Congress to revive the Badge of Military Merit. However, it was not until 1931, when General Summerall's successor, General Douglas MacArthur pushed forward the idea to reinstitute the badge. It was on the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth, February 22, 1932, that the War Department announced General Order No. 3, which established the Purple Heart.In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt extended the award to the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and established a uniform application of standards in the Army and Navy. President Harry S. Truman retroactively extended the eligibility for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard back to April 5, 1917, and in 1962, President John F.

2862,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Missouri congressional delegation, I would like to join with my colleagues, Representatives Todd Akin, Roy Blunt, Russ Carnahan, Emanuel Cleaver, Jo Ann Emerson, Sam Graves, Kenny Hulshof and Ike Skelton in paying tribute to the late Honorable Larry Gene Taylor who passed away at the age of 51 on Wednesday, July 6, 2005, after a hard fought battle with cancer. It is with great sadness that I stand before you today to commemorate the life of one of this nation's outstanding public servants. Senator Larry Gene Taylor served in both the Missouri House and Senate during his career. He was a man filled with optimism and vision and he was a legislator who was truly dedicated to the people of Missouri.Senator Taylor was born on August 7, 1953, in Carthage, Missouri. He was educated in the Sarcoxie public schools and went on to attend Missouri Southern University in Joplin, Missouri. Mr. Taylor was a driven man who started his career in politics working in State Treasurer Wendell Bailey's office as his Director of Public Affairs. He was later elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2002. As a State Representative he served as the Vice Chairman on the Tourism and Cultural Affairs Committee and as a majority member of the House Committee on Appropriations for Transportation and Economic Development and the House Committee on Job Creation and Economic Development.In 2004 he was elected to the State Senate where he was on several committees such as Aging, Families, Mental and Public Health, Ways and Means and Transportation. Senator Taylor worked vehemently to improve Missouri's infrastructure and played a key role in establishing a long term funding solution that greatly improved Missouri's education budget formula.Larry Gene Taylor was a public servant by blood. He inherited his love for politics from his father, the late U.S. Representative, Gene Taylor of Missouri's 7th Congressional District. Congressman Taylor was also a native Missourian who began his career in Missouri politics when he was elected mayor of Sarcoxie, Missouri in 1954. He spent the next 35 years of his life as a public servant holding numerous positions including that of a United States Congressman. Congressman Taylor retired from politics in 1989 and later passed away in 1998. Together this father and son team has left a great political legacy in the state of Missouri.In a time when politics is dividing so many, Senator Taylor was known as one who united. He was capable of working with anyone regardless of their political ideology or party affiliation. He possessed the true spirit of bipartisanship. Senator Taylor was never one to play party politics; he was devoted to the people of Missouri. The compassion and understanding that he showed to them will always be remembered through his work and the genuine heartfelt relationships that he developed.In spite of his bout with cancer, Senator Taylor's perseverance would not allow him to give up. In fact, many were astounded and moved by how he managed to work right through the unimaginable pain and suffering that he must have experienced. His love for life is truly an inspiration to all who had the opportunity to know him. Mr. Speaker, Senator Taylor was a source of great pride not just for Missourians but for Americans everywhere. Not only have I had the honor of working with Senator Larry Gene Taylor, I have had the privilege of calling him my friend.,2015-03-17 19:11:33.412594,2015-03-17 19:11:33.412594,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO A GREAT MISSOURI LEGISLATOR,2005-07-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-07-15/html/CREC-2005-07-15-pt1-PgE1499-4.htm,96,0,151,E1499-E1500,C001049,mr. clay
2863,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the achievements of Dr. Gayle Holliday, a constituent of the 5th District of Missouri which I am honored to represent. For over thirty years Gayle has dedicated her life to the Greater Kansas City, MO community, promoting and improving socio-economic conditions, political empowerment and civil rights of people of color.I recently had the opportunity to pay tribute to Gayle for her extraordinary commitment to community service. During the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 35th Annual Legislative Conference, I had the privilege of nominating Gayle for the Congressional Black Caucus Spouses' Celebration of Leadership Unsung Hero Award. While this award carries no monetary prize, it is no less a testament to her devotion to bettering our area.Helping her both personally and professionally is her tremendous educational background. Gayle holds a BA in Political Sciences, a Masters in Public Administration and a Ph.D. in Management and Applied Technology. Professionally, she is the President and owner of G &amp; H Consulting, LLC, which has been in business for over 10 years, helping clients in the public, private and non-profit sector with strategic planning and business plan development. Additionally, under President Clinton, Gayle was selected as one of a small group of individuals to represent the transportation industry on the President's transition team.Civically, Gayle serves on twelve boards in the Greater Kansas City area, with diverse interests such as issues of healthcare, education and economic development. Gayle has been happily and eagerly ready to help our community amassing more than 70 hours of community service each month. She is also a member of the church I pastor, St. James Methodist Church, and finds time to serve as chair of the Pastor Parish Staff Relations Committee.Dr. Holliday's work on behalf of others reaches from behind the scenes to the frontlines. In all of her activities, she demonstrates her dedication and commitment to the greater food of others. Her high energy pace translates directly to the results she is able to obtain for the benefit of all in our area. Regardless of whether she is in the trenches or the boardroom, her poise and thoughtfulness is ever present.Throughout her life, Gayle Holliday has exercised a tireless belief in the principle of putting ``other'' before ``self.'' But what separates Gayle from those who simply profess to hold a belief but do nothing to promote it, is that she has put her principles to practice, and the effects of her efforts can be felt throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area. That is why it was indeed an honor for me to be able to recognize her during the CBCF's Annual Legislative Conference. It is also why I am doubly honored to be able to recognize her here along with my colleagues, in the U.S. House of Representatives. While it is but a small acknowledgement for all of the work she has done, it is a heart-felt gesture, taking strength from the myriad lives she has touched in our hometown.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Dr. Gayle Holliday and her commitment to helping others. She is a living testament to the unspoken principle that defines unsung heroes: to be a great leader you must be a great servant.,2015-03-17 19:11:33.732846,2015-03-17 19:11:33.732846,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MS.

2864,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Associated Students of the University of Missouri (ASUM) on their 30th anniversary. Throughout their 30 years, this group of dedicated students has been the primary advocates for fellow undergraduates in the State of Missouri. Known as the student voice in the Missouri State government, the organization has been essential to craft and advance legislation that has benefited higher education in Missouri. In addition, ASUM has been the training ground for students interested in entering public service, the political arena, and is responsible for producing some of today's top government employees serving the State of Missouri.ASUM encourages students to become educated about the political process, and by doing so increases awareness, concern, and participation of young adults in democracy. ASUM's political action began on the campus of University of Missouri-Colombia in 1975. After successful participation by the students at the campus in Colombia, the student leaders expanded the organization to the other campuses within the University of Missouri System: Kansas City, St. Louis, and Rolla, where participation among the students exceeded expectations.Serving as the student voice in the federal government, state government, and on the various campuses of the University of Missouri, ASUM is responsible for the creating a student representative position on the University of Missouri Board of Curators. The student representative affords the opportunity for the Board of Curators to truly hear and value the students' perspective on issues affecting the University System. Keeping the student views in the forefront of Universities' agenda, the Board of Curators passed a policy allowing the ASUM student representative to attend closed board meetings. The over-arching impact of the policy addition was to remind the Board of Curators that every institutional change had to be in the best interest of the students.As the primary advocate of students in Missouri, the ASUM established though legislation the Bright Flight Scholarship, the most important source of financial aid for scholars from the State of Missouri. The annual $2,000 scholarship was created to encourage top ranked high school seniors to attend approved Missouri postsecondary schools. The program is geared to the top 3 percent of all Missouri high school students who have a minimum ACT score of 30 or a minimum SAT score of 780 math and 780 verbal. By requiring the student to maintain satisfactory academic progress and full time employment, this scholarship program helps the student to learn how to effectively manage their time and balance priorities. In addition to the Bright Flight Scholarship Program, the ASUM created Missouri State law to exempt sales taxes on textbooks, which has saved students in Missouri $6 million dollars every year since its enactment in 1999. Finally, the student political activists created a loan forgivingness program for teachers, medical doctors, and veterinarians who serve in high need areas of Missouri.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our heartfelt gratitude for the dedication of the Associated Students of the University of Missouri and their relentless efforts in extending their voices to represent all of the students of Missouri. It is essential for the members of the ASUM and other student organizations to be celebrated for their good works, for the students of today are truly our leaders of tomorrow.,2015-03-17 19:11:33.987998,2015-03-17 19:11:33.987998,Extensions,PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI,2005-11-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-11-03/html/CREC-2005-11-03-pt1-PgE2271.htm,144,0,151,E2271,C001061,mr. cleaver
2865,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise to honor SGM Frank Yoakum, who serves as the enlisted congressional, liaison for the Chief, National Guard Bureau. Sergeant Major Yoakum is the only enlisted legislative liaison in the Army, facilitating communication flow between the Army National Guard, National Guard Bureau, and elected officials on Capitol Hill, as well as their staffs and professional committee staff. He is on the personal staff of the Chief, National Guard Bureau. He began his military career by enlisting in the Regular Army in September 1971. He was trained in Infantry, Airborne, and Air Defense Artillery assignments, being released from Active Duty in July 1976. In June 1978, Sergeant Major Yoakum joined the Alaska Army National Guard and served in a military technician status as the administrative assistant to the state maintenance officer, and part-time as a flight operations coordinator with the 1898th Aviation Company, Attack. He moved to southeast Alaska and continued his service as a full-time Scout Battalion Attendant, Administrative Supply Technician, for Company B, 4th Battalion, 297th Infantry. He served in the Alaska Army National Guard until March 1981.In August 1983, he rejoined the Army National Guard in Phoenix AZ, working as a unit administrator and battalion supply sergeant. In October 1985, he entered Federal Active Guard Reserve status and was assigned to the United States Property and Fiscal Office Guam, where he served as military pay supervisor and logistics NCO. He transferred his membership from the Arizona Army National Guard to the Wyoming Army National Guard in March 1996. Further assignments in Federal AGR status included instructor/writer, operations NCO, force structure NCO, first sergeant, manpower NCO, training center liaison NCO, G-1 personnel policy sergeant major, and congressional liaison.Sergeant Major Yoakum holds an associate of arts degree in business administration from the University of Alaska and a bachelor of science degree in business administration from California Pacific University. He is a graduate of every level of NCO education up to and including the Sergeants Major Academy. Yoakum is a life member of the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States and a life member of the Wyoming National Guard Association. He has been inducted into the Honorable Order of Saint Barbara by the Field Artillery Association and the Order of Samuel Sharpe by the Ordnance Corps Association.As the former congressional liaison for the Chief, National Guard Bureau, my staff and I have found Sergeant Major Yoakum to be an invaluable resource and ally in advancing the interest of the Army National Guard. While his departure will be a major loss to the both NGB and the Federal Government, his new position as legislative director with the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the U.S. is well deserved. It is with admiration that I honor Sergeant Major Yoakum today and congratulate him on his retirement. I wish him and his family all the best. ,2015-03-17 19:11:34.241184,2015-03-17 19:11:34.241184,Senate,TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR FRANK YOAKUM,2005-12-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-12-16/html/CREC-2005-12-16-pt1-PgS13778-3.htm,162,0,151,S13778-S13779,B000611,mr. bond
2866,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise to today to discuss some disturbing news. According to a preliminary report released by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, infant mortality in the U.S. increased from 6.8 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2001 to a rate of 7.0 in 2002. This is the first time that the infant mortality rate has increased since 1958. Birth defects, preterm birth and low birthweight, and maternal complications of pregnancy were the major factors contributing to this increase.During the last session of Congress we passed legislation that I introduced with Senator Dodd to renew the Federal commitment to finding the causes of birth defects and preventing those for which we know the causes. I am very proud of the important work being conducted by the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the CDC in this area.Congress has not yet addressed the problem of premature birth and low birthweight. In 2002, more than 480,000 babies were born prematurely in the U.S 1 in 8 births. In my own State of Missouri, 12.7 percent of births are preterm, an increase of more than 11 percent over the last decade. Preterm labor can happen to any pregnant woman and the causes of nearly half of all preterm births are unknown.In January of 2003, the March of Dimes launched a 5-year, $75 million campaign to prevent preterm birth. Also supporting the campaign are the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses and 28 other national organizations. I cannot think of a better group of organizations to take on this serious public health problem. As significant as the March of Dimes campaign will be, success in reducing the incidence of prematurity requires a commitment from the Federal Government as well.I am pleased to be a cosponsor of vital legislation aimed at reducing the rates of preterm birth. The ``PREEMIE Act'' authorizes expansion of research into the causes and prevention of prematurity and increases Federal support of public and health professional education as well as support services related to prematurity.I would like to conclude by telling you the story of Jacqueline Reineri. Born 4 months premature, at just 24 weeks gestation, Jacqueline was given a very slim chance for survival. She was the size of a small doll, weighing just 1 lb., 10 ounces. Jacqueline had a grade-three brain bleed among many other complications and spent 96 days in the neonatal intensive care unit, NICU.Today, Jacqueline has Spastic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy and gets around in a power wheelchair. She has endured four major surgeries and will continue to experience many long-term effects of prematurity. While her family worries about her future, they feel blessed that she is a very intelligent second grader in a typical classroom and a very active advocate for prematurity and children with special needs, serving as the Missouri March of Dimes Ambassador.As inspiring as Jacqueline's story is many premature babies aren't as lucky. The recent increase in the rate of infant mortality underscores the importance of a comprehensive public-private effort to find the causes and ultimately prevent premature birth.I ask all of my colleagues to join me today in pledging to do all we can to ensure a day when all children are born healthy. ,2015-03-17 19:11:34.543398,2015-03-17 19:11:34.543398,Senate,INFANT MORTALITY RATE INCREASES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1958,2004-02-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-02-12/html/CREC-2004-02-12-pt1-PgS1276.htm,18,0,150,S1276-S1277,B000611,mr. bond
2867,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr Speaker, one of the privileges of serving as a member of Congress is that you work with some amazing people. The halls of our buildings are filled with bright and energetic Americans, and every now and then among them a true hero.By my definition, a hero is someone who would never use that word. Dudley Tademy, who is leaving the Armed Services Committee staff this week, fits that definition. But he fits anyone's definition of an honorable patriot.Before Dudley came to Capitol Hill, before he took on the job of overseeing the military's readiness for the Armed Services Committee, before he was the assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy, before all of those achievements that would be enough credit for any man, he was thirty years a soldier. As Captain Tademy, he served in Vietnam, and what service that was.Mr. Speaker, even those members not familiar with the details of that grueling war may have heard of Landing Zone X-Ray, and the la Drang Valley. They are familiar names, thanks to the book ``We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young.'' That story, of how the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) endured one of the most brutal engagements of that war, is also part of the story of Dudley Tademy. He was there. And as the fire support coordinator for the 3rd Brigade, he devised and directed the artillery plan that was central to holding the enemy at bay and creating an escape path for hundreds of overrun American soldiers. Across our country are men, their children, and grandchildren who would not be with us but for Dudley Tademy.As he said of that time, ``It's our job to get the job done and get those kids home safe.'' He brought that same dedication and mission to his work with the Armed Services Committee--always putting the soldier first.For the last ten years, he has carried a Herculean load on the committee staff. He oversees military readiness, now a $140 billion portfolio; all Department of Energy nuclear weapons related activities, another $16 billion annually; all Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs--that's another $18 billion--and matters concerning two of my favorite subjects, organization of the Department of Defense and professional military education. That's more oversight responsibility in one man than some entire full committees on the Hill! And there's nobody you or I would trust more to carry those astounding tasks.Nothing I or anyone can say here can do justice to Dudley Tademy's service, in uniform or after. Yet to speak with him, you would never guess at it. He is, in a word we don't use enough in Congress, humble. His gentle character and cheerful whistle belie a man of great discipline--still keeping up a daily physical training regimen, you'd never guess that he was older than most members. But he remains young in spirit, mentoring junior staff, and active in his church, where he counsels troubled youth.Now he can begin to devote proper time to Audrey, who does so much to keep Dudley humble. And instead of serving sixty committee members, Dudley's priority will be six grandchildren, and I believe they already have him more fully scheduled than we ever did.Best of all, we know that any time the Committee gets in a jam, we can call upon the inspiration of an American who has honored this Congress with his service. I salute Dudley Tademy, and know that all members will join me in gratitude for his company and devotion.,2015-03-17 19:11:34.807587,2015-03-17 19:11:34.807587,Extensions,REGARDING THE RETIREMENT OF DUDLEY L.

2868,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an agency that has supported Kansas City area children, families and communities for 110 years. The Mattie Rhodes Center provides social services, mental health counseling and provides emerging artists a venue for their work.The center is named for Mattie Rhodes, a young woman who worked for the less fortunate with a group of Sunday school friends call the Little Gleaners. In 1890, at the age of 19 she died of typhoid fever. Mattie left $500 to be used for the benefit of children. The Little Gleaners honored her wish and founded the Mattie Rhodes Memorial Society in 1894 with this pledge: ``I promise to do all I can to help the needy and suffering by working for them, learning about them, giving for them, and trying to interest others in them.''That pledge made 110 years ago remains a reality today. The mission of the Mattie Rhodes Center is to ``strengthen children, families and community by providing social services, mental health counseling and art experiences in a bilingual, culturally sensitive environment.'' Mattie Rhodes offers services such as individual and family counseling, Hispanic mental health programs, job readiness and placement and educational experiences for children. More than 650 individuals and families access family services each year through the Mattie Rhodes Center. The majority are of Mexican descent and are recent immigrants who speak little or no English. Each year more than 1,700 children benefit from mentoring programs, youth support groups and arts education geared to youth from the suburbs and Kansas City's urban core. The Mattie Rhodes Art Center continues to be a place where children can have fun, learn about, appreciate and create art. In 1999, the Mattie Rhodes Center reached out to Hispanic artists and art patrons by establishing the Mattie Rhodes Art Gallery. It provides a unique experience for Latino artists to display their work, and for the community to view and appreciate. The exhibits educate children and the public about the importance of Latino arts in the West Side community and the greater metropolitan area.Area daycare centers, elementary and high schools, community organizations and individuals constitute the broad based sector reached by Mattie Rhodes Center programs. These groups include Garcia School, McCoy School, Northeast High School, Rose Brooks Domestic Violence Shelter, Hand-In-Hand and the Missouri Division of Family Services, Hispanic artists and patrons.Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the Mattie Rhodes Center in Kansas City, Missouri for its 110 years of outstanding service. I congratulate this excellent organization in conjunction with The Mattie Rhodes Art of the Mask Auction on April 3, 2004. The auction has grown from a children's art center project into a community celebration. This year's auction will be the twelfth in Mattie Rhodes Center's history. I am proud to have contributed by creating a clay mask for the event.Ms. Mattie Rhodes would have been proud of these accomplishments. Eleven decades after her wish, the Mattie Rhodes Center continues to care for those less fortunate by providing programs that help children and families become more self reliant, confident, creative and productive members of their communities. From the humble beginnings of a committed young girl's dying wish to her name sake agency that now serves thousands of Kansas Citians, the Mattie Rhodes Center is keeping her promise alive and making a dramatic difference in the lives of the less fortunate.,2015-03-17 19:11:34.936673,2015-03-17 19:11:34.936673,Extensions,IN HONOR OF MATTIE RHODES CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF SERVICE IN 2004,2004-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-31/html/CREC-2004-03-31-pt1-PgE489.htm,43,0,150,E489,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2869,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the efforts of Dr. DeLois Weekes in ensuring quality cancer care in southwest Missouri and our Nation. Her unflagging commitment to improving cancer treatment should serve as a model, worthy of our admiration and appreciation.Cancer is a complex, multifaceted disease that can often best be treated by a multidisciplinary health care team specialized in oncology care, including nurses who are certified in that specialty. As a two-time cancer survivor, I have firsthand knowledge of the clinical, psychosocial, and supportive care oncology nurses provide to patients and their families. For the past three years, Dr. Weekes has served as President of the Cox College of Nursing and Health Sciences in Springfield, Missouri. In the course of her work in pediatric oncology nursing, she has been a teacher, administrator, speaker, advocate, researcher and author. Dr. Weekes' role as an educator and administrator has provided her with a unique opportunity to train these intelligent, highly skilled individuals, like the ones who helped me wage my own battle with cancer.The impact of Dr. Weekes' work, however, is not limited to southwest Missouri. She has helped advance the nursing profession by serving on the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) Board of Directors and developing grassroots programs that educate elementary school students about the meaningful and rewarding nursing profession. Her leadership within ONS, the largest organization of oncology health professionals in the world, has allowed her to help cancer patients around the globe. Since 1975, ONS has been dedicated to excellence in patient care, teaching, research, administration and education in the field of oncology. Dr. Weekes' position as a Director-at-Large on the ONS Board of Directors has enabled her to advance programs and policies that help ensure that America is has a well trained oncology nursing workforce. In Missouri alone, ONS has four chapters that serve the oncology nurses in the state and help them provide quality care to cancer patients and their families.Dr. Weekes' service and the ONS mission have never been more essential. This year alone, 1.3 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer. An additional 556,000 will lose their battle with this terrible disease. Today, more than two-thirds of cancer victims are over the age of 65, and the number of cancer cases diagnosed among senior citizens is projected to double by 2030. At the same time, many of our community-based cancer centers are facing significant barriers to hiring the specialized oncology nurses they need to treat their patients. It is estimated that there will be a shortage of 1.1 million nurses by the year 2015. As this date steadily approaches, Dr. Weekes' efforts to educate and prepare America's caregivers for positions in nursing, both in her work at Cox College and ONS, are ever more important.I commend Dr. DeLois Weekes for her commitment to providing and improving cancer care, and I urge all of my colleagues to support oncology nurses across the country.,2015-03-17 19:11:35.169839,2015-03-17 19:11:35.169839,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO DR.

2870,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) for her remarks on Mr. Colmery.Mr. Speaker, it is never too late to honor someone who has done a great deed for our Nation. Harry W. Colmery should be honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom because millions of Americans are better off today as a result of his vision and the hard work he put in to making his dream a reality.After returning from duty in the Air Service during World War I, Mr. Colmery was struck by the financial and emotional hardships he and his fellow veterans encountered when they returned home. These hardships included trouble adjusting to civilian life and the inability to find adequate jobs.Holding a law degree and therefore in better shape than most veterans, Mr. Colmery immediately became involved in the newly formed American Legion, where he helped fellow veterans who were less fortunate than he was. He held several legion posts before being named National Commander in 1936.As more and more young men were drafted into service during World War II, Harry Colmery began to think of his own experiences and how he could improve the lives of American veterans when they returned from war. He led efforts to make sure that these fine young men who had risked their lives for the freedom America enjoys would best benefit from that freedom when they returned.In December 1943, Colmery called an emergency meeting of the American Legion leadership. Colmery drafted legislation that would become the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, known today as the G.I. Bill of Rights.The G.I. Bill of Rights is considered to be one of the core reasons that the 15 million U.S. soldiers active during World War II were able to return to America and lead productive lives.Since its enactment, the G.I. Bill of Rights has provided education and training for 7.8 million men and women. For the first time some of our Nation's most elite universities became available to working class Americans through the G.I.

2871,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, as we return to session following a productive August among the people we represent, it is worth remembering that for the most part, the staff of the House has been here and working through the month.I believe we do not recognize often enough those dedicated public servants, who get lumped into that antiseptic word ``staff.'' Among the staff of the House are leading experts in their fields, prize winners, men and women noted in their own right for achievements both professional and prosaic. Many know far more in their fields of expertise than any Member of Congress ever will. And yet they bite their lips and say ``Yes, sir,'' when we hear their counsel yet choose to go another way.Perhaps the greatest tribute to the selflessness of the staff is the fact that almost any one of them could leave this place tomorrow for jobs with better pay, better recognition, and much better hours, yet their dedication to the common weal binds them to this House. And we Members all wind up looking the better for it.Fortunately, while we may not say ``thank you'' often enough, others sometimes take up the slack. And so it is with Debra Wada, a member of the Armed Services Committee staff.Debra handles matters concerning military personnel for the committee, and does so with zeal and knowledge and grace. She is always looking out for the common soldier. Millions of Americans in uniform owe the improvement of their pay and benefits to Debra and her foresight and dedication. I trust her guidance, and even more admire the energy with which she works and lives.I am not alone in that sentiment. Not long ago, Debra was recognized by the National Guard Association of the United States, who presented her with their Militia Award. In their words, she was selected ``for her exceptional dedication and effort to improve the status, welfare and professionalism of the enlisted members of the National Guard of the United States.'' That is indeed an honorable achievement, particularly at a time when military personnel are working so hard on our behalf.While the Association did not formally recognize the effervescent personality that suffuses her work and brings joy to those around her, I have no doubt that those qualities played a role in her selection as well.Debra has overcome a great obstacle to get where she is today; she was formerly employed in the other body of Congress. I compliment her on surmounting this challenge.Mr. Speaker, people wonder how Members of Congress can vote one minute on education, the next on health, the next on defense, and understand so many issues in enough depth to make good decisions. The answer is that we are all fortunate to be surrounded by an ocean of talent. People like Debra Wada make our job possible. I salute her not only for her award, but for the unrecognized work that she and other staff professionals perform all year round.,2015-03-17 19:11:35.547111,2015-03-17 19:11:35.547111,Extensions,REGARDING PRESENTATION OF THE MILITIA AWARD TO DEBRA WADA,2004-09-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-09-08/html/CREC-2004-09-08-pt1-PgE1542-4.htm,105,0,150,E1542-E1543,S000465,mr. skelton
2872,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate the services of the Consulate General of Japan at Kansas City to the six-state region of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota and to note, with sadness, the closing of the Consulate as of December 31, 2004.Since the Japanese Pavilion at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair first intrigued and delighted tens of thousands of visitors, the links between Japan and the heart of the American Midwest have grown in strength and diversity. As investment, trade and educational exchanges have increased over the last 50 years, so too have the number and scope of contacts and contracts between these six states and Japan.The Japanese government has been proud to host Governors from the six-state region as honored guests, along with United States Senators and Representatives, business leaders and leading scholars. In return, Ambassadors, Diet members, and even the Emperor and Empress of Japan have visited the heart of America. But there is much more to the relationship than VIP visits and official statements. The Consulate General of Japan at Kansas City has served the six-state region for 25 years in promoting economic development, fostering cultural exchange and understanding, and in providing consular services to the Japanese citizens and U.S. citizens in this region.More than one hundred Japanese companies have operations within the region and the Consulate has been a significant factor in facilitating and encouraging such investments to the economic benefit of the region through increased employment and economic activity. These companies employ over six thousand Americans. Exports out of the region to Japan exceed $900 million per year.The Consulate has actively promoted and sponsored cultural fairs and activities throughout the region to foster better cultural understanding and exchange. Examples of cultural activities are the Annual St. Louis Japanese Festival and the Greater Kansas City Japan Festival. The Consulate has assisted almost three hundred regional educators to experience Japan first hand through the Fulbright Memorial Teachers Program. Over eight hundred Americans have participated in the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program. Nearly 100 university and graduate students have participated in scholarship programs provided by the Ministry of Education of Japan. Currently, almost 2,000 Japanese university students are enrolled in public and private universities throughout the 6-state region. In addition, the Consulate has coordinated cultural gifts in the form of gardens, gateways, and statuary to numerous local communities. The Consulate has supported and promoted 28 different sister cities and sister state relationships.The Consulate has provided consular services to the 4,500 Japanese nationals living in the six-state region and, over the years, the Consulate has issued more than 30,000 visas to American citizens wishing to work, study, or live in Japan.Over the last 25 years, the Consulate has been active in working to resolve trade issues specific to the region and, as an example, the current Consul General, Takao Shibata, has been actively involved in efforts to resolve beef trade limitations imposed out of concern for BSE exposure.Since arriving in Kansas City in July 2002, Consul General Takao Shibata and his lovely wife Mieko Shibata have become a valuable part of our community. They will be missed by me and the citizens of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District.The people of Kansas City and the six-state region regret the closing of the Consulate, but we look forward to a continuation of our close relationship with Japan, and the provision of consular services by the Consulate General of Japan at Chicago.,2015-03-17 19:11:35.770265,2015-03-17 19:11:35.770265,Extensions,COMMEMORATING THE CONSULATE GENERAL OF JAPAN AT KANSAS CITY,2004-12-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-12-07/html/CREC-2004-12-07-pt1-PgE2198.htm,138,0,150,E2198,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2873,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I fulfill the pledge I made to the citizens of southern Missouri to introduce and work tirelessly to pass an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, that requires a balanced Federal budget. Over the course of the past several decades, fiscal irresponsibility has produced a Federal debt that is fast approaching $5 trillion. That's trillion, with a `t,' Mr. Speaker. A debt of $5 trillion is a mind-boggling figure, but it can be placed in a much clearer perspective. A child born today immediately inherits nearly $20,000 of debt, owed directly to Uncle Sam. The same is true for every American. The era of continuing annual budget deficits must end, and it is clear that the only way to restore conservative fiscal values to the Nation's budget is to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.The stakes in this debate could not be more important. The fiscal future of the United States hinges on the ability of Congress and the President to make the difficult choices required to balance the Federal budget. It's more than debating trillion dollar figures. It's about making our economy stronger and providing every working American family with a better chance to make ends meet. A balanced budget will strengthen every sector of our economy with lower interest rates that will help families stretch each paycheck further. Home mortgages, automobiles, and a better education will become more affordable to every working family, making the American Dream closer to reality for all.Mr. Speaker, I am committed to working with my colleagues in the new Congress to see that the balanced budget constitutional amendment is passed and sent to the States for ratification. A constitutional amendment is certainly no substitute for direct action on the part of the Congress. However, we have seen time and time again instances where those who object to conservative fiscal responsibility find convenient excuses to deny the American people a balanced budget. An unbreakable enforcement mechanism is clearly needed to ensure that those who would continue to spend our children's future further into debt are not able to do so.I also want to make plain that the Social Security trust fund has no place in this debate. The independent trust fund is a sacred trust between generations and must never be used to balance the budget or hide the true size of the deficit.Commonsense conservatives in Congress and the American people are committed to balancing the budget. I look forward to working throughout this session with all of my colleagues and the White House to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment on a bipartisan basis. The obligations we owe to hard working American families, their children, and our Nation's future generations deserve nothing less than decisive action to preserve our future by balancing the budget. A constitutional amendment will ensure this outcome.,2015-03-17 19:11:35.992429,2015-03-17 19:11:35.992429,Extensions,BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET,2003-01-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-01-08/html/CREC-2003-01-08-pt1-PgE7-4.htm,2,0,149,E7-E8,E000172,mrs. emerson
2874,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) who spoke last has regaled us on a number of occasions with some interesting and I would say provocative speeches over the last couple of years about the use and abuse of tax shelters. He has proclaimed himself, Mr. Speaker, the defender of the individual taxpayer against abusive corporate tax shelters. He has often cited Enron when that issue was before Congress. He has railed against the expansion of the business meal deduction, saying taxpayers would subsidize $400 bottles of wine, a thinly-veiled swipe at the former Speaker.In the immediate aftermath of September 11, in the committee he went as far as to say that Republicans on the committee were looking for tax cuts for Osama bin Laden. Now he attempts to wrap himself into the fireman's coat and shield himself with the policeman's shield. It is just not so.Section 418 of the Social Security Protection Act closes a loophole. The General Accounting Office says this about that loophole: ``4,819 individuals from Texas and Georgia have performed work in Social Security-covered positions for short periods, and in fact even for a day, in order to offset'' or get away from this government pension offset in this exemption.This is a loophole, a loophole that is being exploited. In 2002, one-fourth of all the public education retirees in the State of Texas took advantage of this loophole.Let me give an example of an egregious type of way that this is being exploited, and unfortunately, much to the chagrin of other hardworking Social Security payees across the country. School officials reported individuals were taking, or one individual traveled 800 miles one way, 800 miles, a two-day trip, to be employed for a single day, traveling back 800 miles back to that person's home in order to get away from this loophole.As my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), noted, a lot of these school districts are seeing the money flow in because they are charging these retirees, these teachers, a processing fee for their school districts. Ultimately, what it means is that these workers are seeing their annual pensions increased by the tune of about $5,000 a year to which they are not entitled.So we can talk about the government pension offset all we would like, or the windfall elimination provision. Yet what we are trying to do is root out waste, fraud and abuse. The General Accounting Office has told us clearly and unequivocally this is a loophole that is being exploited, and it is time that this Congress acted to close this loophole, because other retirees are the ones that are losing the advantage of their social security.,2015-03-17 19:11:36.125524,2015-03-17 19:11:36.125524,House,SOCIAL SECURITY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003,2003-04-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-02/html/CREC-2003-04-02-pt1-PgH2625-3.htm,53,18,149,H2625-H2669,H000948,mr. hulshof
2875,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4737, the bill before us today, and in support of the Democratic alternative.In a time when the States are already facing serious budget cuts, this bill exacerbates their budget woes. Missouri, my State, would have to come up with over $316 million to implement the mandates in this bill, but it is already facing a $536 million budget deficit. The bill before us inadequately funds many of the programs and block grant monies States need in order to carry out welfare reform and improve upon it.I supported the original welfare reform bill 5 years ago. I worked hard on the issue of ending unfunded Federal mandates in this House and was proud when we adopted it into law, and I am very chagrined and worried about what we are attempting to accomplish in this bill today.The Democratic substitute provides both inflationary increases in our block grants and increases child care funding by $11 billion over 5 years.We must, if we are going to expect our welfare recipients to stay in the work force, provide these services.The progress we have made as a result of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which I supported, will be undermined by this measure. It imposes up to $11 billion in unfunded mandates on the States over the next 5 years. Missouri has been recognized nationally for its creative community-based partnerships with youth mentoring, before and after school programs, parenting classes and child development classes, all of which foster independence from public assistance and improve family well-being. Missouri also makes excellent use of case-by-case individual assessments, which assists in making the transition to work by offering job training, post secondary education, and job placement services. H.R. 4737 takes away Missouri's flexibility in providing these programs by eliminating educational and occupational opportunities that contribute to the outreach the State now provides.The Democratic substitute provides both an inflationary increase in the TANF block grant, and additional $6 billion over 5 years, and increases child care funding by $11 billion over 5 years. H.R. 4737 adds no new money for childcare. My constituent Marcia, a mother of three, came to Missouri's Department of Family Services shortly after she and her family moved to Missouri to escape an abusive husband. The Democratic substitute gives Marcia the comfort in knowing that while she is working to improve her family's quality of life and getting support for her abusive situation her children will be cared for. Without adequate childcare, welfare recipients who find themselves in situations like Marcia's will not be able to meet the increased work requirements mandated on them by H.R. 4737.If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle truly want self sufficiency I urge them to adopt the Democratic substitute.Mr. Speaker, stricter work requirements with fewer resources is a losing equation for the welfare mothers of Kansas City and for the children of our Nation.,2015-03-17 19:11:36.336667,2015-03-17 19:11:36.336667,House,PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK, AND FAMILY PROMOTION ACT OF 2002,2002-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-05-16/html/CREC-2002-05-16-pt1-PgH2517-5.htm,63,126,148,H2517-H2590,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2876,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the International Association of Lions Clubs who will observe May 30th as Lions Youth Appreciation Day. Since 1917, Lions have served the world's population through hard work and commitment making a difference in the lives of people everywhere. With 1.4 million members serving in more than 44,600 clubs in 188 countries and geographical areas, Lions are recognized worldwide for their service to the blind and visually impaired. More than 139,000 of these members are young people between the ages of 12 and 28, and I congratulate these youth for their commitment to others.Lions Club International was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1917 and is the world's largest service club organization. Since that time, their Code of Ethics has guided the members in their quests to create and foster a spirit of understanding among the peoples of the world, promoting a world of compassion and tolerance. The Lions' International slogan is ``Liberty, Intelligence, Our Nation's Safety (LIONS).'' With over 15 Lions clubs in my district, the Youth Lions aim to provide young people of the world with opportunities for achievement, learning, and service, individually and collectively, through sponsorship of activities identified as best practices in the field of youth development. Evolving from the founding Lions' steadfast dedication to the blind and visually impaired, the Youth Lions have devoted their energy to a wide variety of philanthropic causes.The Lions Club of Jackson, Platte, Clay and Cass Counties in Missouri are sponsoring a Youth Appreciation Night on May 30th, with special guest, Lions International President J. Frank Moore. His leadership theme, ``Light the Path'' focuses on implementation of several youth programs. Among the programs that have been particularly successful include: Leos and the Lions International Peace Poster Contest. Leos are young men and women of good character, ages 12 to 28, who are dedicated to making a difference in their communities. The peace poster contest was created in 1988 to give young people an opportunity to express their feelings and desire for peace. Since then, more than two million children from approximately 65 countries have participated in the annual contest.The activities the youth Lions have taken part in deserve to be recognized. Cutting across all national, racial and cultural boundaries, Youth Lions activities have included work with the visually impaired, programs including drug education and prevention, diabetes detection and research, and work for international cooperation and understanding.Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in saying ``Congratulations and Thank you'' to the International Association of Lions Clubs on Lions Youth Appreciation Day.

2877,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the work and amazing accomplishment of a Franciscan nun who has left a lasting mark on Springfield, Missouri. She has overcome adversity and criticism to win the respect of many of her peers by creating important social services that have helped the less fortunate people of Springfield, Missouri.In 1983, Sister Lorraine Biebel took on the temporary assignment of opening a soup kitchen in Springfield. Since then, Sister Lorraine has remained at the helm of what has become known as the Kitchen Ministry. Today the ministry that Sister Lorraine started has a $3.5 million budget, nine buildings, a small army of volunteers and a reputation for helping anyone with a legitimate need.Sister Lorraine has been a vigilant visionary and leader to meet the demands of those less fortunate. It has been a labor of love and faith. Biebel's holistic approach has seen the conversion of an old hotel into a 90-room shelter with three dormitories and transitional housing. The Family Nurturing Center offers childcare for infants and pre-schoolers, as well as after school programs. There are also counseling services, walk-in medical services, dental clinics, and mental health counseling. In addition, it offers referral services, job programs, out reach programs for at-risk youth, literacy and GED training. Sister Lorraine helped to create a free store for residents and a thrift store for the community that offers free household items, clothing, and food for those people trying to improve their family unit or get back on their feet.In praise of the God she serves, Sister Lorraine's faith is what has driven her to these accomplishments. Sister Lorraine has been a tireless servant of God's compassion for the disadvantaged, the homeless, and the countless volunteers who have rallied to support the programs.With the naming of her successor, Tobias Meeker, Sister Lorraine is retiring but her work will not end. She hopes to reactivate the Little Portion Retreat Center where she lives in Republic, Missouri. There she promises to continue to nurture the spiritual health of others in a less stressful environment.Sister Lorraine Biebel and the Kitchen Ministry are a wonderful example of the substantial social changes faith based initiatives can bring to a community's less fortunate population. Working with the federal and state government, local charities, churches of many denominations, and generous donors, Sister Lorraine has molded a multifaceted ministry that provides shelter, clothing, health care, counseling, education, job skill training, and spiritual guidance. The Kitchen Ministries have professionally and cost-effectively provided these services and care in a manner in which the federal government could not. The ministry is the work of many caring people, led by a woman of great faith whose work has touched thousands of lives.We wish Sister Lorraine good health and best wishes in her retirement.,2015-03-17 19:11:36.661905,2015-03-17 19:11:36.661905,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO SISTER LORRAINE BIEBEL,2002-09-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-12/html/CREC-2002-09-12-pt1-PgE1568-5.htm,115,0,148,E1568,B000575,mr. blunt
2878,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2002. It is a pleasure to work, once again, on this important issue with Senators Dodd, Kennedy and Frist.My interest in birth defects prevention began while I was Governor. As Governor I had secured dollars to fund the neonate care units at our hospitals in Missouri. These remarkable institutions and the dedicated men and women who serve there do a tremendous job of saving low birth weight babies and babies with severe birth defects.As I visited those hospitals and held those tiny babies, the doctors and nurses who staffed these units asked me, ``Why don't we do something to reduce the incidents of birth defects and the problems that bring the tiniest of infants to these very high-tech, specialized care units.''Since I became a Senator I have been working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with the March of Dimes to deal with this serious and compelling health problem facing America. Many people are not aware that birth defects affect over 3 percent of all births in America, and they are the leading cause of infant death.This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a birth defect. Among the babies who survive, birth defects often result in lifelong disability. Medical care, special education, and many other services are often required into adulthood, costing families thousands of dollars each year.In 1992, due to a terrible tradegy in Texas when at least 30 infants were born without or with little brain tissue over a short period of time, I introduced the Birth Defects Prevention Act.Because at the time Texas did not have a birth defects surveillance system, and because our country did not have a comprehensive birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy, the severity of the problem was not recognized until the incidence of birth defects was so high that it was difficult to miss.In 1998, we passed the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which created a federal birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy. That was followed by the Children's Health Act of 2000, which established the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at CDC. With these two important pieces of legislation Congress for the first time recognized that birth defect and developmental disabilities are major threats to children's health.As a result, CDC, through eight regional Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention are collaborating on the largest study on the causes of birth defects ever undertaken, the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. CDC is also assisting 28 States by providing 3-year grants to improve their surveillance systems. We have come a long way in the past 5 years toward preventing certain birth defects, but we face many challenges ahead.There is still much work to be done to improve the health of all Americans by preventing birth defects and developmental disabilities in children, promoting optimal child development and ensuring health and wellness among child and adults living with disabilities.Today, with the introduction of this bill we have the opportunity to renew our commitment to birth defects prevention and to improve the quality of life of those living with disabilities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure and enhance the well-being of our Nation's children.,2015-03-17 19:11:36.982132,2015-03-17 19:11:36.982132,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2002-09-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-19/html/CREC-2002-09-19-pt1-PgS8920.htm,119,5,148,S8920-S8933,B000611,mr. bond

2880,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I wish today to pay tribute to an American Jazz legend, Mr. Clarence ``Sonny'' Kenner. Regrettably, Mr. Kenner died earlier this month, but his inspiring music will live on for generations to come.His standing room only celebration in Kansas City January 29 began with a two hour ``Jam Session'' where local musicians who had played with Sonny over the past 50 years shared his favorites, such as ``Sunny Side of the Street.'' His fellow musicians said Sonny was all about sharing when he played. It was love he was sharing--his love through music. An example of Sonny's love for music was his appearance earlier this year at The Levee where he ``jammed'' with fellow artists while battling his health issues.In his eulogy, Reverend Sam Mann of Saint Mark's Church spoke from the Book of Numbers in the Bible, Chapter 6, verses 24 to 26 referring to Sonny's sweet face and the scripture's message: ``. . . the Lord make his face to shine upon you . . . lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.'' Rev. Mann said, ``Whenever you saw Sonny's face, his countenance was one of purity, graciousness, and peace, his face would shine.'' Sonny's face revealed his innermost insight and when he met persons, he looked at them ``face to face.''We all will remember Sonny for his musical genius and his contributions to the music industry. Some of his works include writing, arranging, conducting, and producing, ``Never Give Up On Love,'' and ``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow.'' His last CD titled ``Peace, Love, and Happiness'' embodies his life and willingness to give back to others, especially our children. Sonny, a loving and caring human being who always looked at life with smiling eyes. I will remember him as a true humanitarian who championed a cause very dear to my heart, music education. He spent countless hours in schools throughout our community inspiring the next generation of music greats.He toured throughout the country allowing his gifts to enrich the lives of others. He attained a national following from engagements at venues which included the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the Apollo Theater in New York, Bop City in San Francisco, and prestigious settings in Baltimore, Washington, DC, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and with the U.S. Armed Services 8th Division Band in Germany. He appeared and recorded with world renowned artists such as Sam Cooke, Quincy Jones, Mahalia Jackson, Big Joe Turner, and Jay McShann to name a few. Whether it was jazz, classical, or rock, Sonny Kenner's recordings and performances were widely recognized and enjoyed.In addition to his own six children, he was loved by the children of Kansas City because as his daughter said, ``Sonny was Love to them.'' He was all about love. He was all about sharing. When he played, it was love he was sharing through his music. He leaves behind a legacy of unmatched talent and service to the music industry, to Kansas City, and to the hearts of all who knew him.Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating a great musician and great humanitarian who will be remembered by music lovers, friends, and fans everywhere for the warmth of his smile shining from the ``Sonny side of the street.'' His jam sessions at The Levee have ended, but he's puttin' it together for the artists when they join him in his new gig.,2015-03-17 19:11:37.436455,2015-03-17 19:11:37.436455,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF CLARENCE ``SONNY'' KENNER,2001-01-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-01-31/html/CREC-2001-01-31-pt1-PgE72-3.htm,13,0,147,E72-E73,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2881,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus today to voice my deep concerns regarding the nomination of John Ashcroft for Attorney General of the United States.I want to also commend my colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones) for her leadership with the CBC Task Force on this nomination and for scheduling this special order.Mr. Speaker, our Constitution states that the President has the right to nominate individuals whom he chooses to be in his cabinet. Likewise, the Senate has the right and duty to advise and consent on those nominations as it sees fit.But I am a congressman from Missouri, a place known as the ``show me'' State, and I am not easily convinced. I will wait to see which John Ashcroft shows up as Attorney General, the John Ashcroft who appeared at the confirmation hearing, or the one who I served with in Missouri State government. Because those are two very different men.Evidently, former Senator Ashcroft has had a sudden epiphany, one which miraculously coincided with his confirmation hearing. He has apparently undergone a great conversion on a wide range of issues that he has consistently opposed in the past, issues such as civil rights, school desegregation, voting rights, reproductive choice, and equal protection for all Americans, including those of a different sexual orientation.But the John Ashcroft that I served with when he was Missouri attorney general and governor was not at the confirmation hearing we witnessed.I know what John Ashcroft's real record as a public servant has been because I was there. His public record shows a pattern of extremism that has deprived many children of a quality education. He squandered millions of tax dollars and harmed our State by using racially divisive political tactics.But for now, I will take Senator Ashcroft at his word that as U.S. Attorney General, he will enforce all Federal laws vigorously, regardless of his personal views and past record.I hope that both President Bush and former Senator Ashcroft are sincere in their intent to use the law as a healing force in this country. And to demonstrate that sincerity, I challenge the President and Senator Ashcroft to put their words into action by renominating Justice Ronnie White to the Federal bench.Americans are still divided following a bitter election, and this current nomination process has deepened the divisions across our country. Renominating Justice White would provide a powerful act of healing. It would show the American people that the new administration is serious about bringing our Nation together.I urge the President to take advantage of this unique opportunity and demonstrate the compassion he so frequently refers to. And I hope that former Senator Ashcroft will encourage him to do so.,2015-03-17 19:11:37.569550,2015-03-17 19:11:37.569550,House,IN OPPOSITION TO CONFIRMATION OF SENATOR ASHCROFT FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL,2001-01-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-01-31/html/CREC-2001-01-31-pt1-PgH147.htm,13,8,147,H147-H154,C001049,mr. clay
2882,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that I inform the House of Representatives of the passing of my good friend The Honorable Lynn M. Ewing Jr. of Nevada, Missouri.

2883,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a young lady who has brought praise and honor to the sport of basketball and to Southwest Missouri State University by becoming the nation's all-time leading scorer in women's NCAA Division I basketballJackie Stiles has been among the leading scorers in women's college basketball for four years. Her 31 points per game average is the best in the nation this year. She was the leading women's scorer last year and ranked second in the nation in her sophomore year. She was also the country's top scoring freshman in her first year of collegiate competition.Stiles has scored 20 or more points in college games 86 times, 30-plus points 35 times, 40-plus points 10 times and in two games she broke the 50 point mark. She is one of only two players in NCAA woman's basketball history to break the 50 point mark twice.Stiles broke the 12 year old NCAA Division I career scoring mark of 3,103 points during a contest at Southwest Missouri State University when her Lady Bears squad beat Creighton University Thursday night. Needing only 20 points to eclipse the old mark set by Mississippi Valley State's Patricia Haskins, Stiles finished the Creighton game by netting 30 in laying claim to the title of ``Women's Collegiate Basketball Scoring Champ.'' The SMSU Lady Bears squad has one more conference game and perhaps as many as three tournament games left in their season that will allow Stiles to raise the new bar even higher.The accomplishments of Jackie Stiles have been noticed by fans, other players and coaches who typically have guarded her with two and sometimes three defenders. She is the first player in the history of the Missouri Valley Conference to earn back-to-back ``Player of the Year'' honors and the first sophomore to earn that title. She has made the first team All-Missouri Valley Conference in each of her first three years on the court at SMSU.Jackie Stiles grew up playing basketball in Claflin, Kansas where she was highly recruited by colleges and universities nationwide as a perimeter shooting guard. Today, her 58 percent field goal percentage ranks among the 20 best in the nation.Jackie Stiles is an All American both on the court and off. She is as good a student as an athlete. Majoring in physical education, Stiles has maintained a sparkling 3.45 grade point average into her senior year and has been named to the Missouri Valley Conference Scholar-Athlete first team every year in her career.Stiles has become an icon on the basketball court in Springfield, Missouri. She is a role model for younger women who would like to follow the good-student, good-athlete trail she is blazing. She is a key reason that while some women's basketball games around the country draw crowds numbered in the hundreds, the Lady Bears' games often draw larger crowds than the men at Southwest Missouri State University. Thursday night's game at Hammons Student Center at SMSU drew the second biggest crowd in school history with more than 9,100 fans there to witness history. Fans in Southwest Missouri believe Jackie Stiles stands a lot taller than her 5 foot, 8 inch frame.I'd like to wish Jackie Stiles and her teammates continued good shooting in their pursuit of a crown in the Missouri Valley Conference and in the women's NCAA tournament later this month.,2015-03-17 19:11:37.906790,2015-03-17 19:11:37.906790,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO JACKIE STILES,2001-03-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-13/html/CREC-2001-03-13-pt1-PgE346-4.htm,33,0,147,E346-E347,B000575,mr. blunt
2884,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to consider voting against this budget resolution and to support the Democratic budget because I think it is a better budget.When one does a budget, one makes choices. One makes choices between size of tax cuts, how much is going to go to pay down the debt, how much goes to Medicare, prescription medicine, how much goes for education, how much goes to support the environment.I suggest to Members that we are making a mistake with this budget. Let us think of it as two products. First, we have the Republican budget product. It is a $2 trillion-plus tax cut, most of which goes to the wealthiest Americans. If we buy this budget, this is what is contained in this plan, this program.On the other hand, if my colleagues vote for a Democratic budget, they get much more. It is a better product. We get lower interest rates. Yes, we get a tax cut focused on middle-income Americans, but we also get debt-free by the year 2008.We get a prescription-drug benefit for all senior citizens. It extends Social Security to 2050, Medicare to 2040. It extends both about 12 years. More quality teachers and more cops on the beat.So the question is which box do we want for the American people. I suggest that this is a decision that will be with us for a long time.I was here in 1981. We had a new President who came saying that he wanted a budget that included a large tax cut. We came to this floor in 1981 and debated that budget. The President said that it would not cause large deficits, that it would create jobs, that it would bring down interest rates and inflation.After we lost our alternative to that tax bill, many of us sat on the floor and wondered what we would do, how we would vote.I was getting calls from home, people saying give the new President a chance; and I did. I voted for the Reagan tax cut. Then the deficits began, as we worried they would. First it was $100 billion a year, then $200 billion, then $300 billion, then almost $400 billion. We went from $1 trillion in back debt to this country to almost $6 trillion in debt.It took the budget summit of 1990 and the Budget Act of 1993 and 1997 to begin to get that deficit under control. Now, instead of having deficits as far as the eye can see, we have surpluses for the first time in 20 years. Why? I ask my friends in this Congress, why would we want to go back and repeat that mistake again?When I went home these last weeks, constituents came up and said where is the Medicare prescription drug program that I thought was going to be coming after the election? Where is the furthering of the solvency of Medicare and Social Security? Where are the smaller classrooms with better teachers and more classroom sizes? These are the issues that people are deciding in this budget debate.I plead with Members, turn down this budget and let us do a budget that does not send this country back into bankruptcy, back into high deficits, back into high interest rates, back into high inflation. We still have time to avoid it.I urge Members to vote against this misguided wrong-headed budget.,2015-03-17 19:11:38.172978,2015-03-17 19:11:38.172978,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2002,2001-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-28/html/CREC-2001-03-28-pt1-PgH1202.htm,43,292,147,H1202-H1271,G000132,mr. gephardt
2885,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Madam President, we will have many important debates over the coming year on this Senate floor. Debates about tax cuts, spending priorities, education and defense, health care and agriculture. But none of these debates will be more important to the future of our democratic process than the debate over campaign finance reform.From the time I sat at our kitchen table balancing the books on my husband's earliest campaign to his race for the U.S. Senate, I have witnessed the changing face of campaigns.Last year's U.S. Senate race in Missouri shattered all previous records. The two opposing campaigns spent almost $18 million. This figure does not include spending by the state parties or outside interest groups.For $18 million, Missouri could have done any one of the following:built two new elementary schools;hired 500 new teachers;sent 3800 students to the University of Missouri;provided day care to an additional 5000 low-income children;put 9,000 new computers into our schools.There is no accounting of the hours and effort that went into raising these large sums of money. It is time and energy I am sure all Senators would rather spend discussing the issues and dealing with problems affecting their constituents.The traditional face-to-face visits with voters at the State fair, the local diner or a town hall play a much smaller role in modern political campaigns. Instead, candidates introduce themselves with costly and skillfully packaged commercials.According to a recent study, viewers in the Kansas City area were exposed to over 22,000 campaign commercials during the 2000 election cycle. At 30 seconds apiece, that is the equivalent of 187 straight hours of campaign ads. The same study showed that the number of ads nationwide has nearly tripled since 1998. Without reform, there is no end in sight.Not only do candidates air ads to get their own message out, they must also respond to negative attacks. More and more, our political discourse is turning away from an honest discussion of the issues affecting the average American. Personal attacks and outrageous distortions are all too common.What are the consequences?Today, Americans are more cynical and more disconnected from the government than ever. They read of huge contributions from special interest groups and wonder how one small voice can possibly be heard over the shouts of large donors to political campaigns.Election day for them is not a celebration of self-government, but a finale to months of nasty, negative messages that have invaded their homes and mailboxes.To rejuvenate our democracy, we must change the common perception and reality that our political system is dominated by big money. To wean American politics from these excesses will be costly and painful, but we must begin.While many reforms are necessary, purging the system of unlimited donations to campaigns through so called ``soft money'' is a necessary first step.Some would argue that passing McCain-Feingold will hurt the Democratic Party, but I say if we do not pass McCain-Feingold, we will be hurting the democratic process.This is a time when all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, must do what is right for our country, what is right for our democracy.The Biblical account of Joshua and the battle of Jericho shows us the strength of a united voice. We are told that ``the people shouted with a great shout, so that the walls fell down.''If we speak with one voice, the wall of ``soft money'' that separates ordinary citizens from their government will come down. Only then can we be confident that campaigns are decided by the power of our ideas, not by the power of our pocketbooks.I enthusiastically support campaign finance reform and hope that we can pass legislation that reduces the influence of money in politics.,2015-03-17 19:11:38.443171,2015-03-17 19:11:38.443171,Senate,CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM,2001-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-28/html/CREC-2001-03-28-pt1-PgS3021.htm,43,0,147,S3021-S3022,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2886,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Madam President, this month we celebrate Women's History Month. It is an opportunity to reflect on the successes, advances and contributions women have made and are making in American life.Today, I have the special privilege of honoring a woman who is not only celebrating women's history this month--she is making it.Jackie Stiles stands 5 feet 8 inches tall, but she is a giant on and off the court. Earlier this week, she led the Lady Bears of Southwest Missouri State into victory over Washington, securing her team a spot in the NCAA Final Four. It was the latest accomplishment in the life of this remarkable young woman.In high school, she was a 14-time state track champion and once scored 71 points in a single basketball game. Her fans would show up at nine in the morning with lounge chairs to be first in line when the gym doors opened at 4:30. They just wanted to catch a glimpse of Jackie in action. She is a hero in her home town--and in towns across America where young girls dream impossible dreams. Jackie shows them dreams can happen.At Southwest Missouri State, Jackie Stiles has scored--as of today--3,361 points, becoming the all-time leading scorer in the NCAA. She has also become the heart of the Lady Bears. Every time she plays, she thrills the sell out crowds at the Hammons Student Center--better known as the ``House of Stiles.''On Friday, the team will come home to Missouri for the Final Four. And with all due respect to my colleagues from the great state of Indiana, I predict a big win over Purdue for Jackie Stiles and the Lady Bears.Jackie Stiles didn't become a star overnight. She does it the hard way--the only way she knows how. She began training at age two with her father and has pushed herself ever since. She goes to the gym and won't leave until she makes 1,000 shots.The story of Jackie Stiles is also the story of Title IX, the landmark civil rights legislation which set out to curtail discrimination against women and girls in education and athletics. Without Title IX, we might never have heard of heroes like Jackie Stiles. In 1971, the year before Title IX, only 25,000 women competed in college sports. Today, that figure has grown to more than 135,000 women--including one very talented player who wears the number ten jersey for Southwest Missouri State.Jackie's success is measured in more than just rebounds, lay-ups, and jump shots. She has brought attention to women's sports, and has proven that women's basketball is exciting. Most of all, she is a role model and an inspiration for thousands of girls.If she chooses, Jackie's next stop is probably the WNBA. I have no doubt that she will become one of the league's greatest attractions. She will help not only her team but her sport and all those who appreciate and enjoy it.Mr. President, in honor of Women's History Month, I'd like to offer my congratulations to Jackie Stiles, the Lady Bears of Southwest Missouri State, and all the other heroes who are bringing women's sports to a new high and teaching young girls to follow their dreams. May they continue to thrill, entertain, and inspire us.,2015-03-17 19:11:38.665328,2015-03-17 19:11:38.665328,Senate,WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH AND JACKIE STILES,2001-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-28/html/CREC-2001-03-28-pt1-PgS3022.htm,43,0,147,S3022,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2887,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote against the Hyde amendment and for international family planning assistance that we know makes a difference in the lives of women and children across the globe.Our international family planning assistance should not be encumbered. It should be enhanced. Overpopulation leads to the suffering of women and children, poverty and environmental degradation. Family planning is critical for the survival of the planet and the people on it, and it plays a critical part in preventing the spread of diseases like HIV/AIDS, which I believe is the moral issue of our time.In one of his first official actions, President Bush decided to restore the so-called Mexico City policy and reinstate controversial restrictions on U.S. family planning assistance. The President said he wanted to make sure U.S. taxpayer dollars were not being spent on abortions abroad. Respectfully, I believe this is a misunderstanding of our law. Since 1973, U.S. policy has prohibited taxpayer funds from being used in any way, shape, or form to provide abortions. But under the Mexico City policy, nongovernmental organizations, with their own funds, cannot inform women about their options, nor can they advocate their own government's laws regarding reproduction. I believe these Presidential restrictions are harmful and will reduce the availability of family planning services to some of the world's poorest and most needy women.There is talk about compassion. In my view, this is not compassionate. In fact, these restrictions placed on overseas family planning organizations would be illegal in our own country. We are imposing restrictions on free speech, putting on a gag order that would not be allowed in the United States of America. We are asking nongovernmental organizations in other places, in other countries, to live under a restriction that we would not impose here in the United States.So the issue is simple. Do we empower women and families across the globe with the ability to plan for the number of children they will have, as is the case here in America? Or do we pull the rug out from under these important efforts? For me, the choice is clear. We must continue to work to empower women with the ability to make their choice necessary to plan the size of their own family.I was in Cambodia recently and we visited a family planning clinic. There were no abortions going on. There was no effort at abortion. They were simply giving women needed advice and education and help with what they desperately wanted, which was family planning. I could not see that without coming to the floor here today to try to change this policy. I think it is the right thing to do morally. I think it is the right thing to do for our leadership role in the world. I ask Members to examine their conscience and to examine the facts. If they will do that, I believe a majority here today will vote to overrule the President's ill-advised order on international family planning.,2015-03-17 19:11:38.887487,2015-03-17 19:11:38.887487,House,FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2002 AND 2003,2001-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-16/html/CREC-2001-05-16-pt1-PgH2189-3.htm,67,29,147,H2189-H2203,G000132,mr. gephardt
2888,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to speak on the upcoming retirement of Lieutenant General Daniel W. Christman, Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. In the very near future, General Christman will retire after over 30 years in the Army. He has distinguished himself, the Army and our nation with dedicated service.General Christman began his service in the military in 1965, after graduating first in his class from the United States Military Academy. Throughout his career General Christman has continued his formal education. He received masters degrees in both civil engineering and public affairs from Princeton University and a law degree from George Washington University.General Christman has held many command assignments and honorably served the American people throughout the world. He served as United States Representative to the NATO Military Committee. He served as Commander of the Savannah District, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Commander of the 54 Engineer Battalion, Company Commander in the 326th Engineer Battalion and Company Commander, 2nd Engineer Battalion.General Christman also served as Staff Officer in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Department of the Army and as a Staff Assistant with National Security Council. In both of these positions General Christman was responsible for advising the Army Chief of Staff and senior staff on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.Prior to his current assignment, General Christman served for nearly two years as Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili. He served for a year and a half as Army advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J. Crowe and as Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States for National Security Affairs.General Christman also served as Director of Strategy, Plans and Policy in Department of Army Headquarters. During this duty he briefed former President Bush, allied heads of state and the NATO Secretary General. He has also testified before Congress on numerous issues, including Conventional Forces in Europe, our NATO commitments and Army force structure.Most notably, I personally got to know Dan Christman during his time as Commanding General, United States Army Engineer Center and Fort Leonard Wood and Commandant, United States Army Engineer Schook, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. During that time, I witnessed Dan as a remarkably talented military leader at the base and in the surrounding communities. His contributions to Fort Leonard Wood will truly be one of the many positive legacies he leaves to the Army.Mr. Speaker, General Christman has had an impressive career in the military and established a great relationship among the civilian community.

2889,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Kansas City, Missouri's most successful childcare facilities. Serving more than 400 children daily, Operation Breakthrough is Missouri's largest single site childcare center and broad based social service agency. This year, Operation Breakthrough will celebrate 30 years of helping less fortunate children develop to their fullest potential.After working together at St. Vincent's Elementary School in 1967, Sister Corita Bussanmas and Sister Berta Sailer were approached by several economically disadvantaged working mothers that wanted affordable and quality childcare. In 1971, at the mothers request the sisters opened a childcare center in their living room, at 31st and Paseo to care for 50 children. Later that year, the Catholic Diocese closed St. Vincent's Parish. Without funds from the Diocese, the parents worked together to obtain Model Cities funding in addition to a grant from the Hall Family Foundation. Thanks to the hard work, long hours and dedication from the sisters, families, volunteers and the community, Operation Breakthrough has gone through many transformations to become the non-religious, 501 &lt;Copyright&gt; (3) not-for-profit corporation that we know today.In 1976, the center grew to include before and after school programs allowing parents the ability to enter and remain in the workforce. Five years later, Operation Breakthrough moved to its current location at 31st and Troost continuing its commitment to the urban core where it has added an extensive assortment of social services to meet the needs of the families and their children.Over the past 30 years, Operation Breakthrough has assisted numerous children living in poverty by providing them a caring and positive learning environmental. This not-for-profit organization offers the families and children of Kansas City the services of day care, Early Start and Head Start programs, a 7,000-volume library, a children's computer lab, health and dental services through Children's Mercy Hospital and various dental clinics, speech therapy, play therapy, occupational therapy, housing assistance, GED tutoring, parenting classes, mentoring, a clothing closet, and nutritious meals.As the largest childcare provider in the state of Missouri, Operation Breakthrough has excelled in every aspect of its service to our community. As a direct result from the success Operation Breakthrough has shown, last years appropriation committee recognized their efforts by funding the Second Step anti-violence program and Child Abuse prevention program in the sum of $180,000.Today, Operation Breakthrough is a place of laughter and joy for children in need.

2890,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, in the past few weeks, I have often thought of that scene in one of Shakespeare's plays where two friends meet, but one does not recognize the other. One explains: ``Grief hath changed me since you saw me last.'' Yes, grief has changed the face of America. We are tear stained by tragedy, but we are triumphant in spirit.It has been nearly 60 years since we experienced such a lethal and cowardly attack on our Nation. Though I was a young child at the time, I still remember the shock and sadness of Pearl Harbor. But I also recall the spirit of unity and partiotism that swelled up within us following that attack.At a time when half of our Navy lay at the bottom of the ocean, President Roosevelt spoke of our ``inevitable triumph.'' He placed his confidence in what he called ``the unbounding determination of the American people.''We all pulled together in the years that followed. We conquered fascism and communism, we rescued democracy, and we built a better world. America's veterans led the way.Today, our President has called us to a similar resolve. And we will answer that call again. We must start by making a new commitment to all those who serve today, and to every one of America's veterans.I have proposed legislation that would extend Tri-Care benefits to our citizens soldiers for up to four months after they return from active duty. It has passed the Senate, and I am working to make sure it becomes part of the Defense bill.I also support a bill to provide Tri-Care for life to every American veteran, because I think we owe them that much.I believe we should extend the Montgomery G.I. bill, and allow veterans to transfer half of their education benefits to their family.I also support the President's efforts to improve the Veterans' Administration's response to benefit claims. It is shameful that someone who risked their life for our country should have to wait for months, even years, to get the benefits they deserve, the benefits they have earned. There might be those who say we can't afford to care for our Nation's veterans, that the price is too high. But I say, if we don't stand by those who fought for us, we are unworthy of their sacrifice.So on the Veteran's Day 2001, a day of remembrance and commitment, we salute the fighting men and women of our Nation, active duty, reserves, and veterans.We look to them in our time of national need. They have never let us down. We pledge our support in the defense of freedom. We declare to them, we declare to each other, we will not allow the American dream to be diminished by fear, or our eyes dimmed by tears.From the ashes of terrorism, we will build a new tower to freedom that will cast its light around the world. With God's help, we will prove again what the poet Carl Sandburg once said: ``We are Americans. Nothing like us ever was.'',2015-03-17 19:11:39.520937,2015-03-17 19:11:39.520937,Senate,A NEW COMMITMENT TO AMERICA'S VETERANS,2001-11-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-11-09/html/CREC-2001-11-09-pt1-PgS11654.htm,155,0,147,S11654-S11655,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2891,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, this week marks the official rebirth of the Congressional Rural Caucus. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to recognize the efforts of Representatives Eva Clayton of North Carolina, Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota to re-establish this important Caucus, and to thank the dozens of organizations and associations which have helped during the planning process and will continue to work with the Congressional Rural Caucus in the days ahead.I am very excited to be a member of this new caucus. A number of years ago, I served a term as Chairman of the previously organized Congressional Rural Caucus. That group was extraordinarily valuable as an outlet for Members representing rural districts to discuss issues and work together to communicate the particular needs and concerns of rural America to the Congress as a whole. After several years of inactivity, I am glad that like-minded Members will once again have a bi-partisan organization that focuses on bringing the priorities of rural America to the forefront in the Congress.In addition to recognizing the new membership of the Congressional Rural Caucus, I would like to say just a few words about one of the groups that has recently assisted with the organization of the Caucus and has for decades worked to improve life in rural America--the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA).One of our nation's greatest achievements during the last century was the electrification of rural America. Before the third decade of the 20th Century, only about 10 percent of America's rural population enjoyed the benefits of electricity. The rest chopped wood, pumped water by hand or carried it from a stream, washed and rinsed the laundry in tubs in the yard. Life without electricity was especially hard on women. They aged early and died young because of the hardships of rural living.Rural electrification provides us with a wonderful example of American ingenuity and federal cooperation. The people of rural America who needed electric service came together as cooperatives to organize and run their own electric utilities, and the government provided loans that most bankers, then or today, could not have provided prudently.Electricity--and the Rural Electrification Administration and the vision of Congress--made a huge difference. Today, more than 99 percent of rural Americans can watch television in the comfort of an all-electric home, can enjoy the efficiencies of all manner of appliances--from toasters to air-conditioners, from grain dryers to milking machines and refrigeration.Because now most rural Americans have electric service, some would say the job is done. I would say the job is just begun. Rural America today faces a different set of challenges. Electric cooperatives have deep roots in their communities, and they have a stake in improving the quality of life, the economics, the health and education of their communities. Electric cooperatives have traditionally provided services well beyond basic electricity, from something as simple as lighting the little league field to something as complex as providing distance learning in rural schools, Internet access, water and sewer, satellite television, economic and community development. They could do more; they would do more. We need to consider how rural Americans across the country could benefit by harnessing the talent of rural electric cooperatives in new ways in this new century.I look forward in the coming months and years, as a member of the Congressional Rural Caucus, to addressing our new rural challenges. Again, I would like to thank the co-chairs of the Caucus and all of the organizations that have worked to bring the Congressional Rural Caucus back to life. Together I think we can be a positive force to bring true and consistent prosperity and a high quality of life to rural Americans.,2015-03-17 19:11:39.643023,2015-03-17 19:11:39.643023,Extensions,RECOGNIZING THE FORMATION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL RURAL CAUCUS,2000-03-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-14/html/CREC-2000-03-14-pt1-PgE306-3.htm,28,0,146,E306,S000465,mr. skelton
2892,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of extraordinary women of the 20th Century. Throughout our history women artists such as Missouri author, Laura Ingalls Wilder, have brought about needed social change in our state and nation. Today, I honor a recording artist From Kennett, Missouri who has maintained strong ties to our state. Sheryl Crow joins a list of Missouri women who have contributed to an extraordinary century of women.Ms. Crow's parents were big band musicians who encouraged her musical skills at an early age. She began playing the piano around the age of six and composed her first song at age 13. In the 1990's, Sheryl Crow forcefully expressed her thoughts and emotions on social causes such as youth violence, addressed in her platinum album lyrics', ``Watch out sister, Watch out brother/Watch our children as they kill each other/With a gun they brought at the Wal-Mart discount stores'' in her ongoing battle with the discount giant over guns and children. In retribution, Wal-Mart refused to sell her award winning records. A Florida State Supreme Court eventually ruled against Wal-Mart for illegally selling ammunition to minors who used the bullets to kill a Pensacola man.Ms. Crow's music encompasses her personal experience and her passionately held beliefs to electrify audiences. Inspired by the likes of Walt Whitman and Bob Dylan. Sheryl Crow has influenced a generation of women to artistry and activism. Her ability to span generations and musical tastes has led Ms. Crow to be one of the most sought after musicians of our time. Her reputation for taking risks is demonstrated by her professional and personal courage to make mistakes and to achieve success. Her song, ``My Favorite Mistake,'' reminds us that we must all have the courage to take risks in order to create something worthwhile.In 1994 Sheryl Crow won Gammy Awards for Best New Artist, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her hit ``All I Wanna Do.'' Two years later, the singer/songwriter won Grammys for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the song, ``If It Makes You Happy.'' Her 1998 double platinum album, ``The Globe Sessions'' was named Best Rock Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards. Her latest effort, ``Sweet Child O' Mine,'' received the 2000 Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Her peers in the music industry and her many dedicated fans have recognized Ms. Crow as a gifted musician and a woman empowered to inspire others.Sheryl Crow cares passionately about eliminating the use of land mines, as demonstrated by here recent efforts in Southeast Asia on behalf of the victims of such weapons of war. The artist has journeyed to Capitol Hill in support of debt relief for the world's most impoverished nations. Ms. Crow has been an outspoken advocate of women's rights and has highlighted her concerns about youth violence issues in songs such as ``Love is a Good Thing.'' I share her belief that one of the most effective ways of reducing youth violence in our culture is to support arts education in schools.I salute Sheryl Crow for being an inspiration as an artist and advocate. Her efforts to make the world a better place will continue to contribute to a better future in the new millennium. ``For all you wanna do,'' Sheryl Crow, Missouri women thank you for your artistry, advocacy, your commitment to the Campaign for a Landmine Free World and a better life for our children.,2015-03-17 19:11:39.888199,2015-03-17 19:11:39.888199,Extensions,HONORING 20TH CENTURY WOMEN,2000-03-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-22/html/CREC-2000-03-22-pt1-PgE390-4.htm,33,0,146,E390-E391,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2893,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, judging from comments by the campaign of Governor Bush, this Republican budget abandons conservatives. If we take a close look at the details of this budget, it is clear that this budget also abandons middle-class families. In their haste to embrace massive fiscally irresponsible tax cuts, Republicans are abandoning Social Security, Medicare, and fiscal responsibility.Despite their talk about how much they care about seniors, the Republican budget does nothing to strengthen the retirement security for current and future retirees.This Republican budget does nothing to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare. It does not provide one dime to strengthen the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. They ignore the looming shortfall that threatens the future retirement security of all Americans.The Republican budget fails to propose a Medicare prescription drug benefit to cover all seniors. The cost of prescription drugs is hurting all seniors. This is not a problem which is just limited to low-income retirees.The Republican budget does not help middle-class seniors. Their budget says that they need to be spending themselves into poverty with prescription drug costs before they get Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.To make matters worse, I understand at 3:00 a.m. in the morning, the funding that was in their budget to support a Patients' Bill of Rights was taken out. So I suppose that priority will also be lost.The Republican budget abandons the fiscal responsibility that we worked so hard to achieve and tries to turn back the clock to the early 1990s. They threaten the balanced budget and efforts to pay off the debt by the year 2013.The analysis by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on the Budget found that the Republicans would spend some of the Social Security surplus by 2004 and as a result we would be revisited by on-budget deficits if we enact this budget once again.The Republican budget proposes deep cuts in investments in education, health, and veterans affairs, putting our children and others even further behind.One may ask, why this abandonment? The Republican budget sacrifices fiscal responsibility on the altar of massive tax cuts. The Republican budget proposes $150 billion in tax cuts now, $50 billion after the smoke clears, and then possibly another $50 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy and special interests if revenues increase.The American people rejected these massive tax cuts that threaten our economic progress and retirement security last year, in last year's budget debate. Clearly, Republicans still have not gotten the message. The American people want a budget plan that pays off the debt, extends the life of Social Security and Medicare, provides a prescription drug plan for all seniors, and addresses our pressing health and educational priorities.So this is not the right budget. We need to vote against the rule and vote against this budget. Let us reject this budget and protect the surplus for the priorities of working families.I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget and for our alternative that puts families first and keeps our fiscal house in order.,2015-03-17 19:11:40.131369,2015-03-17 19:11:40.131369,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-23/html/CREC-2000-03-23-pt1-PgH1291-2.htm,34,9,146,H1291-H1326,G000132,mr. gephardt
2894,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us is a responsible budget framework. Senator Domenici has done a superb job in helping to craft this budget on the Senate side, and he deserves our praise. This budget resolution balances the important goals of debt reduction, tax relief, and prudent spending levels.Most importantly, the budget will fully protect Social Security now and in the future. This represents a sea change in the way business is done in Washington. When I came to Washington, Congress routinely spent money out of the Social Security trust fund. This resolution ends the raid on Social Security, and does so in two ways.First, the budget is based on the premise that Social Security funds will not be used to pay for additional deficit spending or tax relief. Second, as part of this budget's commitment to protect the entire Social Security surplus, Senator Domenici included a point of order against any budget that spends money out of the Social Security surplus. This rule is the same as the one I proposed last year, and that was included in the FY 2000 budget.As a result of this hard-fought fiscal discipline, this budget will retire $1.1 trillion in publicly held debt over 5 years, and approximately $170 billion next year. If we continue upon the path laid out by this budget, we will completely eliminate the publicly-held debt over the next 13 years.We have already made great progress in this regard. When this budget is enacted, we will have reduced the national debt by $533 billion over the past three years.I was particularly pleased that the Senate unanimously accepted my amendment objecting to the President's plan to have the government invest Social Security surpluses in the stock market. This risky scheme would have put both Social Security and the stock market at risk.In addition to responsibly paying off our publicly-held debt, this budget allows for approximately $150 billion in tax relief over 5 years, including $13 billion in FY 2001. These actions include significant marriage penalty relief, which already has passed the House, and is working its way through the Senate. In fact, during the debate on the Budget Resolution, the Senate passed the Hutchison-Ashcroft amendment calling for marriage penalty relief 99-1.In addition to providing a judicious mix of tax relief, debt reduction, and Social Security protection, the FY 2001 Budget Resolution also includes responsible spending levels. This budget, which is a balanced budget for the third year in a row, calls for approximately $600.5 billion in discretionary spending.This budget will fully fund Medicare, rejecting President Clinton's Medicare cuts of $14 billion over 5 years. In addition, Congress' spending plan calls for a $40 billion reserve fund to pay for Medicare reform and Medicare prescription drugs.As I said, this budget focuses spending towards our national priorities, including a $4.5 billion increase in education spending in FY 2001, and $5.5 billion in agriculture spending in FY 2000. The FY 2001 budget also increases funding for domestic priorities such as Head Start; embassy security; the National Science Foundation; the National Institutes of Health; the Park Service; and highways and airports.Of course, this budget isn't perfect. I was disappointed that the Senate did not adopt the effort to protect the Medicare surplus with my Medicare lockbox amendment. This amendment, which would have extended the protections that now apply to Social Security to the Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance trust, did not overcome a point of order in the Senate.Despite this setback, I am pleased with the overall package agreed to by Congress. It meets the vital national needs of protecting Social Security, reducing debt, cutting taxes, and funding our domestic priorities. I plan to vote for the FY 2001 Budget Resolution.,2015-03-17 19:11:40.288477,2015-03-17 19:11:40.288477,Senate,FISCAL YEAR 2001 BUDGET--CONFERENCE REPORT,2000-04-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-04-13/html/CREC-2000-04-13-pt1-PgS2674-2.htm,47,52,146,S2674-S2696,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2895,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, today I honor National D.O. Day. I rise to recognize members of the osteopathic medical profession for their substantial contributions to American healthcare. I congratulate the American Osteopathic Association on its 103 years of service to osteopathic physicians and their patients. It is my pleasure to acknowledge members of the osteopathic medical profession, their spouses, and osteopathic medical students who have chosen today to make visits to their representatives and senators. It's good to see these individuals taking time to educate our colleagues on the values and principles of osteopathic medicine.Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate to represent the State of Missouri, which is the home of osteopathic medicine. In 1892, a charter was obtained for the American School of Osteopathy. The original school was located in a small one room building in Kirksville, Missouri and today is known as the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine. A revised and expanded charter was issued on October 3, 1894, in accordance with the laws regulating educational institutions in the State of Missouri. Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, an allopathic physician (or M.D.), was the founder of the Kirksville school and, indeed, the father of osteopathic medicine.Osteopathic medicine is a unique form of American medical care developed in 1874 by Dr. Still who was dissatisfied with the effectiveness of 19th century medicine. Dr. Still was one of the first in his time to study the attributes of good health so that he could understand the process of disease. Dr. Still's philosophy focused on the unity of all body parts. He identified the musculoskeletal system as a key element of health and recognized the body's ability to heal itself. Dr. Still pioneered the concept of ``wellness'' over 100 years ago. He stressed preventative medicine, eating properly and keeping fit. Dr. Still's philosophy--that in coordination with appropriate medical treatment--the osteopathic physician acts as a teacher to help patients take more responsibility for their own well-being and change unhealthy patterns--is every bit as viable today as it was when he developed it.D.O.s complete four years of basic medical education, followed by an intern year and specialty training. In fact, D.O.s are certified in 23 specialties and subspecialties. They pass state licensing examinations and practice in duly accredited and licensed osteopathic and allopathic healthcare facilities. D.O.s comprise a separate, yet equal, branch of American medical care.It is the ways that D.O.s and M.D.s are different that brings an extra dimension to healthcare. Just as Dr. Still pioneered osteopathic medicine on the Missouri frontier in 1874, today's osteopathic physicians serve as modern day medical pioneers. They continue the tradition to bringing healthcare to areas of greatest need. Approximately 64 percent of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care areas such as pediatrics, family practice, obstetrics/gynecology and internal medicine. Many D.O.s fill a critical need by practicing in rural and medically underserved areas.To the over 1,600 D.O.s in my state, the approximately 2,000 students at Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine in Kirksville and Kansas City, and to all 45,000 D.O.s represented by the American Osteopathic Association--congratulations on your contributions to the good health of the American people. I look forward to working with you to further our mutual goal of continually improving our nation's healthcare.,2015-03-17 19:11:40.522643,2015-03-17 19:11:40.522643,Extensions,APRIL 13, 2000 IS NATIONAL D.O.

2896,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the Small Business Relief Act of 2000. This bill will provide a lifeline for the thousands of small business owners threatened by lawsuits and litigation under the broken Superfund liability system.This bill is simple. All this bill does is relieve innocent small business owners from superfund liability unless it is demonstrated that the small business is guilty of gross negligence or did contribute significantly to the toxic waste at the superfund site.My bill will not let polluters off the hook. This common-sense proposal will make the Superfund program a little more reasonable and workable. With this legislation, we can begin to provide some relief to small business owners who are held hostage by potential Superfund liability.For years now, members from both sides of the aisle have said that the Superfund program is broken, it doesn't work, it must be reformed. Unfortunately we haven't gotten past the rhetoric to fix the problem. Instead of making changes that will produce results that are better for the taxpayers, better for the environment, and more efficient for everyone involved--government agencies, federal bureaucrats, and Congress has protected this troubled and inefficient program from meaningful reform.As Washington has played politics with the Superfund program, innocent Main Street small business owners across the nation, the engine of our economy, continue to be unfairly pulled into Superfund's legal quagmire. Even the EPA has stated its support for protecting restaurant owners, mom-and-pop convenience store operators, and other small business owners who have legally disposed of their trash and cannot afford the tab that comes with Superfund legal bills.Let's put a human face on this: last year, just across the Missouri border--in Quincy, Illinois--160 small business owners were asked to pay the EPA more than $3 million for garbage legally hauled to a dump more than 20 years ago. The situation in Quincy is just one example of the very real, ongoing Superfund legal threat to small business owners across the nation.Mr. President, we all know that Superfund was created to clean up the nation's most-hazardous waste sites. Superfund was not created to have small business owners sued for simply throwing out their trash! These small business owners are faced with so many challenges already, that the thousands of dollars in penalties and lawsuits leave them with no choice but to mortgage their businesses, their employees and their future to pay for the bills of a broken government program.How many times will we tell ourselves that this unacceptable situation must be fixed before we act? Small business owners literally cannot afford to wait around while we delay action on the common-sense fixes required to protect them and our environment.

2897,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote no on this rule and if it does pass, to vote no on this bill. Everyone in America knows that the most important issue in front of us is education and training children, the way we raise children. Go into any business in America today and they will tell you they need trained people. They do not have enough trained people to fill the jobs. We constantly are asked by businesspeople for legitimate reasons to open up immigration rolls to bring in trained people to fill the jobs that Americans are not available to fill today.Every family knows that raising a child today is more difficult in a very busy and different world that we live in. Parents have less time with children by about a third than they did 15 or 20 years ago. This bill walks away from all of those concerns. There is not enough money in it for the teachers that we need to teach our children in elementary and secondary schools across the country. It zeros out the funds that are supposed to be there for the 100,000 teachers that we should be trying to help the local districts with. It provides no funds for the effort to try to repair and rehabilitate and expand school building structures, so we can get smaller class sizes to go with the teachers that are all designed to get smaller class size. It guts the President's proposal to improve teacher quality and insist on teacher recruitment and school accountability.Denying all of this funding is frankly inexcusable and unnecessary. Part of the reason, I guess, that we are not able to put enough money into these efforts is that tomorrow we have a bill to wipe out the estate tax entirely. Everything that we do here is a choice. We have a choice. We can wipe out the estate tax entirely or we can simply modify it and make it more reasonable, thereby not spending as much money on that effort and using those moneys that we do not use on that effort to deal with schools and children and teachers and standards in public schools.We are making a choice this week that we want the top 10 percent of the top 1 percent of Americans to get an incredible tax cut rather than spending the money on our children, on our future, on our ability to keep this economy which is white hot going in the right direction. That is the choice we face today.I urge Members to vote against this rule, to vote against this bill so that we can make the right choice for America's most precious resource which are our children.,2015-03-17 19:11:41.043018,2015-03-17 19:11:41.043018,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4577, DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-06-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-08/html/CREC-2000-06-08-pt1-PgH4044-6.htm,70,12,146,H4044-H4054,G000132,mr. gephardt

APWU is certainly well served to have Mr. Reid representing their Union before the Congress of the United States.,2015-03-17 19:11:41.187120,2015-03-17 19:11:41.187120,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO MYKE REID,2000-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-15/html/CREC-2000-06-15-pt1-PgE1018.htm,75,0,146,E1018,C000488,mr. clay
2899,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) and I thank the chairman for allowing this additional debate to go on.Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Lowey-Greenwood amendment. The inadequate funding and restrictions on our international family planning assistance in this bill should be rejected. And that is only one of the many glaring flaws in this bill that I hope we can correct this afternoon.As we heard so eloquently last night, the funding in this bill for debt relief is clearly inexcusable. With the funding provided in this bill, governments in developing nations will continue to stagger under huge loads of debt. Millions of people in Africa, South America, Central America will be deprived of much needed education, health care and development. These governments will have to repay loans before addressing the fundamental need of their people.Another outrageous shortcoming in this bill is the cut in funding requested to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.People in America, our constituents, are just in many cases beginning to learn of the tragedy of AIDS in Africa and around the world. This is a crisis that has affected us and people around the world for many years now. But in African nations it reaches alarming proportions.I led a delegation that some of my colleagues accompanied me on in December to Nigeria and Zimbabwe and South Africa. It is one thing to intellectualize and theorize about this problem. It is quite another thing to confront dying humanity by the thousands and thousands.Twenty-two million people in Africa are infected with HIV/AIDS. Many, many more thousands are infected each week, each month.This issue, in my opinion, is the moral imperative of our time. How much longer will we go on and say it does not matter, it does not concern me that 22 million people are probably going to die?I can theorize about it. But when I confront it head on, as we did in a village in Zimbabwe where everyone we met was infected with HIV/AIDS, it is a different matter.There has never in the history of the world been a threat to life like this. If an Army were raging through Africa killing millions of people, we would be mounting armies to go to Africa to save lives. We say we are concerned with life.This is the issue of life in our world today. I beg the Members to vote for these amendments, to move our world in the right direction to provide the assistance and the aid that people are crying out for.Finally, I will say we met the head doctor of the largest hospital in Johannesburg. He is a pediatrician. He said that half the children that are born in the hospital right now are infected with HIV/AIDS and will die within the next year; and we cannot even provide, he said, the medication that we know we can provide that costs about $8 to make sure that the children of HIV-infected AIDS patients will be free of AIDS. And it is 70 percent effective. Eight dollars. Eight dollars to make sure that a child who will be born will not die.This is the moral issue of our time. I pray that this House and all of our great Representatives will stand and deliver on the moral issue, the most important moral issue we will ever face. Vote for these amendments.,2015-03-17 19:11:41.432297,2015-03-17 19:11:41.432297,House,FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-07-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-07-13/html/CREC-2000-07-13-pt1-PgH5961-9.htm,90,193,146,H5961-H6025,G000132,mr. gephardt
2900,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) for yielding me the time.Mr. Speaker, I also thank the gentlewoman for her commitment and her efforts to get this important bill to the floor, and I am pleased that my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), has worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor as well.There is no question that in our society in the last generation, too often fathers have been absent without leave. Too often fathers have not been where they were supposed to be, have not been doing what they were supposed to be doing, and rightly and appropriately, because of that, so much of our effort has been to figure out what we could do to help mothers.Well, one thing we can do to help mothers is to try to help create an environment where fathers really function as fathers, where fathers do more than father a child, they actually play the role of fathers in this society. This bill is a significant step in that direction.This bill is a significant effort to try to make that happen. Education, job training, parenthood training are all skills that fathers need. We are changing lots of communities in America, beginning with welfare reform; and people in those many communities begin to see for the first time a community driven by work, not welfare.They also need an opportunity to see a community driven by two-parent families, not single moms struggling to get by. Too many young men in America have grown up in the last decade, maybe even the last 3 decades in communities where there were no role models of fathers, in communities where we do not just pick up the fatherhood parenting skills by watching what happens next door, because what happens next door is exactly what happened at your house, a single mom struggling to get by, nobody to help her with that process.This bill goes beyond adding the important resources that it does add to collecting child support. It goes beyond that and works hard for the first time in a significant way at a Federal level to help fathers become fathers to do that through faith-based organizations and community-based organizations.And as well intentioned as I know the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) will be with his motion to recommit, of course, I am opposed to that, because I think involving these community-based and faith-based organizations, as this bill does, with the appropriate protections already in the law and in this bill, is a way to deliver these services.How do we deliver services that create guidelines, the role models, the thoughts about parenthood and fatherhood, if we immediately exclude from that people who understand the community, people who work in that community and community-based and faith-based organizations all the time.We need to look constantly for better ways to deliver these messages that make our society more of what we want it to be. Fathers working alongside mothers, raising children in an environment driven by work and values and family is what we need to be trying to build our society on. That can happen more effectively with the implementation this bill.I am for it. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. I am grateful to my colleagues who have worked so hard to bring this important piece of legislation to the floor today.,2015-03-17 19:11:41.676469,2015-03-17 19:11:41.676469,House,CHILD SUPPORT DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 2000,2000-09-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-07/html/CREC-2000-09-07-pt1-PgH7297.htm,103,26,146,H7297-H7321,B000575,mr. blunt
2901,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the ending of the marriage penalty, to say that the Democratic alternative did that for people that actually have a marriage penalty, and our problem with this bill is that it extends about 60 percent of its benefits to people that earn above the middle class and have many more means than the middle class and, frankly, do not have a marriage penalty.Our problem with the bill, and the President's problem with the bill, and the reason the bill was vetoed, is that it goes ahead and does a lot of things that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty.We are all for getting rid of the marriage penalty. For about $100 billion over 10 years, we could do that for the people that have a problem. We could be carrying on a discussion today about a bill that the President would sign that would end the marriage penalty, but that is not what was chosen to do. So we are wasting time today, again, working on a bill that has been vetoed that will never see the light of day. I go door to door in my district; I went door to door last weekend and people talked to me about all kinds of issues, prescription medicine and Medicare, a Patients' Bill of Rights, helping public education and trying to get smaller classroom sizes.And they talk about tax relief; but they want tax relief that is affordable, reasonable, feasible, and is targeted at the people that really need it. They do not think we need tax relief for people that earn $130,000, $150,000, $200,000 a year. They earn $30,000 a year or $40,000 a year; and they would like the tax relief limited and targeted at them. They also want us to save the vast majority of the surplus to pay down the debt and to take care of Social Security and Medicare.Now yesterday in a meeting in the White House, the Speaker and other Members of the Republican leadership came in with a new budget, and the new budget is that we are going to save 90 percent of the unified surplus to pay down the debt. Now, there are two problems with this. One, we are back to the unified surplus. I thought we were putting Social Security in a lockbox. If we are exposing the unified surplus to some new goal setting, 90/10, it could mean that in some years we would enter the lockbox and start spending Social Security money.I cannot imagine that we would want to do that.The second thing is, here we are on the floor today spending an hour trying to override a veto on a $300 billion tax cut. If you add up all the tax cuts that the leadership has brought to the floor and passed, you are well above 10 percent of the surplus. So the action today is inconsistent with the theory that was propounded just yesterday. We want to do these bills.I say to my friends on the other side, let us stop the posturing. Let us stop the putting out bills that are not going anywhere. People in your districts and in mine want us to do something now, this year, to end the marriage penalty. We can do the marriage penalty before these next 3 or 4 weeks are up, if we will only target it at the people that actually have a marriage penalty.Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote to sustain this veto. Let us sit down in a spirit of bipartisanship and let us get the job done for the American people.,2015-03-17 19:11:41.935648,2015-03-17 19:11:41.935648,House,MARRIAGE TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2000--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,2000-09-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-13/html/CREC-2000-09-13-pt1-PgH7509-2.htm,107,59,146,H7509-H7519,G000132,mr. gephardt
2902,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.In closing, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments and her leadership on this issue.Mr. Chairman, one of the responsibilities of the Committee on Small Business is to inform the Members of the House when its will regarding opportunity for small business is not being carried out within the Federal agencies; specifically, as we have heard today, most predominantly within the Department of Defense. I appreciated very much the comments of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ortiz), who sits on the Committee on Armed Services with me and sees this constant flouting of our will regarding small business over and over again from that perspective as well. This is not just partisanship for small business. I think that would be appropriate, Mr. Chairman. Not only is small business the backbone of the economy, as Members have said so eloquently today, but it is increasingly the backbone of opportunity.It may be the only source of opportunity for so many people in our country: for single moms, who will not have an opportunity to get a postgraduate education; or for people reentering the workforce after raising kids; or people coming from distressed neighborhoods or disadvantaged backgrounds. They do not have the same kind of opportunities that other people may have, but they can start a small business. And we have had evidences of that and testimonies of that over and over again before the Committee on Small Business.We think the government ought to favor small business. Certainly it ought not to disadvantage them. And that is what is at stake here. This is a question of fairness for our entrepreneurs around the country. We have given numerous examples. We could give more of them, but I do not think it is necessary.This bill simply allows us to find out what is going on. It has a unitary definition of bundling. It establishes a database, instructs the Committee on Small Business to operate that database and tell us what is going on, and then analyze whether any of these contracts actually save money, as they say it will, or produce higher quality, as they say it will. We have not found any evidence of that, and we have looked pretty hard for the last year and a half.So it is up to the Members to decide what they want to do. I am going to get a rollcall vote on this issue, Mr. Chairman. I hope Members do not mind. As the gentlewoman from New York said, one of the reasons for this bill is to send a message, if the House wants to send it, regarding contracting and procurement for small businesses. We just have to decide. Do we want to vote for opportunity for small business people, or convenience or the latest trend in procurement within the Federal bureaucracy? Do we want to vote for continued excuses and evasions when we ask the agencies to justify what they are doing, or do we want to vote to enforce and send a message about the will of this body regarding opportunities for small entrepreneurs around this country?I know how I am going to vote, Mr. Chairman. I suspect that I know how the Members of the House are going to vote.,2015-03-17 19:11:42.100766,2015-03-17 19:11:42.100766,House,SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITION PRESERVATION ACT OF 2000,2000-09-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-20/html/CREC-2000-09-20-pt1-PgH7876-3.htm,112,35,146,H7876-H7885,T000024,mr. talent
2903,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of my good friend Governor Mel Carnahan, of Rolla, Missouri.Governor Carnahan, 66, the fifty-first Governor of the State of Missouri, his son Roger Andrew ``Randy'' Carnahan, and a long-time advisor, Chris Sifford, died in an airplane crash on October 16, 2000, in rural Jefferson County.Born in the small Ozark town of Birch Tree, Missouri, in 1934, Governor Carnahan lived his early years in Shannon and Carter Counties. He was the son of rural schoolteachers, and he carried on a longstanding family commitment to education during his distinguished career of public service. His father, the late A.S.J. Carnahan, a contemporary of President Harry Truman, served in the United States Congress for 14 years before being named by President Kennedy as the first U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone. His mother, the late Mary Carnahan, was an inspiration to hundreds of school children during her many years as a high school English teacher.Governor Carnahan began his lifelong commitment to public service at the young age of 26, when he was elected municipal judge in his hometown of Rolla in 1961. Two years later, he won a seat in the Missouri House of Representatives and was elected Majority Floor Leader in his second term. Following his four years in the Missouri House, he returned to his hometown of Rolla where he built a successful law practice. In 1980, he was overwhelmingly elected State Treasurer and served in this position for four years. The Governor returned to public office in 1988, becoming Missouri's 42nd Lieutenant Governor. In a landslide victory in 1992, he won the Governor's office and Missouri voters returned him to office for a second term in 1996.Governor Carnahan was running for the United States Senate, after two remarkably successful four-year terms as Governor. Among the major accomplishments of his administration were the Outstanding Schools Act, a comprehensive package of reforms, new resources and accountability measures to improve Missouri's public schools; major tax relief for working families; welfare reform; some of the toughest anti-crime laws in the nation; and primary health care services for thousands of previously uninsured Missouri children. Governor Carnahan will forever be remembered as an advocate for children and working families.Governor Carnahan held a Bachelor's Degree in business administration from George Washington University and graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia Law School in 1959 with the highest scholastic honors--Law Review and Order of the Coif. He was a United States Air Force veteran, a 33rd degree Mason, and a longtime member of the First Baptist Church in Rolla. He served as Chairman of both the Southern and Democratic Governors' Association.Mr. Speaker, Mel Carnahan was a good friend and a truly great American. I know the Members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to his family: his wife of 46 years, Jean Carnahan; two sons, Russ and Tom Carnahan; one daughter, Robin Carnahan, of St. Louis; one daughter-in-law, Debra Carnahan; one brother and sister-in-law, Bob and Oma Carnahan, and two grandsons, Austin and Andrew.,2015-03-17 19:11:42.371957,2015-03-17 19:11:42.371957,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF MISSOURI GOVERNOR MEL CARNAHAN,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgE1858-2.htm,132,0,146,E1858,S000465,mr. skelton
2904,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, today I rise with a deep sense of sadness. As you all are aware, on Monday night Missouri's Governor, Mel Carnahan, was killed in a tragic plane crash. Also killed in the crash were the Governor's son, Randy Carnahan, and the Governor's long-time aide, Chris Sifford. My wife Janet and I join with all Missourians in mourning these deaths. We express our deepest sympathies to the Carnahan and Sifford families. We will continue to pray that God will grant these families comfort, healing, and strength in this time of great sorrow. This is a time when the Carnahan and Sifford families must bear the burden of a tragedy so unexpected and so profound that each of usAs the collective heart of Missouri mourns the loss of a leader, this is a time for unity and common purpose in Missouri. We, as both a State and Nation, join together to mourn the loss of Governor Carnahan--a committed public servant. Although we were competing for the same office, Governor Carnahan and I had a unique relationship united by the common bonds of public service and respect for the people of Missouri. We both were honored to be sons of educators. We both loved time spent with our families on our farms.Governor Carnahan and I also shared a commitment to the greatest promise for our Nation's future: the education of our children. We committed to the commonsense idea that to continue our prosperity, we should invest part of the Federal surplus in educating America's children. That is a theme which I will pursue with intensity here in the Senate. Governor Carnahan has always been present and accounted for when duty called. He served as a member of the United States Air Force. He was a municipal judge. As a member of the State House of Representatives, he served as majority flood leader. He was elected State Treasurer in 1980, Lieutenant Governor in 1988, and Governor in 1992. He was highly respected and the State prospered during his time as Governor.As we absorb the blow of this tragedy, we should be reminded of what truly is important in life--commitment to God, to family, and to our fellow citizens. These were the commitments of Mel Carnahan. He served the people of Missouri with dignity and honor for more than four decades. I will remember him, and all of Missouri will remember him, for his dedication to his family--as a husband, a father, and a grandfather. We are all grateful that Mel Carnahan was willing to spend his life serving the people and the State of Missouri. I again extend my deepest sympathies to Governor Carnahan's wife, Jean, and to his family. Our prayers are with them in this time of great loss.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:42.629141,2015-03-17 19:11:42.629141,Senate,REMEMBERING GOVERNOR MEL CARNAHAN,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgS10743-8.htm,132,0,146,S10743-S10744,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2905,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 782, reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA). I'd like to commend Chairman Bill Goodling, Chairman Buck McKeon, Ranking Member Bill Clay, and all the Members of the Education and Workforce Committee for their hard work on this important bill.Mr. Speaker, after a lifetime of hard work, our retirement years should be the best years of our lives. All Americans should be able to look forward to their golden years as a time for new opportunities and to pursue new learning experiences--no matter what challenges aging may present. Most importantly, each of us should be able to enter into our retirement with the confidence and security that come with knowing that we will not be isolated or forgotten by our communities or government.One of the simplest ways to ensure that all of these goals are met is to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. Unlike funding from many other federal government programs that pay for long term care, OAA funds allow seniors to age with dignity and respect. By linking seniors with a variety of existing federal, state, and local home and community based services, seniors now have the ability to remain in their own homes and communities as they grow older. Some of these services include home-delivered and congregate meals, transportation, employment services, chore and personal care, legal assistance, elder abuse protections, nursing home ombudsman, senior employment, adult day care, senior centers, legal assistance and counseling as well as many other unique programs. Even more importantly, this broad array of services is available in just about every community in the nation.One of the most beneficial OAA programs in my district is the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP). This program is the nation's only employment and training program aimed exclusively at low-income older Americans. It serves over 90,000 low-income elderly persons every year, keeping them active and involved in their communities, not isolated at home. It provides them with the opportunity to make important contributions to their communities and to learn new skills, while enhancing their sense of dignity and self-esteem. I am very pleased that this bill allows groups like Greenthumb, just one group that helps to administer the SCESEP, to continue the wonderful job they've been doing in placing seniors in worthwhile employment positions. Greenthumb has been especially important to seniors in hard to reach areas--including rural areas like those in my district, and I am glad that H.R. 782 continues to support Greenthumb's important mission.Our nation's seniors have given a lifetime of service. Reauthorizing the Older Americans Act allows us to give back to the seniors who have made our country what it is today, and I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation.,2015-03-17 19:11:42.872313,2015-03-17 19:11:42.872313,House,OLDER AMERICANS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2000,2000-10-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-24/html/CREC-2000-10-24-pt1-PgH10581-3.htm,134,26,146,H10581-H10606,E000172,mrs. emerson

2907,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to one of our nation's outstanding postal employees, Mr. Douglas C. Holbrook, on the occasion of his retirement. As the former chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, I came to know Douglas Holbrook and to witness his deep commitment and tireless service to all who work for the United States Postal Service.In 1981, Douglas Holbrook was appointed to service as Secretary-Treasurer of the American Postal Workers Union which represents 330,000 postal workers in every city in the United States. He was elected to that office in 1983 and has been reelected in every subsequent national APWU election. Holbrook's fifth term of office will conclude this Fall.Holbrook began his career with the U.S. Postal Service in 1956 as a part-time clerk. He later founded SOAR--Save Our Annuity Retirement--a coalition of 40,000 active and retired federal and postal employees in Michigan. He was also elected Chairman of the APWU Local Presidents' Conference in 1980-81, and went on to serve on numerous national union committees.Before he arrived in Washington, Holbrook was President of the Detroit District Area Local of the American Postal Workers Union and its predecessor, the Detroit Local of the National Postal Union.Douglas Holbrook has also served as a member of the Board of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO. He was elected to the Fitzgerald Board of Education in Warren, Michigan from 1971 to 1980, serving three years as President and two years as Vice President. In 1990 he was appointed by Governor Wilder of Virginia to serve the Department of Children, State of Virginia. He also served on the Board of Directors, Security Bank of Maryland.

2908,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, the greatness of America, in large part, depends on the goodness of its families. The course of our nation is not steered so much by media personalities, or intellectuals, or politicians, as much as it is set by husbands and wives committed to each other, to their children, and to their communities. Dr. Burl and Reba Pfander, of Springfield, Missouri, are such a couple.On September 5th, Burl and Reba will be celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary. When a young World War II veteran married his attractive bride in 1948, they made a life-long commitment to each other. In an age when many people have entered and exited marriages with startling rapidity, Burl and Reba Pfander have kept their promise. They have stood as an example of what marriage should be: a solemn commitment, a life-long partnership, and a relationship of love and honor. As a result, their marriage has enriched their own lives and the lives of their family beyond measure.The commitment of Burl and Reba to family and to the future is reflected in their son, Michael. Michael has become a veterinarian, continuing his father's private practice of thirty-eight years. Michael has gone on to form his own family; he and his wife, Jeanne, are the parents of Burl and Reba's granddaughter, Meghan Michelle. Burl and Reba Pfander have raised a son that any family would be proud of, with the type of values every son should have. The most important obligation of each generation is to pass on a set of values to the next generation. The Pfanders have met that obligation.Outside of their family, Burl and Reba's marriage has benefited an entire community. The Pfanders have been involved with local youth organization for many years. Reba has been named an honorary farmer of the Nixa, Missouri, chapter of the Future Farmers of America. Burl has supported the FFA, 4-H, and the Missouri Junior Polled Hereford Association. Both Pfanders are active members of their local church, and they serve as volunteers for community-wide events.The Pfanders have also shown a strong commitment to giving young people opportunities to advance themselves through higher education. They have endowed an annual scholarship in memory of Reba's brother, Wallace Lanz, who was killed in World War II. The scholarship is given to support local high school seniors as they enter college. Burl and Reba also counsel aspiring veterinarians about their applications to veterinary colleges. Burl and Reba Pfander understand the importance of giving back to their community.Fifty years ago, few people may have recognized the significance of the wedding of Burl Pfander to Reba Lanz, but today few people in their community can escape it. The Pfanders have remained committed to each other; they have been good parents and passed on their values to a son who has followed in his parents' path; they have been model citizens; and they have given of themselves to those around them. I am glad to give my congratulations to Dr. Burl and Reba Pfander on their fiftieth wedding anniversary.,2015-03-17 19:11:43.574818,2015-03-17 19:11:43.574818,Extensions,CELEBRATING THE 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF DR.

2909,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,I,Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to fulfill the pledge I made to the citizens of southern Missouri to introduce and work tirelessly to pass an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that requires a balanced Federal budget. Over the course of the past several decades, fiscal irresponsibility has produced a Federal debt that is fast approaching $5 trillion. That's trillion, with a ``t,'' Mr. Speaker. A debt of $5 trillion is a mind-boggling figure, but it can be placed in a much clearer perspective. A child born today immediately inherits nearly $20,000 of debt, owed directly to Uncle Sam. The same is true for every American. The era of continuing annual budget deficits must end, and it is clear that the only way to restore conservative fiscal values to the Nation's budget is to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.The stakes in this debate could not be more important. The fiscal future of the United States hinges on the ability of Congress and the President to make the difficult choices required to balance the Federal budget. It's more than debating trillion dollar figures. It's about making our economy stronger and providing every working American family with a better chance to make ends meet. A balanced budget will strengthen every sector of our economy with lower interest rates that will help families stretch each paycheck further. Home mortgages, automobiles, and a better education will become more affordable to every working family, making the American Dream closer to reality for all.Mr. Speaker, I am committed to working with my colleagues in the new Congress to see that the balanced budget constitutional amendment is passed and sent to the States for ratification. A constitutional amendment is certainly no substitute for direct action on the part of the Congress. However, we have seen time and time again instances where those who object to conservative fiscal responsibility find convenient excuses to deny the American people a balanced budget. An unbreakable enforcement mechanism is clearly needed to ensure that those who would continue to spend our children's future further into debt are not able to do so.I also want to make plain that the Social Security trust fund has no place in this debate. The independent trust fund is a sacred trust between generations and must never be used to balance the budget or hide the true size of the deficit.Commonsense conservatives in Congress and the American people are committed to balancing the budget. I look forward to working throughout this session with all of my colleagues and the White House to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment on a bipartisan basis. The obligations we owe to hard working American families, their children, and our Nation's future generations deserve nothing less than decisive action to preserve our future by balancing the budget. A constitutional amendment will ensure this outcome.,2015-03-17 19:11:43.838006,2015-03-17 19:11:43.838006,Extensions,A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET,1997-01-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-01-07/html/CREC-1997-01-07-pt1-PgE27-2.htm,1,0,143,E27,E000172,mrs. emerson
2910,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to our former colleague and my dear friend, Charles Hayes--a leader, a visionary and a man of the people. Charlie passed away on April 8, 1997, in Chicago, IL.Charles Hayes was a crusader for justice, fairness, and decency. He began his quest to make the world a better place before most Members of this body were born.Emerging from the fiery furnace of the Great Depression as a member of the Civilian Conservation Corps, he learned the importance of work and fairness early on.At the young age of 20, Charlie stood up against racism and discrimination in the workplace. He organized a group of black carpenters in a flooring plant and formed a local union to secure fairer wages and better working conditions for the employees. He was elected president of that local and began his climb to become one of the most important labor leaders in America.In 1954, as district one director of the United Packinghouse Workers of America, Charlie forced the union to acknowledge and address the employment concerns of women in the workplace.For more than three decades, this working man from Cairo, IL used his union office to fight for the rights of ordinary people.Charlie was an advocate for full national health care for every American before anyone ever heard of Medicare. He voiced strong support for protecting American jobs from foreign competition long before the international trade imbalance became a major national concern.Everywhere you looked, you saw Charlie Hayes standing up for the little guy. From strikes to marches. From jobs and civil rights issues to health care and housing concerns. You could always count on Charlie Hayes to be there when the going got tough.In 1983, the people of the First Congressional District of Illinois sent Charles Hayes to Congress to fight for them--and fight he did.I had the privilege of serving with him on both the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. He brought with him decades of hard work and experience on the front lines that helped him to make important contributions to both committees. He never forgot the struggle. He crafted every bill with a sincere commitment to securing justice and equality for working men and women.He introduced full employment legislation and denounced unemployment as morally unacceptable. While a number of politicians were arguing about how best to cut taxes on the rich, Charlie Hayes was arguing about how best to help those in our society who could not help themselves.When Charlie left Congress, he went back to Chicago to fight once again on the front lines with men and women who had served on the various task forces he formed while in Congress. Each day he fought the good fight.Though his struggle is over, Charlie's legacy will live on. We will always remember his strength of character, his love for life and his fighting spirit.I ask our colleagues to join me in honoring his wonderful life by continuing to champion the cause of American workers.I salute my dear friend Charlie Hayes and I bid him farewell.,2015-03-17 19:11:43.971099,2015-03-17 19:11:43.971099,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO CHARLES A.

2911,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,I see, Mr. Speaker, our time is just about to elapse.House Concurrent Resolution 84 will never become a household phrase, does not fall trippingly off the tongue, but that is the resolution that passed early this morning, about 3:30 this morning, by a 333 vote to 99 margin. This is a plan that will balance our Federal budget. It is going to restore economic freedom and opportunities for all Americans. To sum up what we have talked about, Mr. Speaker, this agreement saves and protects Medicare for the next decade which insures that older Americans will continue to have access to quality health care. Family farms and family businesses will finally have relief from the very punitive Federal inheritance tax. The forthcoming budget also calls for a reduction on the tax and savings and investment, otherwise known as capital gains which will create additional economic growth as we have discussed. There will be education initiatives for families who are wanting to put kids through school, additional funds available for Pell grants and moneys, much needed moneys, some $9 billion more for roads, for bridges and for infrastructure. Those are additional moneys, $8 billion over and above what the administration requested.This is a win-win budget.You know there was a lot of passionate debate, and I am honored the debate went well into the evening last night and early this morning. In fact this morning I have been answering some questions today because there were several substitute amendments and some have asked me why did you not support this version or that substitute amendment or that particular one; why did you support this one? And it was difficult for me to describe a day that happened a couple of weeks ago where we had had a very contentious day in this House, it had really been a tough day, debate had really become somewhat partisan, and I choose, Mr. Speaker, rather than going through the tunnel and walking through the maze back to my office over in Longworth, I decided on that day to walk out the front door out into the sunshine. It was a beautiful spring day; the clouds, not a cloud in the sky, a beautiful crisp day here in Washington, DC, and as I burst out the front doors of this House out into the sunshine, at the bottom of the steps of this Capitol there were about 35 or 40 high school students all dressed in their school colors, and their choir director facing them, and they were singing a four part harmony medley of patriotic songs.And in that instance, in that instant moment, suddenly the divisive debate melted away, and I thought of that moment, Mr. Speaker, last night, as we left the Chamber about 3:30 in the morning, because what we accomplished here last night was for those students and students and men and women all across this country just like them.This is truly a historic day for them and for all Americans.,2015-03-17 19:11:44.215267,2015-03-17 19:11:44.215267,House,BUDGET AGREEMENT,1997-05-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-05-21/html/CREC-1997-05-21-pt1-PgH3154-2.htm,68,21,143,H3154-H3162,H000948,mr. hulshof
2912,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to recognize an institution in southwest Missouri for promoting and laying the foundation upon which character is built. The institution I speak of is Southwest Missouri State University [SMSU] where I had the privilege to earn my master's in history. The award is the ``Templeton Foundation Honor Roll for Character Building Colleges.'' Some 135 institutions were selected out of 2,208 eligible universities and colleges. More impressive is that of the 6 percent of universities that were privileged to receive this award, only eight were public institutions and SMSU was the only public institution in Missouri to receive this award.In 1995, SMSU began a statewide mission in public affairs that focuses on developing traits within students that help them to become responsible citizens. That is why it is no surprise that SMSU would meet the standards needed to be recognized as a character building institution. Those standards considered as determinants of the award are the extent to which students are inspired to develop and strengthen their moral reasoning skills, the encouragement of spiritual growth and moral values, community building experiences, a drug-free lifestyle and whether the institution conducts critical assessments of its character-building programs and activities.SMSU begins to establish each of these values when students start their first year through forums where nationally known role models emphasize personal responsibility and character. Freshmen also attend a mandatory class that focuses on responsible citizenship in a learning community. This class teaches that drug and alcohol abuse will not be tolerated but also demonstrates alternatives that encourage physical, social, and spiritual well-being. Frequent roundtable discussions focus on incorporating principle values that help a learning institution like SMSU flourish. More than 20 religious organizations on campus are very active and play an influential role in student life. The city of Springfield has benefited from the community involvement of SMSU where just last year students, faculty, and staff contributed more than 69,500 hours of community service. SMSU students also are responsible for coordinating the nationwide ``Into the Streets'' program for the city of Springfield. SMSU surveys alumni and faculty to assess the civic involvement and also studies other universities to learn their assessment techniques.While I know that students, faculty, and staff of SMSU will celebrate this award, the community of Springfield and every parent whose child is attending SMSU should as well. Employees can know that when they hire someone with a degree from SMSU they can trust them to be faithful employees of character and good citizenship. Parents can be confident that when they send their children to SMSU they will learn not only book knowledge but also the values needed to produce good character.Finally may I add that we remember the words of Herbert Spencer when he said ``Education has for its object the formation of character.'' Thank you SMSU for making that your object as well.,2015-03-17 19:11:44.451442,2015-03-17 19:11:44.451442,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY,1997-09-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-23/html/CREC-1997-09-23-pt1-PgE1825.htm,128,0,143,E1825,B000575,mr. blunt
2913,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I was pleased this morning to honor the work of the Agricultural Research Service and the U.S. National Arboretum by planting a newly developed disease-resistant American elm on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. Joining me was Dr. Floyd Horn, Administrator of the Agricultural Research Service; Larry Coughlin, President of the Friends of the National Arboretum and former Congressman from Pennsylvania; my good friend, fellow tree junkie, and liberally utilized advisor, Dr. Tom Elias, Director of the National Arboretum; and Dr. Denny Townsend, the scientist who has spent a lifetime studying and developing new trees for cities and towns and the person responsible for developing this new American elm.I also want to thank the Architect of the Capitol, Mr. William Ensign and the Landscape Architect in his office, Mr. Matthew Evans for their professional assistance in facilitating this event.The Dutch elm disease has ravaged our native American elms for over 65 years and has largely eliminated these magnificent trees from cities and towns throughout the eastern and Midwestern United States. But now, with the help of Dr. Townsend, and the National Arboretum, we stand a great chance of seeing a return of the stately and valuable American elm.I am delighted to be the congressional sponsor of the tree planting ceremony to honor the many accomplishments of the National Arboretum and the ARS in their contributions to the city and town landscapes in the United States.The purpose of the ceremony was to recognize the National Arboretum of the Agricultural Research Service. Over 645 new and improved varieties of ornamental and floral plants have been developed and released. Truly a remarkable record. The Arboretum has given us hundreds of Glen Dale hybrid azaleas, several flowering pear trees, the very popular and widely grown hybrids and selections of crape myrtles and viburnums, a disease resistant sycamore suitable for city streets, new red maples, numerous hollies and magnolias, and now a series of new elms including Valley Forge and New Harmony.There is no question that the Arboretum has contributed greatly to the growth of the nursery and floral industries in the U.S. Their introductions, releases, and discoveries have helped to make the green industries the number one growth industry within Agriculture in America.I am especially proud of the new cooperative agreement recently entered into between the Arboretum and the University of Missouri. On February 7, 1996, a memorandum of understanding was signed to establish a U.S. National Arboretum Midwest Plant Research and Education Site at the Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center in New Franklin, MO.The new program will provide significant research and educational opportunities for all of us in our mission to discover, develop, and disseminate knowledge for the stewardship and sustainable use of human and natural resources. With this in mind, our planting at MU will be arranged to enable visitors, such as homeowners, and nurserymen to make easy comparisons between selections for their use. This relationship with the Arboretum will provide practical benefits to many ordinary Americans, while providing the research community at Missouri access to numerous vegetative types that can be used for scientific study and educational purposes. In Missouri, we are very excited about this new relationship with the Arboretum.I offer a hearty congratulations to Dr. Horn, Dr. Elias, and Dr. Townsend. Our country is grateful for people like you and your work in developing new and better trees, shrubs and other flower plants for the benefit of our national landscape and our environment. ,2015-03-17 19:11:44.717631,2015-03-17 19:11:44.717631,Senate,NATIONAL ABORETUM OF THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE,1996-06-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-06-06/html/CREC-1996-06-06-pt1-PgS5947-2.htm,82,0,142,S5947,B000611,mr. bond
2914,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.Mr. Chairman, I think that it would be worthwhile for some of the Members to know why many of us on this side of the aisle are not going to vote for this bill. I know that the gentleman from New Mexico, who I very strongly support in all the work that he has tried to do, is working under constraints not of his own making. It is the budget, which we are going to take up next, or sometime this evening, that is causing all the problems, but that budget cuts back severely on agriculture programs that will impact adversely, severely, on many rural districts, including my own.We need more money in here for rural water and sewer, for economic development in the rural areas. That all is possible and would have been possible under the coalition or the blue dog budget. But, no, we had to do the Republican budget, and it makes these severe cuts in agriculture. It is not only in the rural water and sewer areas, but it is also in rural housing that is cut back.I do not know why the Republican majority wants to devastate rural America, but it seems that they are bound and determined to do so.If we look at another area of that budget, at the Medicare area, we will find what the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid will mean. In my district, in rural areas, we are going to have hospitals close. So I am going to have hospitals closing down. I will not be able to provide housing for many of my people, and I am going to continue to have communities that do not have adequate sewer systems, do not have any sewer system at the present time, cannot afford it on their own, and yet they do not want to provide the funds that would be necessary.I had hoped that the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] would have offered his amendment to restore $27 million; $27 million is vitally needed in this program but we do not have it.I do not have any alternative, Mr. Chairman, but to vote in protest against this bill. I recognize that the gentleman from New Mexico and the gentleman from Illinois have done their best within the framework of what the budget of the Republican majority has given them, but I say to them that that is not enough.I do not blame the gentleman from New Mexico, I blame his leadership, not only for coming down on agriculture, but later on education and other programs as well. I do not plan to vote on those types of things either.Mr. Chairman, I think it is ill-conceived that they are trying to devastate rural America rather than helping it to grow, at the same time they say what they are doing is good for the country. I tell my colleagues this bill is not good for rural America. I believe that we have no alternative but to defeat the bill. I wish we could, but I know we will not be able to because we do not have the votes, the votes are over there to do it, but I want the people to know, the people of this House to know, that the gentleman from Missouri, Harold Volkmer, is not going to vote for a bill that devastates rural America.,2015-03-17 19:11:44.873743,2015-03-17 19:11:44.873743,House,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,1996-06-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-06-12/html/CREC-1996-06-12-pt1-PgH6236.htm,86,37,142,H6236-H6247,V000112,mr. volkmer
2915,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Chairman, I rise to oppose this partisan and politically motivated welfare bill that would push 1 million more children into poverty.Were it not for the fact that many have exploited this issue for raw political purposes, perhaps we could reform a welfare system badly in need of revision.Were it not for the fact that those promoting an agenda of slashing domestic assistance programs to finance unfair economic priorities, perhaps real welfare reform could be achieved. Were it not for the fact that the Republican majority in this House is willing to exploit the condition of our Nation's poor in a desperate attempt to resuscitate their extreme and failed agenda, perhaps a proposal could be framed that fostered realistic work requirements and compassionate safety nets.Rather than exhausting my time objecting to the most reprehensible provisions of this Republican plan, let me focus on some of the things that must be contained in any welfare reform bill I can support in good conscience:First, welfare reform must contain realistic work requirements, not harsh punitive measures devised to appeal to a crazed, cynical, public scapegoating of the poor. Most welfare recipients want what is best for themselves and their families. They want fulfilling jobs that pay a livable wage. But when those clamoring for workfare oppose adequate resources for job training, and education, their sincerity is called into question. When those championing workfare in place of welfare show no concern that jobs are available which pay decent wages, welfare reform is an empty vessel.Second, welfare reform must ensure that parents seeking to stay off welfare are able to leave their children in safe and healthy child care settings. Without adequate child care funding, welfare reform is a bizarre notion.Third, welfare reform must ensure that the poor are protected against hunger and illness.There must be an adequate contingency funding to shelter the poor against recessions. Adequate food stamps must be available for poor families so they don't starve, and, Medicaid must be preserved to protect welfare recipients from the range of health risks that threaten the medical well-being of the poor and the elderly.Welfare reform must preserve critical Federal efforts to protect children from abuse and neglect. It must not be used as a vehicle for reckless experimentation with those protections.Madam Chairman, we have a solemn responsibility to address the Nation's problems with logical, compassionate legislation. The Republican welfare bill before us has little to do with logic, compassion or the reform of welfare.I urge my colleagues to reject this misnamed, misdirected bill that espouses unrealistic, inhumane expectations. The architects of this flawed plan are willing to inflict suffering and misery on children. Their bill speaks volumes about the warped morality of those who would let children and the elderly starve.Madam Chairman, the mere consideration of this trashy legislation evidence that this Congress and the American people who insist on this perversion of decency have lost all sense of purpose. This assault on the poor is driven by dishonesty and deception. It constitutes a reckless abandonment of humane values.I urge its defeat.,2015-03-17 19:11:45.117909,2015-03-17 19:11:45.117909,House,WELFARE AND MEDICAID REFORM ACT OF 1996,1996-07-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-18/html/CREC-1996-07-18-pt1-PgH7796.htm,106,165,142,H7796-H7907,C000488,mr. clay
2916,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.Mr. Chairman, I agree that learning English should be a priority goal for all persons residing in the United States. In fact, there is extremely high demand for English language classes. Immigrants themselves recognize that in order to better their own lot, and that of their families, learning English is imperative. New arrivals to our shores flood English as a second language classes. In Washington, DC, 5,000 immigrants were turned away from English classes in the 1994 school year. In New York City, schools have had to resort to a lottery to determine enrollment. In Los Angeles, more than 40,000 applicants remain on waiting lists for English classes. In my view, we should expand Federal support for English as the second language and for bilingual education programs.My Republican colleagues characterize this bill as commonsense legislation. But it is neither common sense nor common decency to mandate exclusive use of English while utterly failing to address the practical need for adequate English-language preparation.This bill is not a mere declaration of English as the official language of the United States. It is hopelessly vague, ambiguous, unnecessary, unconstitutional legislation, searching for a solution to a nonproblem.With so little time remaining on the legislative calendar, the Republican majority has chosen to engage in an issue so potentially divisive. Instead of empowering people in the use of English by ensuring adequate funds for English as a second language classes, this bill attempts to protect the English language as though it were under some bizarre attack by other languages.This bill will obstruct such basic Government functions as tax collection, disaster preparation, water and resource conservation, and execution of civil and criminal laws and regulations. What logical public policy could this bill possibly support?This fall, the United States Supreme Court will hear oral argument regarding the constitutionality of an article in the Arizona Constitution which declares English the official language of the State and which mandates that all government business, with few exceptions, be conducted only in English. In light of that, consideration of this legislation is premature.As a matter of national policy, we should support both expanded opportunity to learn English and multilingualism. For that reason, I wholeheartedly embrace the Serrano substitute which views the diversity of our Nation, its people, its languages, and its cultures, as something to celebrate, not something to fear and resist. The Serrano substitute recognizes the benefits of multilingualism in protecting us in war, furthering our ability to communicate with the nations of the world, and enhancing our competitiveness in the global marketplace.I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 3898 and to support the Serrano English-Plus substitute.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:45.373096,2015-03-17 19:11:45.373096,House,ENGLISH LANGUAGE EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 1996,1996-08-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-08-01/html/CREC-1996-08-01-pt2-PgH9738-4.htm,116,5,142,H9738-H9772,C000488,mr. clay
2917,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, when the 105th Congress convenes next year, this body will regrettably be absent two of its most dedicated and distinguished public servants, the Honorable Pat Schroeder and the Honorable Cardiss Collins. It is with mixed feelings of pleasure and sadness that I rise today in tribute to these two extraordinary leaders.Congresswoman Schroeder and Congresswoman Collins have served the Congress longer and with greater dedication than few others. Among women Members, their longevity is virtually unmatched. As cofounders of the Congressional Women's Caucus they have shared in the historic mission of elevating this body's awareness and understanding of legislative issues of greatest concern to women. Both have served selflessly and tirelessly in the struggle for social justice and equality.Pat Schroeder and Cardiss Collins represent very different constituencies. Their legislative styles are distinct and they speak in somewhat different voices, but they have consistently spoken in unison on behalf of those who have been traditionally under-represented in the halls of Congress. The achievements of these two legislative giants are too numerous to recount and too phenomenal to address adequately in these few minutes. They each leave a legacy of achievements fulfilled. Pat has performed some miraculous feats as a member of the National Security Committee while Cardiss has left her signature on the business of the Commerce Committee. And both of these great Members of Congress has left her personal imprimatur on issues like health care, education, employment security, environmental protection, consumer safety, and civil rights and humanitarian causes.These two gentlewomen have made countless personal sacrifices and enormous contributions to this body and to the Nation. No truer advocates of peace, justice, and equality I have known in my 28 years in Congress. Congresswoman Cardiss Collins acts from the heart and steadfastly nurtures policies of fairness and virtue. Congresswoman Pat Schroeder speaks eloquently from her soul and illuminates the path to truth and justice.Mr. Speaker, the Congresswoman from Denver and the Congresswoman from Chicago have played magnificent roles in redirecting our future. They have moved our Nation closer toward realizing those principles of freedom and equality of which our Nation's founders paid lip service but to which they failed miserably in their shameless defense of racism and sexism. Our Nation and this institution have changed for the better by the dedicated contributions of these exceptional legislators.Representatives Schroeder and Collins have demonstrated the kind of faith and dedication that inspire the best in others. I will Pat's humor and I will miss Cardiss' determination, and I will especially miss their generous support and friendship.

2918,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with great reluctance and disappointment that I rise in support of this legislation. I have been disappointed by suggestions by those on the other side of the aisle that the President of the United States has somehow broken a promise or gone back on his word. I think that assertion is absolutely wrong. If we look back at the agreement and the original continuing resolution, the President did not agree to put down a 7-year budget scored by CBO by a certain time, no more than the Republican side agreed that they would put down a budget that he would score as being sufficient for his priorities of saving Medicare and Medicaid and not giving tax cuts to the wealthy paid for by the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. The agreement was that when a negotiation yielded a hoped-for settlement or agreement, that that agreement would balance the budget in 7 years. The President has kept that agreement, not just the letter of that agreement, but the spirit of that agreement.When we go from working in the Congress, as we do under the Constitution, to either override a veto or to pass another bill, we move into a different realm. That realm is now a room in the White House. It is a negotiation in private to try to reach an agreement that is good for the country. I have been in the meetings. I find it abhorrent for people to say that he is not acting in good faith. That is not what I have seen and heard.I participated in the summit in 1990 with President Bush. The negotiators spent all of about an hour with President Bush in 1990. I am not complaining. We talked with Richard Darman who was his representative in the negotiation.In this negotiation, which has been going on for days, this President has sat in the room for at least 40 hours, face-to-face with the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, and he is painstakingly working the details to find an agreement that, yes, will balance the budget in 7 years, by CBO judgment, but which will also meet his requirements of saving Medicare and Medicaid, saving education and the environment, and not slashing those programs to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.Now because somehow the President has not passed somebody's sincerity test, and for what reason I cannot tell my colleagues, we now have before us a measure which makes no sense. Who can explain to anybody why we are going to bring people back to work and pay them, in some cases for doing nothing? Last week we paid people to stay at home; next week I guess we are going to pay them to do nothing. We ought to put another proviso in this to provide people crossword puzzles so they will have something to do in the office. This makes no earthly sense.I beg the majority to come to their senses. They have achieved what they wanted to achieve. This President is negotiating in good faith.In the name of sense and decency, let these negotiations go on, and let us get an honest compromise and a balanced budget that recognizes the priorities of the American people.,2015-03-17 19:11:45.910474,2015-03-17 19:11:45.910474,House,DISPOSING OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1643, EXTENSION OF MOST-FAVORED- NATION TREATMENT FOR BULGARIA,1996-01-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-01-05/html/CREC-1996-01-05-pt1-PgH193-2.htm,3,197,142,H193-H216,G000132,mr. gephardt
2919,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, today I join my colleague, Senator Kit Bond, in introducing legislation that addresses one of the greatest challenges of our Nation: assuring quality health care for pregnant women and appropriate pediatric care for infants. Our bill, the Healthy Kids 2000 Act, builds upon the Birth Defects Prevention Act signed into law last April, by consolidating programs and providing more funds for local initiatives to prevent birth defects and maternal mortality.The idea behind our proposal is simple: we want pregnant women to be healthy, and we want children to be healthy. To accomplish this, we must remove some of the barriers women and children encounter in receiving adequate, appropriate health care.The Healthy Kids 2000 Act will allow States greater flexibility in ensuring quality prenatal care by allowing States to enroll eligible pregnant women in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), for which Congress provided $25 billion in 1997 to assist 10 million uninsured children in receiving the most basic health care. A recent study by the March of Dimes estimates that 45,000 uninsured pregnant women who are not eligible for Medicaid could be covered by S-CHIP if States were given the flexibility of extending coverage to income eligible pregnant women age 19 or older.Additionally, the bill increases enrollment of Medicaid-eligible pregnant women. Currently, approximately 77 percent of uninsured pregnant women are eligible for Medicaid but are not enrolled. The bill also ensures direct access to obstetric care for women, and direct access to pediatric care, since children have health needs that are very different than those of the adult population.Another crucial element of our bill allows our Nation's independent children's hospitals to receive Federal funding for graduate medical education. Currently, children's hospitals receive almost no Federal GME funding. With few Medicare patients, these children's hospitals receive less than $400 in Federal funds for each medical resident they train, while other teaching hospitals receive on average more than $79,000 for each resident--creating a serious inequity in the competitive market for these children's hospitals. As these hospitals try to fulfill their teaching missions, competitive market pressures provide little incentive for private payers to contribute toward teaching costs.In an effort to reduce our Nation's infant death rate and to improve the chances of healthy birth outcomes, the Healthy Kids 2000 Act establishes a National Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention, and strengthens local initiatives for drug, alcohol, and smoking prevention and cessation programs for pregnant mothers. An estimated 150,000 infants are born each year with a birth defect, resulting in one out of every five infant deaths. More children die in the U.S. from birth defects in the first year of life than from any other cause. Effective locally-based programs will prevent these horrific outcomes by equipping mothers, families, and health care providers with information and approaches needed to ensure women safer pregnancies.Furthermore, our bill increases funding for the National Institutes of Health by creating the Pediatric Research Initiative, which will provide further money to research efforts on diseases and conditions which afflict our Nation's children, such as birth defects, SIDS, cystic fibrosis, juvenile diabetes, and muscular dystrophy.Our health care professionals in southern Missouri and across the Nation work very hard to provide the highest quality care for our children. The reality is that pediatric care, like all health care, does cost money. We need to take positive steps to ensure that every mother-to-be and their children are able to access this quality care. I am very pleased to again be working with Senator Bond on an important children's health initiative. On behalf of our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, I urge my colleagues to review the Healthy Kids 2000 Act, to discuss this bill with families in their districts, and to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.,2015-03-17 19:11:46.292750,2015-03-17 19:11:46.292750,Extensions,THE HEALTHY KIDS 2000 ACT,1999-03-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-11/html/CREC-1999-03-11-pt1-PgE424-2.htm,39,0,145,E424-E425,E000172,mrs. emerson
2920,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Charlie ``Yardbird'' Parker as the Charlie Parker Memorial Site is dedicated at 17th Terrace and Vine Street in my hometown of Kansas City, Missouri. Charlie Parker was a bebop innovator. He not only shaped the sound of modern jazz in the 1940s, but he has also served as an inspiration to all jazz musicians since that time. His alto sax virtuosity marked the zenith of the jazz age and set a standard for other musicians to aspire to.Charlie Parker's family settled in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1927, when Parker was only 7 years old. While growing up there, he pursued his musical education on the stages of Kansas City. By 1936, when Charlie Parker turned 16, Kansas City music had begun to influence the national jazz scene. Parker was a big part of this explosion, having obtained his union card at the age of 14. He spent a few years idolizing and studying Lester Young's saxophone playing, and then continued his studies under Buster Smith, one of the early stars of County Basie's Reno Club band and Walter Page's Blue Devils. By 1938, Parker was playing in the Jay McShann band, the last great band to play in Kansas City, as the principal soloist. The McShann band's national success after 1944 meant that Parker would no longer play in Kansas City.It was in New York that Charlie Parker got his nickname of ``Yardbird'' because he loved to eat fried chicken. From the time he arrived in New York until he passed away on March 12, 1955, his success escalated. As the news of his passing spread, ``Bird Lives'' began to appear all over New York and the nation because his fans refused to let him die. Although he is buried in Lincoln Cemetery in Kansas City, he lives on in the hearts of jazz lovers everywhere. From March 25th through the 27th the nation's ears will focus on Kansas City, where some of Charlie Parker's contemporaries will gather to remember the great jazz legend at the American Jazz Museum in the 18th and Vine Historic Jazz District. Max Roach, Dr. Billy Taylor, Jay McShann, Milt Jackson, Claude ``The Fiddler'' Williams, and Ernie Andrews are a few of the internationally acclaimed artists who are participating in the Symposium and Concert celebration.This weekend's dedication of the new Charlie Parker Memorial will remind us all of this great musician and inspire the jazz musician in all of us to hum a little bebop: ``Hello, Little Girl, don't you remember me? I mean, been so long, but I had a break you see.'' (from ``Hootie Blue,'' recorded for Decca Records by the Jay McShann Orchestra, April 30, 1941, Parker's first commercial recording session).,2015-03-17 19:11:46.592958,2015-03-17 19:11:46.592958,Extensions,IN HONOR OF THE LATE CHARLIE PARKER,1999-03-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-24/html/CREC-1999-03-24-pt1-PgE537-3.htm,47,0,145,E537,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2921,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of the Democratic alternative and against the Republican budget, and I want to say tonight that I think we have to look at this issue from the viewpoint of people sitting around their kitchen table at home tonight looking at the issues that are involved in this budget.It is not about charts, it is not about graphs, it is not about statistics, it is not about numbers. It is about ideas that make sense to ordinary Americans, working families who are sitting around the breakfast table or the dinner table talking about the problems that they face. What would they like to see happen in this budget?First of all, they want Medicare and Social Security stabilized and extended, probably the two most important programs in peoples' lives. They are popular programs, important programs on an everyday basis. The Democratic budget extends the life of Medicare by 12 years and the life of Social Security by 18 years.We have a letter from the actuaries that say that our budget does that. They are not Republican actuaries or Democratic actuaries. They are actuaries, and their job is to give us information about ideas, and the Democratic idea they say extends the life of those two programs; in the one case, by 12; in the other case, by 18 years.The Republican budget does not have that letter from the actuaries, so if our colleagues are worried about Medicare and Social Security, then they ought to vote for the Democratic budget.The second thing people, I think, would like to do is pay down debt, pay down back debt so that we pass along less back debt to our children and grandchildren and we have less carrying cost or interest cost in future budgets. The Democratic budget is much better on that score.The third thing they would like is targeted tax cuts, tax cuts that go to their problems. What are their problems? Long term care for their parents; that is a problem. We can have a targeted tax cut under the Democratic budget for that. They want tax cuts that have to do with U.S.A. accounts. I think the idea of being able to put more savings behind their Social Security so that they can have additional moneys to live on in their retirement is a very attractive idea that is in our budget.The fourth thing that I think they are interested in is being able to have more funds available for education, for smaller class size, for more teachers, for health care, for housing, for the needs that people have on an everyday basis.To me this whole issue is very simple. If we look at it through the eyes of ordinary American families who are out there tonight sitting around a table, if we are looking at the things that they care about, what I call kitchen table, everyday problems, this Democratic budget is far superior to the Republican budget on those issues, on those grounds.This is a simple choice that Members have to make tonight.I urge Members to vote for the Democratic alternative. If we get the votes to pass it tonight, it will be the budget of the United States, and I think it should be the budget of the United States because it is the budget of working families in this country.,2015-03-17 19:11:46.855151,2015-03-17 19:11:46.855151,House,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,1999-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-25/html/CREC-1999-03-25-pt1-PgH1710-2.htm,48,380,145,H1710-H1780,G000132,mr. gephardt
2922,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retiring Consul General of Japan in Kansas City, Missouri, Mr. Tatsuo Tanaka. He has served Japan in the capacity of Consul General for 3 years, and has served his country in numerous capacities for more than thirty years. Throughout his tenure, he has worked successfully toward strengthening the bonds between the United States and Japan. Mr. Tanaka has forged strong ties between Missouri's fifth district and Japan, and his presence will be missed, although I am positive that his good work will continue.Mr. Tanaka served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 1962. He has worked in Pakistan, Bonn, and the United States to develop Japan's relationship with these countries. Mr. Tanaka has also done extensive research on the development of electronic money and the implications and benefits of the uses of e-money. Although he represents Japan and Japan's specific interests throughout the world, he is committed to recognizing the importance of international relations and the emergence of a global economy.The Consulate General of Japan at Kansas City was established in 1979 and serves Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Its mission is to foster exchanges between Japan and this region in a variety of consular, commercial, cultural, and educational areas, and to assist Japanese and U.S.-Japan interests in this region. The United States-Japan conference last year held in my district helped to solidify the relationships between American and Japanese businesses.My district has close ties with Japan. For instance, three Kansas City area companies have a strong presence in Japan: Butler Japan, Inc., AMC Entertainment, Inc., and Farmland Industries, Inc. Butler Japan markets construction products and services of Butler Construction Company. Since October 1989, Butler Japan has sold many industrial type buildings to Japanese companies, such as Honda, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Com., Sanyo, Sony, Toshiba, and Toyota. AMC Entertainment launched its export of theaters to Japan in April 1996 in Mr. Tanaka's hometown of Fukuoka, Japan. AMC's project in Japan has been a tremendous success. Farmland Industries, the largest farmer owned cooperative in North America, began doing business with Japan in 1987. This company now supplies pork, beef, grain, and fertilizer products to the Japanese market. Mr. Tanaka's work to build Japan-U.S. relations in the midwest has definitely contributed to the success of these American business ventures.Mr. Tanaka has also worked to increase the amount of cultural and educational exchange between the United States and Japan. An example of his success in this area is the growth of the Japanese Exchange and Teaching (JET) program. The JET program hires college graduates to teach English in Japanese schools. Currently, there are approximately 2500 American college graduates working in English education and international understanding throughout Japan.Although Tatsuo Tanaka will be leaving the Kansas City area, I know that we will continue our friendship. I benefitted greatly from his wisdom and guidance when I served my U.S.-Japan Society Fellowship in Japan and also have appreciated he and his wife Eri Tanaka's hospitality on many occasions.I also welcome a continued relationship with the office of the Consul General, as well as a continued partnership between the Fifth District and Japan.,2015-03-17 19:11:47.121333,2015-03-17 19:11:47.121333,Extensions,HONORING THE CONSUL GENERAL OF JAPAN, TATSUO TANAKA,1999-04-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-14/html/CREC-1999-04-14-pt1-PgE642.htm,51,0,145,E642,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2923,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Con. Res. 92 and to express my condolences and sympathy to the victims' families and to the citizens of Littleton, Colorado, in the wake of the tragic shooting that occurred there last week. What can we as a Congress say to our children and their parents in light of such a devastating event? This resolution states that the House of Representatives ``condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous atrocities which occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado; offers its condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those who were killed at Columbine High School and expresses its hope for the rapid and complete recovery of those wounded in the shooting; applauds the hard work and dedication exhibited by the hundreds of local, state, and federal law enforcement officials and the others who offered their support and assistance; and encourages the American people to engage in a national dialogue on preventing school violence.''It is important to pass this resolution and officially state our condemnation, condolences, and hope, and yet it is not enough. How will we, as individual Members of the House of Representatives, choose to act in response to this atrocity? Will we be satisfied with the passing of this resolution? We must not allow ourselves to believe that with this resolution, we have done all that we could. We must honor the memory of those that were killed: Dave Sanders, Kyle Velasquez, Matt Kechter, Corey DePooter, Steven Curnow, Isaiah Shoels, Rachel Scott, John Tomlin, Lauren Townsend, Kelly Fleming, Dan Rohrbough, Dan Mauser, and Cassie Bernall. I say their names aloud on this day, in this room, to honor their memory and to urge my colleagues to remember that this teacher and these children had bright futures that will never be realized.Vice President Al Gore asked the community of Littleton at the memorial ceremony on Sunday, ``Now, as we are brought to our knees in the shock of this moment, what say we?'' I repeat this question to you, my colleagues. What say we in the shock of this moment, and what will we say as the shock passes and our lives go on, even as the lives of those thirteen have ended? Will we say, ``No more!''? Or will we turn away from the harsh reality of the world we have helped to create and hide our faces from the dangers our children face every day?We must provide for our children alternatives to violence and opportunities for creative expression which will allow them to deal with their anger and hurt in productive ways. A pilot educational intervention program being developed in the fifth district of Missouri is the E3 system--Emotional and Ethical Education for Children. This curriculum seeks to foster the emotional, cognitive, and ethical development of children through the arts. The E3 system utilizes the theory of multiple intelligences and the arts within the curriculum in order to increase test scores and decrease conflicts and violence. Strong arts programs in schools provide emotional outlets for children and teach them to deal with their emotions without resorting to violence. We must make arts in schools a federal initiative and an essential component to the solution we all seek.I urge my colleagues to remember the shock of this moment as we debate and consider bills in the upcoming months that raise difficult questions regarding individual freedoms and the safety of our children. Let us put partisanship aside as we enter these debates, and let us each consider in our own hearts the responsibility that we hold for the children of this nation and their future.,2015-03-17 19:11:47.378522,2015-03-17 19:11:47.378522,House,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THE TRAGIC SHOOTING AT COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL IN LITTLETON, COLORADO,1999-04-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-27/html/CREC-1999-04-27-pt1-PgH2327-2.htm,58,45,145,H2327-H2335,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2924,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you, Mr. President.I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this issue. I began to be concerned about students carrying guns in and out of our schools quite some time ago. On the Ed-Flex bill, which passed this Senate just a couple months ago, I put an amendment to close another loophole which would allow students who possessed guns in school--not just carried guns to school--to be removed from the school environment.This responsibility for us to close these loopholes is a serious one. It is a responsibility that relates to school safety. That is what we are talking about here. School safety is a responsibility that we can work hard on, and I am glad Senator Frist of Tennessee and I have been able to join on this amendment.It should not have taken this long. This is a simple amendment. This amendment merely allows local schools to treat all children who bring guns to school in the same manner. It does not target children with disabilities--simply not so. It protects children with disabilities. This is not a matter of scapegoating. This does not say that any group of students is subject to more severe punishments than any other group of students.This is a bill that provides for equity, simply saying that principals and superintendents should have the power, without interference from the Federal Government, to remove students from school who come to school with a firearm, an explosive or a gun. I believe we need to make sure we close the loophole in the Federal law that made it very difficult to discipline certain students who came in that setting.There are those who say: Well, the law is this way and the law is that way. And they will argue about how the law is applied here in the Senate Chamber. We have a lot of experience from around the country about how the law is applied in the schools. The Senator from Tennessee has eloquently spoken to the fact that as applied in the schools, you frequently find that individuals who, if they were not the subject of an individualized education program, would be gone for a year because of a mandated expulsion, are back in the classroom within 45 days, in spite of the fact that they brought a gun or a bomb to school.It is simply our intention to let local school boards and school officials decide how they should be able to make the school a safe place and not to reinsert a student in the school environment who has threatened the safety and security of the school by bringing a bomb or a gun to school. We must have zero tolerance for guns in school. I think we must let school officials decide on discipline policies.We should not have taken this long on this amendment, but I am glad that we are at this point.After we vote on this amendment, there is a consent decree which is going to allow the Harkin amendment to be voted on.,2015-03-17 19:11:47.633704,2015-03-17 19:11:47.633704,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-20/html/CREC-1999-05-20-pt1-PgS5683.htm,74,49,145,S5683-S5732,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2925,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, on July 9, 1999, Reverend Walter J. Keisker will celebrate his 100th birthday. As an active member of his community, Reverend Keisker is as well known in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri as many of the founding fathers of the towns of Jackson and Cape Girardeau.Pastor Keisker started his life in 1899 on a farm four miles outside of Hillsboro, Missouri where his father ran a small creamery and, later, raised dairy herd and hogs. To this day, the Reverend remembers the words to ``A Surrey With the Fringe on Top'' because his family actually traveled in one.The Reverend attended high school and junior college at St. Paul College in St. Louis, graduating in 1919. He then continued his education at Concordia Lutheran Seminary from which he graduated in 1923. He lead his first parish at Trinity Church in Flat River, now Park Hills, Missouri where he devoted 15 years of service. In the fall of 1938 Pastor Keisker took on a new parish at the St. Paul Lutheran Church in Jackson, Missouri. He gave his parish his full attention for the next 30 years. As Pastor Keisker eased into retirement, he continued serving St. Paul Lutheran Church as a pastoral assistant from 1968 until 1984. The Reverend continued to be actively involved in the church until 1993 when he moved to the Lutheran Home in Cape Girardeau.Reverend Keisker and the former Mae Fikuart of Farmington, Missouri, married and had two daughters, Ruth Illers of Jackson, Missouri, and Virginia Goodwin of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The Reverend and Mrs. Keisker had seven grandchildren and as of this spring, Pastor Keisker has ten great grandchildren. Mrs. Keisker passed away in 1992.Because he believes that a pastor should be active in their communities as well as over his congregation, Pastor Keisker remains active today. He continues to be a member of the Cape Girardeau Historical Society and the Jackson Chamber of Commerce, and he attends Circuit meetings and other events in his community.When asked about his secret for longevity, Pastor Keisker gives the following pieces of advice: ``I think the Lord intended for us to enjoy life, so keep yourself occupied; Don't go out with the owls at night. They don't keep the right kind of company anyway; always be grateful for what you have; Be yourself and don't try to imitate someone you think is doing a good job. Try to do the job yourself, but please don't mimic.These are sage words of advice from a centenarian who has lived a life devoted to God, family, and community, who has seen and reflected on a century of change in our nation and the world, and who has selflessly given of himself to all he has known. I would like to extend a heart-felt thank you to Pastor Keisker for all that he has done and continues to do for our communities. He is truly an inspiration to us all.,2015-03-17 19:11:47.862867,2015-03-17 19:11:47.862867,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO PASTOR WALTER J.

2926,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, in November 1998, the Small Business Administration's Veterans Affairs Task Force for Entrepreneurship filed its report. The task force examined all SBA programs, including business development, education and training, financial assistance, government contracting and advocacy to determine ways to improve SBA's ability to assist veterans. The task force identified certain high priority recommendations. It is the purpose of this bill, H.R. 1568, to implement those high priority recommendations.First, the task force recommended guaranteed loan opportunities. H.R. 1568 makes veterans eligible for funds under the microloan, Delta Loan and State Development Company programs. This enables veterans to access capital markets currently available to women, low-income, minority entrepreneurs and other business owners possessing the capability to operate successful business concerns.Second, the task force identified an outreach program to assist disabled veterans in business training and management assistance. H.R. 1568 amends the Small Business Development Act to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the small business development center associations to train all veterans, including disabled veterans, in business training and management assistance, procurement opportunities and other business areas.Third, the task force urged a veterans company or corporation to address veterans small business issues. The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act creates the National Veterans Business Development Corporation. This corporation will coordinate private and public resources from Federal organizations, for example, the SBA and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to establish and maintain a network of information and assistance centers for use by veterans and the public. H.R. 1568 requires the National Veterans Business Development Corporation to become self-sustaining by eliminating the corporation's minimal Federal funding in 4 years.Fourth, the task force sought a regulation classifying veteran-owned businesses as a socially and economically disadvantaged business group. Rather than a regulation, H.R. 1568 affords veteran-owned small businesses an opportunity to compete on the same level with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Phelps) for offering his amendment which guarantees that reservists in different businesses, say, plumbing, electrician or contractor small business owners who are called to active duty, guarantees them the ability to access loans to keep the business afloat while the reservist/small business owner serves our country. Mr. Speaker, the law already protects employees called to active duty as it should. Thanks to this amendment, it will soon provide some protection to the small business owner.Mr. Speaker, we all recognize our Armed Forces safeguard our freedoms and liberty at great sacrifice to our servicemen. Our veterans liberated Europe and the Pacific in the 1940s, they stopped the spread of communism in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and they freed oppressed peoples in the 1980s and 1990s. These men and women willingly sacrificed for their country. H.R. 1568, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, provides them the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labor and the blessings of liberty which they secured.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1568.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:47.995961,2015-03-17 19:11:47.995961,House,VETERANS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1999,1999-06-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-06-29/html/CREC-1999-06-29-pt1-PgH5016.htm,94,3,145,H5016-H5026,T000024,mr. talent
2927,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators Chafee, Rockefeller, Reed, Moynihan, Breaux, Conrad, Jeffords, Mikulski, and Landrieu to introduce the Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999. This important piece of legislation will provide transitional assistance for the estimated 20,000 youths in the United States who ``age out'' of the foster care system at the age of 18 without a permanent family.This legislation builds on the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children (PASS) Act that I co-sponsored in 1997. The Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999 increases the funding for the independent living program in order to provide basic living needs, such as housing and food. Additionally, the increased funding provides states the option to grant Medicaid for health care, including mental health needs, to former foster children up to their 21st birthdays as a condition of receiving the increased funding.This legislation also guarantees that state programs are well supervised and provides a wide range of support which focuses on health, safety, and permanency goals. In addition, the bill allows children who receive aid under the independent living program to have assets or resources totaling $10,000, in contrast to the old requirement of $1,000, which deterred foster children from saving money for a sound future.Mr. President, at age 18 foster care children are suddenly expected to be adults, able to take care of themselves. That is not a reasonable expectation, especially for kids deprived of a nurturing parent or other caring adult. As these youths age out of foster care without a permanent family or a structure of continued support, many lack a high school education, have difficulty maintaining employment, and often experience high levels of depression and discouragement. Research has proven that a significant number of homeless shelters users had recently been discharged from foster care. Other studies found that former foster care youth 2\1/2\ to 4 years after they ``aged out'' of foster care found that 46% of the youths had not completed high school, approximately 40% were dependent on public assistance or Medicaid and 42% had given birth or fathered a child.Mr. President, I know first hand how this legislation can impact our nation's foster care children. In my home state of Missouri, Epworth Children and Family Services, in St. Louis, provides resources needed to help people who fall through the cracks of a system that is not strong enough to help build a future for foster care children ``aging out'' of foster care. Robin, an 18-year-old foster care youth, was all alone in the world when she entered Epworth's Independent Living Program. Her father was never a part of her life and her mother was serving time in jail. Motivated by the desire to regain custody of her two-year-old baby boy, Robin started the program with high hopes. However Robin struggled as she worked with the caring staff at Epworth. Despite attempts by the professional at Epworth to stretch limited resources to address Robin's ongoing needs, their system failed Robin. She was removed from Epworth by the Missouri Division of Family Services. Robin needed more support, more staff interaction and more resources than the Epworth program could provide.Mr. President, the Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999 provides significant assistance to assure that these foster care youth who ``age out'' of the system are provided with the assistance needed to transition out of foster care into independence. The provisions in this bill will assist these youth to begin a supervised and nurtured life outside of the foster care system. They will be given the time and resources they need to enter adulthood prepared. This independent living initiative would give many ``Robins'' the change to be self-sufficient and to contribute to her community. This means a better life for all of our children.,2015-03-17 19:11:48.241136,2015-03-17 19:11:48.241136,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1999-07-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-01/html/CREC-1999-07-01-pt2-PgS8085-2.htm,96,59,145,S8085-S8140,B000611,mr. bond
2928,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her kind remarks and for allowing me to speak on this important issue.Americans are now paying taxes at a higher rate than ever before. The burden and cost of the government are more, and the Federal Government is responsible for the overwhelming lion's share. As a matter of fact, we are not just responsible for the Federal taxes, because we have mandated so many programs on State and local governments we are responsible for a lot of what they are taxing people. So we are being taxed at the highest rates in history--at the highest rates in history.Now we announced, in spite of that, we are paying more in those taxes than it costs to run Government. We are paying more in than it costs to fund the programs we are getting. If you go to a grocery store and you are buying $8 worth of groceries and you give them a $10 bill, you are paying more than it costs for the service and they give you a couple of dollars in change.There is a stunning debate in Washington. We are debating over whether or not to give people the change back. They are paying more than is required for the programs they have requested, and we are debating whether or not we are going to give them the change back. We ought to give the money back. They own it. They have overpaid.No. 1, we are paying the highest taxes in history. No. 2, those taxes pay for more than what our programs cost; therefore, we are overpaying. No. 3, we ought to refund that overpayment to the American people.I submit among those who ought to be the first in line to get money back are those who have been particularly abused, those who have been the subject of discrimination, those who have been the subject of wrongful taking of the money by Government. That is where you come to this class of people who are not normally thought of as being a special class. They are married people. Forty-two percent of all the married people in the United States end up penalized for being married. That is 21 million families. Mr. President, 21 million families pay an average of over $100 a month--that is $1,400 a year--because we have what is called the marriage penalty tax.Before we decide on tax relief for the population generally, let's take some of these gross inequities out of the system, especially inequities that target one of the most important, if not the most important, components of the community we call America--our families. Our families are the most important department of social services, the most important department of education. The most important fundamental component of the culture is the family. It is where we will either succeed or fail in the next century. Our Tax Code has been focusing on those families and has been saying we are going to take from you more than we would take from anybody else.This idea of penalizing people for being married is a bankrupt idea, and it is time to take the marriage penalty part of this law and administer the death penalty to the marriage tax.I say it is time for us to end the marriage penalty. This will mean a substantial improvement in income for people who have been suffering discrimination because they are married. It is time for us to end the marriage penalty in the tax law.,2015-03-17 19:11:48.487304,2015-03-17 19:11:48.487304,Senate,TAX CUTS,1999-07-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-13/html/CREC-1999-07-13-pt1-PgS8310-4.htm,98,4,145,S8310-S8311,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2929,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Association of People with Aids (NAPWA)--the leading advocate on behalf of all people living with HIV and AIDS in order to end the pandemic and human suffering caused by HIV/AIDS.NAPWA was founded in 1983 in Denver, Colorado, at the Second National AIDS Forum. This organization has been at the forefront of the AIDS epidemic to address the issues of equality and equal access to treatment and prevention methods regardless of race, gender, class, or sexual orientation. On Saturday, July 31, 1999, NAPWA will hold their Annual Retreat in Kansas City, Missouri, including a public forum on ``AIDS Now and in the New Millennium,'' where a panel of leading experts, including Sandy Thurman, Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, will discuss the latest developments in the effort to end the AIDS crisis. This forum will provide an opportunity for city, county, state, and national leaders, AIDS Service organizations, HIV infected individuals, health departments, faith communities, and medical professionals to talk about issues surrounding the AIDS epidemic and the funding that is needed to maintain quality health care services and innovative prevention strategies.At this forum, NAPWA will welcome Roger A. Gooden--an AIDS survivor and tireless advocate for people with AIDS--as the newly elected Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Gooden has a rich history of fighting for AIDS/HIV treatment and prevention, as well as for the rights of people with AIDS. He currently serves on the State of Missouri's Governor's Council on AIDS and the Board of Directors of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence of Greater Kansas City. Recently, Mr. Gooden was honored by the Missouri Department of Health Division of Environmental Health and Communicable Disease Prevention, Bureau of HIV/AIDS Care and Prevention Services, in recognition of his dedication and service to the State of Missouri in advocating for people living with HIV/AIDS and the prevention of the spread of HIV. Mr. Gooden was also honored by Kansas City Mayor Emanual Cleaver and the City Council with a resolution and proclamation recognizing his election as Chairman of the Board of NAPWA and for his dedicated service and efforts in the fight against AIDS.NAPWA is an active and effective organization, providing many services to legislators and people with AIDS/HIV. For instance, NAPWA provides Community Education, Technical Assistance, and Regional Training Workshops around the country for people with HIV, to give them the skills they need to participate in HIV prevention community planning with Ryan White CARE Act Planning Bodies. NAPWA also coordinates a diverse national network of committed public speakers through the Leadership Development Initiative. This initiative, coupled with the Youth Initiative involves outreach services where peers talk to peers about AIDS and HIV, encouraging each other to modify risk behaviors and change attitudes toward people with AIDS/HIV.NAPWA also participates in a wide array of prevention, health promotion, and educational efforts for those infected with and at risk for HIV. NAPWA publishes several fact sheets, alerts, and reports, as well as supporting an Information and Referral Service, to provide the nation with up-to-date and accurate information about the AIDS pandemic. NAPWA also sponsors National HIV Testing Day in June of each year, to encourage early and frequent testing for HIV/AIDS, especially for those who are at higher risk.Mr. Speaker, NAPWA's highest priority is the development of effective new treatments and a cure for HIV disease. Please join me in commending NAPWA for its tireless efforts on behalf of people with AIDS.,2015-03-17 19:11:48.741485,2015-03-17 19:11:48.741485,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PEOPLE WITH AIDS (NAPWA),1999-07-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-28/html/CREC-1999-07-28-pt1-PgE1672-3.htm,108,0,145,E1672-E1673,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2930,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize La Leche League International (LLLI), the World Alliance for Breastfeeding, National Breastfeeding Month, August 1999, and World Breastfeeding Week, August 1-7, 1999. The theme for World Breastfeeding Week this year is Breastfeeding: Education for Life, sponsored by LLLI and WABA. World Breastfeeding Week is part of WABA's ongoing campaign to increase public awareness of the importance of breastfeeding. LLLI is a founding member of WABA's global alliance of health care providers, non-governmental organizations, and mother support groups.This week, all over the world, people will be participating in the World Walk for Breastfeeding, organized by La Leche League International, an international nonprofit organization that provides breastfeeding information and encouragement through mother-to-mother support groups and interactions with parents, physicians, researchers, and health care providers. LLLI reaches over 200,000 women monthly in 66 countries.This year's World Walk for Breastfeeding will be the ninth annual walk, and my community of the Greater Kansas City area will be participating through twelve local La Leche groups. The Walk is a fundraiser for LLLI, and a portion of the money raised will stay with the local groups to fund their outreach and support activities.Breastfeeding has been identified by the U.S. Surgeon General as a high priority objective for the year 2000, with the goal of increasing to at least 75 percent the proportion of mothers who breastfeed their infants in the early postpartum period and to at least 50 percent those who breastfeeding until the infant is six months of age. All available knowledge indicates that human milk optimally enhances the growth, development, and well being of the infant by providing the best possible nutrition, protection against specific infection and allergies, and the promotion of maternal and infant bonding. Further, breastfeeding is economical and promotes healthier mothers, and it benefits society through lower health care costs for infants, a healthier workforce, stronger family bonds, and less waste.August 1 makes the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Innocenti Declaration on the Protections, Promotion, and Support of Breastfeeding which was adopted in 1990 by 32 governments and 10 United Nations Agencies. This Declaration states: AS a global goal for optimal maternal and child health and nutrition, all women should be enabled to practice exclusive breastfeeding and all infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to four to six months of age. Thereafter, children should continue to breastfeed while receiving appropriate and adequate complementary foods for up to two years of age or beyond. This child feeding ideal is to be achieved by creating an appropriate environment of awareness and support so that women can benefit in this manner.Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating National Breastfeeding Month and World Breastfeeding Week, and let us lend our support to this global effort to nurture our infants and provide them with the best possible nutrition in the first months of their lives.,2015-03-17 19:11:49.073726,2015-03-17 19:11:49.073726,Extensions,LA LECHE LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL,1999-08-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-08-05/html/CREC-1999-08-05-pt2-PgE1777.htm,114,0,145,E1777,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2931,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today first to congratulate the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) for their excellent across-the-aisle, bipartisan work in bringing about this legislation. I might say that I hope that this bipartisan effort that they have put together with lots of Members from both parties is something that we cannot only win with today, but have repeated with other bills: the patients' bill of rights, education. We ought to be able to find a way to work across party lines to get things done for the American people. I want to congratulate both of them vociferously for the hard work that they have done day in and day out to get us to where we are today.I would also like to recognize the work of our Democratic Blue Dogs and their discharge petition effort which forced the leadership to take our demands for a vote on campaign reform seriously. Because of their work, 202 Members of the House signed the discharge petition, urging the Republican leadership to bring Shays-Meehan to the floor, and we are able to be here today on the floor discussing this because of that discharge petition and the work that was done, again, in a bipartisan way to get this on the floor.The truth is, some of the Republican leaders have done their best to prevent this issue from coming to the floor, despite the fact that a bipartisan majority of the House wants this vote. And they are still trying to kill reform with poison pill amendments and substitute bills. I hope that does not succeed. I hope the bipartisan majority for good campaign reform prevails.This is a very simple issue. A vote for Shays-Meehan today is the best way and, in my view, the only way to begin to roll back the influence of wealthy special interests in government. It is the only way to focus the Congress back to the issues that the people I represent care about; to make our politics more responsive to their needs and not simply listening to wealthy special interests.We have all seen what being bound to big money from special interests has done to our present legislative agenda. Republican leaders put the needs of powerful lobbyists ahead of average families and their needs. They killed gun safety legislation. They have tried to block a real patients' bill of rights, and they have refused to take action to make prescription drugs affordable to every senior.Instead, they have introduced a tax bill which gives a small minority of wealthy Americans and corporations an $8 billion tax break which threatens the economic growth that is the best I have seen in my lifetime. We have gone from a government by the people, for the people to a government of lobbyists and special interests.By passing Shays-Meehan we take the first major step toward restoring the trust of the people in their government, in their House of Representatives, and returning us all to the agenda of ordinary American families.It is time to begin this process. It is time for Shays-Meehan to be the law of the land. I ask every Member, Republican and Democratic, refuse to vote for the amendments designed to kill this reform, reject the Thomas substitute, which will only distract us from what we are supposed to be doing, and stand up today for Shays-Meehan, for real campaign reform. Return the people's Houses to the people of this great country.,2015-03-17 19:11:49.352919,2015-03-17 19:11:49.352919,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 417, BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 1999,1999-09-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-09-14/html/CREC-1999-09-14-pt1-PgH8178.htm,119,57,145,H8178-H8187,G000132,mr. gephardt
2932,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, we said a little while ago that this bill is obfuscating the real issue. This bill is about the uninsured. Let us look at the 44 million people who some believe are obfuscating the real issue.Three-quarters of those people work for small businesses. One out of every six Americans is uninsured. Eleven million kids in the United States are uninsured. As I said, three-quarters of these people either own small businesses or work in small businesses or are dependents of people who own or work in small businesses.What does it mean to be uninsured in America today? It means you face the risk of illness without the shield of health insurance. You gamble that you are not going to get sick. We have 44 million people running that gamble every day, and a lot of them lose.Linda Welch-Green has lost. Her story was reported in the Baltimore Sun today. Three of her teeth have fallen out because she cannot afford to go to the dentist anymore. She has Bell's palsy that has paralyzed part of her face. She cannot get it treated. The reason is she works, she works full-time, and her employer offers health insurance, but it is so expensive for small employers that she cannot afford the buy-in, so she uses her money to pay for her mortgage instead of for health care for herself.We can do something about that, Mr. Speaker, if we pass this bill. This is the only bill we are going to have a chance to consider that does anything for the uninsured, and it does a lot, the part of it that we passed out of the Committee on Education on association health plans. It is a simple thing. It allows small businesses to pool together in their trade or professional associations or farm associations, would allow farmers to do this, and when they pool together, they can buy health insurance with the same kinds of economies and efficiencies that big businesses already have.So if you work for a restaurant, instead of being part of a six-person pool or an eight-person pool, you can be part of a pool of 20,000 or 30,000 people, because you can be part of a pool of restaurants all around the country.We have had hearings on this bill year after year after year. Our estimate is that, at a minimum, and this is a conservative estimate, it will reduce the cost of health insurance to small businesses by 10 percent to 20 percent. That means 4 to 8 million of these people are going to be able to get insurance who do not have it.Yes, by the way, as the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg) said so eloquently, maybe others who now have access to one bare-boned HMO are going to have access to a whole lot more choices.It is about these people who are running this gamble every day. Many of them are losing. We can help them today. Let us help them. Let us not let politics get in the way of this. Let us vote for this bill today. We take up the second half of this health care reform later today or tomorrow. We can do this.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:49.753203,2015-03-17 19:11:49.753203,House,QUALITY CARE FOR THE UNINSURED ACT OF 1999,1999-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-06/html/CREC-1999-10-06-pt1-PgH9431-2.htm,134,36,145,H9431-H9474,T000024,mr. talent
2933,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, during the past few years, health care consumers have expressed increasing concern about the manner in which managed care plans are operating. Patients are being denied emergency care. Patients are being denied access to specialists. Patients are being denied needed drugs, and patients are being denied the ability to hold plans accountable for these coverage denials. Clearly, Mr. Chairman, this situation is intolerable, and the enactment of Federal legislation is needed to remedy it.Though several comprehensive managed plan reform bills have been introduced during this session of Congress, I first decided to cosponsor H.R. 358, the patients' bill of rights introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), because it would best deliver the comprehensive and enforceable patient protections that health care consumers demand.In addition to the patients' bill of rights, I also decided to support the compromise now before us, introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Norwood) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell). This bill retains all of the essential protections found in the patients' bill of rights. Among them are access to enforcement in State courts if an individual is injured by their health plan's actions and a fair and responsive grievance and appeals process.Despite the initial attempts by the Republican leadership in both bodies to block consideration of the patients' bill of rights, those interested in real health care reform continued to fight for its consideration. Now, with H.R. 2723, we have a reasonable compromise that can become law. I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 2723 and ``no'' votes on all three substitutes.I would like to take this opportunity to briefly discuss the bogeyman known as ERISA. I have been on the primary committee of ERISA jurisdiction, which is now known as Education and the Workforce, for over 30 years and I have watched how this statute has been repeatedly misconstrued by the courts and employers.First and foremost, ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, was enacted in 1974 to protect the pension and other employee benefits promised to workers and their families. Plain and simple, ERISA was intended to protect workers, not be used against them.ERISA was primarily directed at pension plans. It contains extensive standards that employers must comply with in order to ensure that workers receive promised benefits. With respect to health benefits, ERISA contained few standards. That was because Congress was already debating health care reform in 1974, and Congress expected to shortly enact national health care legislation. Unfortunately, that legislation never came to be.ERISA contains two key provisions that have repeatedly been misinterpreted by the courts and used to undermine the employee benefit protections of ERISA. First, although ERISA permits individuals to sue for violations of the law, ERISA only permitted individuals to seek ``appropriate equitable relief.'' The reason for this was that pension law derives from trust law and under trust law equitable relief includes money damages. Unfortunately, the initial courts that interpreted ERISA did not consider ERISA's underlying trust law basis.Second, ERISA preemption. ERISA did intend to preempt states from directly enacting laws that regulate benefit plans. But, ERISA specifically included a provision that permitted state laws that regulate insurance. Historically, health benefits have been provided through insurance companies and the states have always been the primary regulators of insurance. Unfortunately, here too, the courts misinterpreted ERISA and encroached upon traditional state authority. ERISA always intended for states to continue to be able to regulate the activities of insurance companies, which includes managed care companies.Mr. Chairman, let's make ERISA what it was intended to be--a law to protect the pension and employee benefit rights of workers and their families.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:49.988372,2015-03-17 19:11:49.988372,House,BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS MANAGED CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999,1999-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-06/html/CREC-1999-10-06-pt1-PgH9474-3.htm,134,51,145,H9474-H9502,C000488,mr. clay
2934,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, this is not a serious attempt to resolve the budget which we should be doing. It is frankly a stunt. It is another gimmick. It is another way to not address the serious issues that are before us.The Republicans say that the Republican budget does not spend Social Security. The Congressional Budget Office already says that at least $14 billion we are into Social Security under the Republican-passed appropriation bills. If we take out the unfair earned income credit proposal, it is over $20 billion that we have already gone into Social Security funds under the Republican-passed appropriation bills.The President did have tax increases in his budget, offsets, whatever we want to call them. They were within an integrated budget. That budget did not pass the House. We are operating under a budget passed by the Republicans. The Republicans say that they pledged never to raise taxes, they pledged never to spend Social Security money. It has already been done in the bills that have been passed. I am even told there are ads running in districts saying that the Democrats somehow did this.It is time to stop the stunts. It is time to stop the gimmicks. It is time to stop trying to say that we are doing something or not doing something that we are doing. We all know the budget issues. There are answers to these problems that we can reach on a bipartisan basis. There is going to be a meeting this afternoon in the White House. Maybe the beginning of that discussion can go on.What we owe the American people is honesty, what we owe the American people is a budget that saves Social Security, that puts money into Medicare which is needed, which takes care of education, which takes care of the 100,000 police that we so desperately need in every community. These are the issues that we should be addressing.If we were serious about addressing the budget, a proposal like this one on the floor today would have gone through committee, would have been related to an entire budget and would have been a part of a new budget that we would be bringing to the floor today because the budget we passed cannot be implemented in the way we thought it was going to be implemented.So let us stop the stunts. Let us stop the gimmicks. Vote against this proposal. Let us get down to work. Let us go to the White House today and sit down and see if we can work this out and make sense of it. Working in a bipartisan way and in an honest way with the American people, we ought to be able to get this done.,2015-03-17 19:11:50.265568,2015-03-17 19:11:50.265568,House,DISCRETIONARY SPENDING OFFSETS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000,1999-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-19/html/CREC-1999-10-19-pt1-PgH10204.htm,142,35,145,H10204-H10231,G000132,mr. gephardt
2935,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. Republicans on the Committee on Education and the Workforce have decided to take a giant step backward in providing for the most disadvantaged public schools and their pupils.Just 5 hours ago this body passed H.R. 2, a bill to target Federal funds to poor, disadvantaged children. That bill was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.Now, if we enact H.R. 2300 tonight, it would eviscerate the enhanced targeting and accountability provisions contained in that bipartisan bill. Despite the majority's claim to the contrary, their high-sounding Academic Achievement For All act does nothing to ensure that Federal funds will help children improve their scholastic abilities. It does nothing to support practices which are proven to raise student achievement.The bill essentially gives States billions of dollars in the form of revenue sharing without accountability for local educational providers or for protection to our most disadvantaged students. This bill permits States to use Federal funds to support private school vouchers and ignores Federal priorities for class size reduction, for teacher quality and for professional development. It creates a massive, yes a permissive, block grant where governors conceivably can spend Federal dollars on virtually anything from swimming pools, band uniforms to private school vouchers.Even though this bill is designed to please the governors at the expense of local school districts, the National Governors' Association has sharply criticized this bill's abandonment of poor children. In an October 8 letter to Congress the governors wrote, and I quote:``We governors recognize the link between the concentration of poverty and low educational achievement.In schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged children, students are less likely to achieve at higher levels. We would suggest that the Federal Government continue to concentrate Federal funds on these schools. Such support is essential, given that the Nation is truly committed to the belief that all students can achieve at higher levels. Only with a change to continue the targeting of Title I funds would the National Governors Association be able to bring bipartisan support to the legislation,'' end of the quote, Mr. Chairman, from the National Governors Association.Mr. Chairman, we need legislation that will help communities by raising academic performance through smaller class sizes, by holding schools accountable for achieving high academic standards, and by helping every school become safe and disciplined, and we need to replace dilapidated and crumbling schools.The Republican majority calls this bill Straight A's, but those closer to and more knowledgeable about the problems of our educational system see this bill as a cheap political gimmick designed to provide Republicans with 30-second sound bites at campaign time.Let us get real, Mr. Chairman. Let us address the serious issues of this Nation's educational deficiencies. Let us defeat this bill.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:11:50.508747,2015-03-17 19:11:50.508747,House,ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL ACT (STRAIGHT A's ACT),1999-10-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-21/html/CREC-1999-10-21-pt1-PgH10685-3.htm,144,24,145,H10685-H10715,C000488,mr. clay
2936,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to underscore the importance of addressing the multi-faceted issues involved in providing access to health care for all Americans. In a country of unsurpassed material resources, healthcare should be a right, not a privilege; yet, the number of uninsured and disenfranchised populations that have to limit their exposure even to basic primary health services, has reached staggering proportions. If we are to successfully turn-around this untenable situation, we must develop comprehensive, coordinated, targeted approaches that proactively address systemic health-related issues in our communities.I have recently become aware of the efforts of the Carondelet Health System (CHS) to develop a ``Community Outreach Network'' that would serve as a model for universal access to health services in multi-cultural communities. CHS, comprised of more than 50 hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home care agencies and physician groups across the United States, has a strong presence in the State of Missouri with its national headquarters located in St. Louis, and a number of institutions in my own district. Since its inception, CHS has focused on its commitment to the uninsured, disenfranchised and medically underserved members of the community. One-third of the population reached by CHS members is Hispanic, and there are a growing number of ethnic minorities who come to CHS institutions to find a home in an increasingly complex health care delivery system.Given the multicultural community that CHS serves, CHS has launched a national collaborative initiative to increase community health access; provide a comprehensive continuum of care for the uninsured; and focus on minority health status improvements. Breaking down barriers to health care by enrolling uninsured children and families in available programs; coordination and integration of community health resources on the local level, and cultural competency training for medical staff who serve diverse, multicultural communities will be key elements of the CHS Community Outreach Network.National health systems such as Carondelet, with unique expertise in reaching out to the uninsured and under-served, can play a highly beneficial role as collaborative partners with the federal government in developing models for community health access that can be replicated by others in health care community. As the Department of Health and Human Services develops its budget and Congress sets its spending priorities for Fiscal Year 2001, I would hope that attention will be paid and resources will be allocated to pilots and demonstrations that support current Administration goals to increase access to community health services. This is imperative in multi-cultural communities where language and other cultural differences present barriers to achieving community health objectives.Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Labor, HHS, Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Porter, and the Ranking Minority Member, Mr. Obey, for their commitment to insuring that access to health care for all Americans is a fundamental and basic right.I look forward to working with the Subcommittee in the upcoming session of Congress to find ways to increase support for critically needed minority health initiatives.,2015-03-17 19:11:50.740912,2015-03-17 19:11:50.740912,Extensions,HEALTH CARE FOR ALL,1999-11-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-22/html/CREC-1999-11-22-pt1-PgE2528-2.htm,166,0,145,E2528,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2937,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Thank you.Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the Financial Services and General Government division of the omnibus.I first want to commend Chairman Serrano for his efforts in crafting the bill. It has been a pleasure to work with him, and while we don't always agree, he has at least been open to listening to the minority's ideas.While I appreciate Chairman Serrano's efforts, I have got a lot of concern with the Financial Services division insofar as it is a 7 percent increase over fiscal year 2009, or $24.2 billion. This is very, very generous, and I believe that the resource requirements of the agencies funded in this bill can be met with a smaller allocation, particularly given the government's financial situation.However, with the allocation provided to Mr. Serrano, he has done a good job of allocating funding in the bill, and I am grateful for efforts to provide increases to critical programs such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Treasury Terrorism and Financial Intelligence programs, Drug Free Communities, and High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.I am also pleased that the bill provides $75 million for D.C. education programs, including $42 million to D.C. public schools. I am happy, to some extent, that the bill doesn't totally eliminate the Opportunity Scholarships program, but I must say I am very disappointed that the program is limited to students currently enrolled in the program.My own daughter teaches in the D.C. public schools, so I know firsthand how these schools are failing the city's children. I ask how we can possibly limit educational opportunities for low-income students when we know the public school system is underperforming?Another area of the bill that deeply concerns me are the controversial changes to long-standing general provisions regarding abortion and medical marijuana in the District of Columbia. We heard Mr. Tiahrt address that a little while ago.Let me then lastly discuss an issue that is not directly related to this bill but that is related to the Department of the Treasury, which is part of our bill, and it is the administration of TARP.The TARP has greatly expanded the Federal Government's reach into the private sector, not by purchasing troubled assets, as was its original purpose, but by purchasing common shares of banks, by owning large auto companies, and by subsidizing home mortgages.Today, many Democrats, including the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, are discussing using TARP funds to pay for yet another stimulus bill when the first stimulus bill has already been a failure. Unemployment is at 10 percent. Only 12 percent of the discretionary funding in the stimulus bill has been spent. Yet our friends on the other side of the aisle plan to shove through more government spending under the guise of job creation, which is going to do more harm than good, and we are going to offset it with surplus TARP funding.Well, the TARP funding was never supposed to be used again and again and again. Our national debt is $12 trillion, and the fiscal year 2010 deficit is projected to be over $1 trillion. Members are going to be asked to increase the debt limit. We cannot sustain this level of spending. TARP savings must be used for debt reduction.,2015-03-17 19:11:50.976074,2015-03-17 19:11:50.976074,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3288, CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010,2009-12-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-12-10/html/CREC-2009-12-10-pt1-PgH14462-2.htm,185,41,155,H14462-H14480,E000172,mrs. emerson
2938,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chair, as the House considers H.R. 1, the American Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act, let me express my support for the measure, which would appropriate additional funds for important rural development programs and invest in the future of the United States.As a rural Missouri Congressman and Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, I have examined our current economic crisis through the perspective of those who live in small town Missouri and through the lens of national security.The United States is the world's indispensable nation. To remain so, we must utilize all elements of national power--military, diplomatic, and economic. Should our economy fail, it will dramatically undercut America's military and diplomatic strength and make it far more difficult to properly address international challenges.To confront the recession, Congress and the President have an obligation to act boldly, yet wisely, to help avert the kind of economic downturn that could have lasting, severe consequences for the American people and for the future of our country.Our economy has been in decline since December 2007, and the downturn has accelerated in recent months. Consumer confidence and spending have fallen, businesses have shed millions of jobs, housing values have diminished, and mortgage foreclosures have risen dramatically. Economists from all political stripes warn us that without additional stimulus, deflation could sink the American economy for years to come.While Congress and the Administration have acted over the past year to battle the recession, more must be done immediately to create jobs, to stimulate consumer spending, to promote small business development, and to mitigate the housing crisis.I am pleased that the economic recovery bill being considered in the House takes important steps toward stimulating the sluggish economy.The measure would invest heavily in our national infrastructure and in the health, education, and safety of the American people; provide important tax relief for working families and for businesses; and strengthen the safety net for workers who have fallen on hard times.As someone who represents small town Missouri, I am particularly pleased that the legislation would commit plentiful resources for programs important to rural America, including rural water programs, rural highways and infrastructure projects, school modernization initiatives, Corps of Engineers projects, and Internet broadband expansion.I also am grateful that the legislation would direct additional funds toward critical military construction projects, including military health care, child care, and housing facilities. These projects are so very important to our military personnel and their families.While the economic recovery legislation is an important part of our country's effort to stimulate the economy, it should not be perceived as a silver bullet that will cure all economic ills.Congress and the Administration must continue to examine the global economic turmoil and consider additional legislative solutions to it, especially as it relates to the housing sector. I remain troubled that mortgage foreclosures have risen sharply despite new laws that encourage banks to renegotiate troubled mortgages. The housing crisis is at the heart of our recession and more must be done on this front.I urge my colleagues to support the economic rescue bill and look forward to working with the Senate to ensure the measure can be enacted swiftly.,2015-03-17 19:11:51.310312,2015-03-17 19:11:51.310312,House,AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009,2009-01-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-28/html/CREC-2009-01-28-pt1-PgH620.htm,17,49,155,H620-H743,S000465,mr. skelton
2939,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember Mr. William Gibbs a veteran of World War II who passed into glory on 19 October The youngest son of John and Maimi Gibbs, William Dale Gibbs was born on 21 June 1926 in Salem, Missouri, in the heart of the Ozarks. Like many in those years, Mr. Gibbs' parent found work hard to come by and eventually moved the family to St. Louis to find employment.At the age 18, with World War II still raging, Mr. Gibbs enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, 325th Glider Regiment. The 82nd was the Army's first Airborne Division. Mr. Gibbs and his unit played a lead role in blunting the German advance during the Battle of the Bulge. He and his unit saw heavy fighting, suffering heavy casualties, throughout World War II.Mr. Gibbs saw and experienced many things during his service in Europe, but none seemed to impact him as much as the following . . .``. . . Upon completion of their objectives, the division moved again towards the Rhine River and Cologne. From there, the order of duty was to push forward into the Rhineland, and then moved again towards Berlin, winding up in a town called Ludwigslust. Here they captured a concentration camp (Camp Wobbelin) which held several thousand prisoners, many were already dead and the remaining were in very poor condition. The survivors were so elated, they were out of control. Their weak mental conditions coupled with the language barrier made it very difficult to administer to their needs. Out of respect for the prisoners, General [James ``Jumpin' Jim''] Gavin ordered a proper burial of the dead prisoners in the center of town. A formal memorial and burial service was conducted by the 325th division Chaplin, Major [George B.] Wood. The German townspeople were forced to dig the graves and attend the service. There were approximately 10,000 Germans in attendance.After the encounter at Concentration Camp Wobbelin, the unit moved ahead towards the Elbe River. They had great pleasure in liberating some POW camps along the way. The soldiers were reunited with some of the 82nd Airborne Division who had been POWs captured in Italy over a year before.''According to his son, David, Mr. Gibbs retold this story many times over his life. It was during his earliest memory of this story that David first saw his father cry.Like so many of his generation, at the end of the war, Mr. Gibbs returned home, married and went to work. After completing his education and finding employment with International Shoe Company, he married Shirley Mae Warfel and together they raised a family of three boys and a girl--though they experienced the loss of their first born to leukemia at age five.The passing of William Dale Gibbs reminds me that all too soon we will lose the World War II generation to history. While we may be losing them, we should not lose their stories and the lessons they teach; one of which is there are, in fact, things for which we should fight, and if necessary, die to preserve and protect.On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you Mr. Gibbs for your service and sacrifice in Europe; and for returning home and raising sons and a daughter who were so very proud to call you ``Dad''.,2015-03-17 19:11:51.517459,2015-03-17 19:11:51.517459,Extensions,HONORING MR.

2940,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify my position on H.R. 1254, the Synthetic Drug Control Act.My vote in support of H.R. 1254 is not without reservations. I support this legislation because the health and safety of our citizens is my primary concern. This legislation will protect our communities, and particularly our youth, from more than forty new and dangerous synthetic drugs. These substances have been the cause of violent incidents and numerous deaths around the nation and it is preferable to immediately list them as Schedule I as opposed to allowing them to continue to be abused in our communities.Criminalizing these substances, however, will not solve the root problem of drug abuse in our communities. I have serious concerns about the over-criminalization of drugs. Mandatory minimum sentences lead to over-capacity criminal justice and prison systems at significant burden to taxpayers. I have long advocated for a comprehensive approach to drug abuse treatment, including education, prevention, treatment, research, and enforcement. In fact, I have authored legislation to expand accessible treatment, especially for underserved communities, and research into cutting edge treatment therapies. Responsible law enforcement is just the way to address this issue, and it must be executed in conjunction with a robust and multifaceted approach that targets the root of drug abuse problems.I also have concerns about the impact of penalties in H.R. 1254 on our scientific research processes. While, it is regrettable that H.R. 1254 circumvents the process for listing drugs as laid out in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), it is necessary in this circumstance. The evidentiary procedure in CSA has worked well for determining the listing of new substances. Unfortunately, it can be time-intensive and the law enforcement community, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Department of Justice, supports the immediate listing of these synthetic drugs because of the harm they inflict on our communities. This bill increases the length of time that a new substance can be temporarily scheduled by the DEA, thereby allowing more time for the usual CSA listing process to be carried out.Throughout my career I have supported scientific research. The study of synthetic drugs is important for understanding their impact on health and their potential beneficial uses. Unfortunately, most of the substances included in this legislation have not been subjected to extensive scientific study, and I am concerned that listing them as Schedule I drugs may inhibit the study of these drugs. While the DEA has a procedure for scientists to study Schedule I controlled substances, it presents greater barriers for scientists to work with these drugs. As of October 4, 2011, the DEA has 325 researchers conducting research with Schedule I controlled substances. These researchers include research centers and universities who seek to better understand the effects of Schedule I controlled substances. Additionally, as of October 4, 2011, the DEA has 3,983 active registrants who manufacture, research, and conduct chemical analysis with Schedule I controlled substances. I encourage the scientific community to continue their efforts to understand these and other drugs.,2015-03-17 19:11:51.675576,2015-03-17 19:11:51.675576,Extensions,SYNTHETIC DRUG CONTROL ACT OF 2011,2011-12-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-12/html/CREC-2011-12-12-pt1-PgE2224-3.htm,190,0,157,E2224-E2225,C001060,mr. carnahan
2941,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague and mentor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and to celebrate her legacy as the longest serving woman in Congress. For over 35 years, Senator Mikulski has proudly served the people of Maryland as a tireless advocate and a selfless public servant. It is my privilege to honor her today.The great-granddaughter of Polish immigrants, Senator Mikulski grew up appreciating the value of hard work and service. On the weekends she worked in her parents' East Baltimore grocery store delivering groceries to homebound elderly. It was then that Barbara developed her deep passion for helping others.After earning her master's degree in social work from the University of Maryland, Barbara started a career as a social worker with Catholic Charities and Baltimore's Department of Social Services. An outspoken advocate for at-risk youth and the elderly, she quickly earned a reputation as a fighter and was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1971. After 5 years on the city council, Barbara ran for Congress.In 1976, Barbara began her first term representing Maryland's Third Congressional District. As one of only 18 women in the House of Representatives, Barbara was a member of a small but mighty group. During her 10 years in the House, she gained a reputation as a fighter, and in 1986 the people of Maryland again chose her to represent them but this time in the Senate.As one of only two female Senators, and the first woman elected to the Senate in her own right, Senator Mikulski was met with much skepticism. While outnumbered, Barbara's determination and dedication to her constituents shined through. Barbara is a steadfast proponent of greater access to higher education, a leader on the front of women's health, and an unwavering supporter of America's veterans. She is determined to stand up for those who are often forgotten.A few weeks ago, Barbara shared a touching story that I think exemplifies her character.When Barbara first ran for Senate in 1986, she had the opportunity to get to know Harriet Woods, who was campaigning as a Democrat for the Missouri Senate seat. Barbara saw the significance of having two female candidates for Senate, and she was certain both of them would win. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be for Harriet Woods, who lost to Republican John Danforth. On Barbara's first day she was shown her desk on the Senate floor--she opened it and saw Harry Truman's autograph. She had Harry Truman's desk. While she was delighted to have that desk, she knew that it really belonged to the Senator from Missouri and relinquished it. She said that for years she thought about that desk and hoped that it would someday be returned to a Democrat from Missouri.Twenty years later, on election night in 2006, Barbara watched the election results come in from around the country--and in Missouri, in particular. She said she stayed up late in the night waiting for the final result. Once she learned of the results from Missouri, she knew that the desk that had been accidentally given to her all of those years ago would finally be returned, where it belonged. I am so pleased to know that the Truman desk was shared, if only briefly, with my friend Barbara Mikulski.Barbara Mikulski is a trailblazer, a role model, and an advisor to the other women in the Senate. Today there are 17 women in the Senate, and much of that progress can be attributed to Senator Mikulski's leadership.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating Senator Mikulski on this milestone and thank her for her 35 years of leadership, friendship, and service.,2015-03-17 19:11:51.884720,2015-03-17 19:11:51.884720,Senate,TRIBUTES TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI,2012-03-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-03-29/html/CREC-2012-03-29-pt1-PgS2226.htm,52,5,158,S2226-S2229,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2942,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I acknowledge my colleague, Senator Sessions from Alabama, and welcome the opportunity to join him in an attempt to restore some sanity in Congress about spending.I come from a State where there is a requirement of a balanced budget, although, over the last couple years, I am not sure how they would have done that without incredible pain if it hadn't been for the help the Federal Government sent them. There is no question that the fact that we don't have to balance the budget in Washington has led to some very bad habits.I was thinking about spending over the weekend, as this week there are a number of provisions we will debate that I have sponsored or am a big supporter of, including the fiscal task force amendment which went down this morning by a narrow vote, and obviously pay-go, which I have been the lead Senate sponsor on over the last several months. These are all things with which we are trying to fight something that you encounter all the time as a parent. How much easier it is to say yes than no. My kids hate when I give them that lecture because they are always wanting me to say yes. I always say the easiest thing to do is to say yes--yes, you can have that outfit; yes, you can take my car; yes, you can go see your friends, even though I am not sure you finished whatever chores you had around the house. It is always easier to say I will go along with it, it is a good cause.That is what happens around here. It is not like we are spending on evil stuff. We are spending on stuff we believe in--education, highways, our parks, our military--and we are spending on things that make it even harder to say no.The time has come that we all have to feel the pain of saying no. We all have to be willing to suffer the political consequences of saying no. That is why this amendment is such an important step in the right direction.I want to be honest about this because we have a tendency to make things bigger than they are. This isn't going to make a dramatic change in the deficit or the debt. I am not sure how many Americans have focused on the difference between the two, but they are two different things, and it will not make a huge difference. People need to remember that if we took out all discretionary spending and decided we were not going to spend another dime on education, highways or any of the things we decide on spending every year, we will still have a massive deficit problem. We don't fix the deficit by passing this amendment. We don't fix the deficit by saying we are not going to even do discretionary domestic spending anymore. So this is not a fix-all. Do you know what it does? It begins to get us well. It is a little like earmarking. Is earmarking the huge problem? No. But it is similar to a fever; it is a symptom of a disease. This will help us get well.It will be a step toward recovery if we can pass this amendment to freeze our discretionary spending. I am so pleased the White House has called for a freeze. I think this is a wonderful bipartisan moment. I think we are all hankering for a good bipartisan moment right now. I hope we are all hankering for a good bipartisan moment. I got worried this morning on the vote on the fiscal task force because it seemed like there might have been some political games being played. I don't know about anybody else, but I am hankering for a good bipartisan moment. This ought to be one, where Republicans and Democrats set aside who looks good and who looks bad, who gets credit and who gets the blame, and do something we need to do.We used to have a freeze and we used to have pay-go. They were both allowed to expire in 2002. I wasn't here. I am not sure why they were allowed to expire. Did Congress all of a sudden think we don't need pay-go anymore or we don't need limits on discretionary spending anymore because we are out of the woods when it comes to the deficit or debt? I am not sure why that happened. I know most of the folks who let those things expire wish they could take it back. I bet most of the folks who did voting for major entitlement programs without paying for them during that time--I bet they wish they could take it back because now we are in a real mess.The first and most important step to get out of this mess is to vote to control our spending. I am hopeful this will be passed by a wide margin. Some of my friends on the left have said the last thing in the world we should do now is limit spending, that government is the answer in this difficult recession. I voted for the stimulus, and I think the tax cuts in the stimulus, which don't get talked about enough, and the help to the States, which doesn't get talked about enough, and the jobs that will be created this year are very important to the progress we have made in terms of climbing out of the economic hole we found ourselves in a year ago.But we will not get out of this recession on the back of government spending. If we decide it is just about government spending during this recession, we are dealing a very bad hand to our grandchildren.I hope this amendment passes. I hope it is not even controversial. I am so pleased the President is on board, and I am pleased that so many members of the Republican party are on board. Let's take this important step, and then let's live up to it during the appropriations process. Let's realize that pet project at home that we know we can get because we can get an earmark--maybe this is the year to say no and push back from the table and say all those pet projects, those earmarks, are not the right signal we need to send to the American people this year.I thank my colleague from Alabama and Senator Kyl, who were cosponsors on this. I look forward to wide bipartisan support. I look forward to enthusiastic applause tomorrow night in the President's State of the Union Address, when he lays out his freeze on spending. We are all on board now. Let's make it happen.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:52.127892,2015-03-17 19:11:52.127892,Senate,INCREASING THE STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE PUBLIC DEBT--Continued,2010-01-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-01-26/html/CREC-2010-01-26-pt1-PgS223-2.htm,10,16,156,S223-S246,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2943,MO,Todd,Akin,R,"Mr. Speaker, in anticipation of National Philanthropy Day, I rise to draw attention to the generosity of the American people and the organizations that work to give hope and help to so many in our country. National Philanthropy Day is recognized by the Association of Fundraising Professionals on November 15.More specifically, I rise today in recognition of the many Missourians who give selflessly of their time, talent and finances to assist neighbors in need as well as victims of poverty, natural disaster and conflict. I commend the good work of the volunteers and staff of non-profit organizations and the financial donors who underwrite their efforts.According to a study by the U.S. Department of Labor and Purdue University, more than 30 percent of Missourians volunteered their time in 2003. The paid staff of charitable organizations should be commended highly for their good work. However, most would agree that they simply could not do what they do without the hearts, minds and hands of dedicated volunteers.So, today, I recognize not only the organizations but the people who brighten the days of those in need. It was Theodore Roosevelt who charged all of our fellow citizens to ``Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.'' Many of my constituents in the St. Louis area are doing just that.Following is a small sampling of the numerous charitable organizations doing great things in and around Missouri's Second Congressional District. Each of these charities has distinguished itself in a variety of ways and should be commended for its good work in the St. Louis area.

2944,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Moberly, Missouri celebrated its annual Omar Bradley Day. This day is an opportunity for area residents to remember a great hero and reflect on General Bradley's role in preserving the freedoms we hold dear.As such, I wish to enter the following article, ``Who Is Omar Bradley and Why Should I Care?'' into the Congressional Record. Written by Moberly resident Sam Richardson, this item appeared in the Sunday, May 11, 2003 edition of the Moberly Monitor-Index. I believe the points it makes are a fitting tribute to General Bradley.Here's a good topic to toss around over your dinner tonight: ``Who is Omar Bradley and why should I care?'' It's a fair question around these parts, what with the annual General Omar Nelson Bradley Luncheon, Lecture and Symposium coming up Monday, May 12, at the Municipal Auditorium in Moberly. ``What did old Omar Bradley do to cause a whole lot of people to come to his hometown 22 years after he died?'' Another more than fair question. The stock answer is that he is Missouri's most famous military figure, a member of the Missouri Hall of Fame, a guy with a 34-cent stamp with his picture on it, the fellow captured in bronze in the soaring statue in Rothwell Park, the ``Bradley'' who is the namesake for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle so prominent in last month's Operation Iraqi Freedom. Moberly public schools, St. Pius X School, Moberly Area Community College, the University of Missouri, Truman State University and other educational institutions in Bradley's home state may teach young Missourians why Omar Bradley is important to them. And, indeed, he is important to them. Of course, young and old alike should know Bradley went from Moberly High School to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and eventually commanded the largest American fighting force ever assembled, was our nation's last five-star general officer and first Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff. At the 2002 Bradley Symposium, LTC Jay Carafano, then editor at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C., told the audience one of the key reasons Bradley was not high on the public awareness screen was because of his low profile on the silver screen. Hollywood's big films about World War II didn't have much of a role for Bradley. LTC Carafano noted Bradley was on screen in ``Patton,'' ``The Longest Day'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' only briefly, hardly a leading character. At this year's Bradley Symposium, two of the Truman Presidential Library's leading historians will make the point that Bradley was a pillar of leadership in his time. Tom Heuertz, associate education coordinator, and Ray Geselbracht, education and academic outreach coordinator, at the great Independence museum will try to explain how highly Bradley was esteemed by President Harry S. Truman. ``Truman saw him as one of the world's greatest generals ever, in the same class with Hannibal and Napoleon,'' Heuertz said yesterday. Because of the positions he held, Bradley clearly was a favorite of at least three Presidents: Franklin Roosevelt, Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. On a recent edition of ``The Newshour with Jim Lehrer,'' Lucian Truscott IV, a noted military history author, reflecting on American generals' leadership in Operation Iraqi Freedom, suggested the U.S. Central Command's Gen. Tommy Franks and others were nowhere near the class of ``great generals like Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower.'' Monday, Colonel Jon H. Moilanen, dean of students and administration at the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College in Leavenworth, Kansas, will describe how Bradley's military expertise still molds the careers of young officers who serve throughout the world today. This is pretty heady stuff for a chap from our town. In a story about Bradley Day in The Washington Times recently, Moberly was referred to as ``quaint'' and ``picturesque.'' For his part, Bradley was, indeed, quiet, modest and unselfish, along with very smart, a natural leader and an exceptional athlete. The kind of man you'd expect to come from a quaint and picturesque town like ours. In the 1915 West Point class yearbook, it is reported Bradley was a sergeant, first sergeant and lieutenant; he was a sharpshooter; he was a member of the football team and track squad; and, perhaps most importantly to him at the time, he was the star of the Army baseball team all four years he was there. The yearbook says, ``His greatest passion is baseball, football and F Company. In baseball, many an opposing player has trifled once with Brad's throwing arm, but never twice. And a batting average of .383 is never to be sneezed at.'' ``His most prominent characteristic is 'getting there,' and if he keeps up the clip he's started, some of us will some day be bragging to our grandchildren that, 'sure, General Bradley was a classmate of mine,''' the yearbook says of our favorite son. And, in the style of the day, the yearbook assigned each cadet a motto. Bradley's: ``True merit is like a river, the deeper it is, the less noise it makes,'' attributed to Anonymous. How true that turned out. Although his classmate Eisenhower became Supreme Allied Commander in World War II, and then President, Bradley was the first in his class to become a brigadier general. One reporter wrote in May 1944, ``Endowed with the mind of a mathematician and the body of an athlete, General Bradley is essentially American in ancestry, training and experience; he is slow spoken but sharp witted; he is polite and at times even diffident, but immensely certain of his own skill--the type of soldier who for 168 years has sustained the republic.'' And finally, this former captain of the Moberly High School baseball team, a boy worthy of his own shotgun at age 13, a young man who graduated 44th in a class of 164 at West Point, would tell a reporter about dinner at his humble home in Randolph County: ``We'd sit down at the supper table, my mother, my dad and I, and we'd talk things over. That's where I learned a lot about love of country and right from wrong.'' From a dinner table in Randolph County to the greatness of the world, that was the man who will be remembered Monday at the 2003 General Omar Bradley Luncheon, Lecture and Symposium.,2015-03-17 19:11:52.509169,2015-03-17 19:11:52.509169,Extensions,OMAR BRADLEY DAY,2003-06-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-06-05/html/CREC-2003-06-05-pt1-PgE1157.htm,82,0,149,E1157,H000948,mr. hulshof
2945,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pension Opportunities for Women's Equality in Retirement (POWER) Act of 2000. This legislation is important because the current tax code often fails to give women--especially women who take time off to raise children--sufficient opportunities to earn a large enough pension to guarantee their financial security in retirement.The facts demonstrate that women need help in building pensions for their future. In America today, two-thirds of women over 65 have no pension other than Social Security. This translates into 300,000 women in my home state of Missouri and 14 million women nationwide. At the same time, the median income from assets for women age 65 and over is only $860 a year. Retirement is often compared to a three-legged stool, with the three legs being pensions, savings, and Social Security. Now, everyone knows what happens to a three legged stool when one of the legs is missing: it falls over. But these statistics shows that many, too many, American women are trying to manage their retirements on only one leg of the stool.As a result of the lack of pensions and relatively low savings among American women, older women are twice as likely as older men to be living near or below the federal poverty threshold. Further, the poverty rates for widows, divorced women, and never-married women are significantly higher than the rate for all elderly women. The 20 million elderly American women--including 440,000 in Missouri--carry an extremely high risk of poverty.The causes for this risk can be found in the tax code and pension rules. One of the key elements of pension building is called vesting. Employees cannot build pension assets until they vest, or serve at a particular job for a redetermined amount of time, often 5 years. Employers have a perfectly good reason for vesting requirements--they want to encourage job stability--and there is no inherent bias in these requirements. But the effect of these requirements is to make it harder for women to build up pension assets. The reason for this is that the median job tenure for women is 3.8 years, well below the median job tenure for men, as well as the 5 years most pension plans require for vesting.Another problem women face is that 59 percent of women have not figured out how much they need to save for retirement. When workers, men and women alike, are younger, they are frequently not thinking of how much they need to save for retirement. Younger workers are concerned with mortgages, school loans, children's needs. When these workers get older, and start thinking about retirement, they often increase the amount of money they will put away for retirement. Unfortunately women, who have often spent less time in the workplace, have less time in which to make the required `catch-up' contributions that will help create a stable and secure retirement. This process is made even harder by existing rules that limit the amounts of the catch-up contributions.Given the difficulties women, especially unmarried women, face in their retirement years, I believe that it is time for the Congress to step up and to ensure that retirement security law provides for higher contribution limits for working women, easier catch-up to make up for years women missed in the labor force, and increased portability of pensions.The POWER Act of 2000 will do three major things: First, the bill will increase contribution limits, allowing workers to contribute more money to retirement accounts during their working years, thereby ensuring that their retirements will be more secure.For workers who are over fifty, the bill allows additional pension contributions of up to 50 percent more than allowed under current law. This provision is particularly helpful to women who leave the labor force to raise their children, and then want to ``catch-up'' when they are older by increasing their contributions in the years leading up to retirement. This bill also requires employers to vest employees earlier, so that women, who have shorter average job tenures, can accrue pension benefits earlier.The bill's third section eases portability of pensions among workers who switch jobs. The bill eases rollovers and requires that rollovers apply to all retirement plans. In addition, the bill extends pension rollovers to include post-tax as well as pre-tax distributions, and calls for the post-tax distributions to be accounted for separately.These provisions are not controversial. They have all passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives as part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act. President Clinton vetoed that earlier bill. I disagree with the President, but he is entitled to his opinion. On these provisions, however, it is impossible to claim that these female-friendly provisions will cost too much money. The provisions in this bill will help all workers save more for retirement, and develop larger pensions for their golden years.This bill will particularly help women, who face a much greater risk of poverty. While the POWER Act will help both women and men save for retirement, it will correct specific pension inequalities in the current law that particularly hurt women. Missouri's nearly 900,000 working women certainly will benefit through enhanced opportunities to create financial security for retirement. In Missouri, 65 percent of working age women are in the paid labor force. According to the Missouri Women's Council, only 26 percent of older women receive a pension, compared with 47 percent of men. In addition, the pensions that women do receive are significantly less than those of men--$4,200 for women, on average, compared with $7,800 for men. By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:S. 2672. A bill to provide for the conveyance of various reclamation projects to local water authorities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today which will provide for the transfer of the Sugar Pine Dam and Reservoir Project in the Central Valley Project to the Forest Hills Public Utility District. I continue to support the transfer of the Bureau of Reclamation projects to the local water districts which operate and benefit from them.This bill is important in one other way. The language in this bill will correct the financial inequity that affects CVP beneficiaries. Some of the costs of constructing Bureau of Reclamation projects have been allocated to other CVP contractors even though the projects have never been operationally integrated into the CVP. Thus, Irrigation and Municipal and Industrial (M&amp;I) contractors such as Contra Costa Water District, East Bay MUD, Santa Clara Valley Water District, Sacramento MUD, City of Fresno and a number of others have incurred substantial costs without ever receiving any benefit. By Mr. REID:S. 2673. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain land to Eureka County, Nevada, for continued use as cemeteries, to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Eureka County Cemetery Conveyance Act.The settlement of Beowawe, Nevada was destination and home to pioneers that settled the isolated high desert of the central Great Basin. The inhabitants of this community set aside a specific community cemetery to provide the final resting place for friends and family who passed away. The early settlers established and managed the cemetery in the late 1800's. The Beowawe cemetery is on land currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The site of these historic cemetery was established prior to the creation of the BLM as an agency. The BLM was created in 1946. Under current law, the agency must sell the encumbered land at fair market value to this community. My bill provides for conveyance of this cemetery to Eureka County, at no cost. It is unconscionable to me that this community would have to buy their ancestors back from the Federal government.I sincerely hope that members of Congress recognize the benefit to the local community that the conveyances would provide and pass this legislation.I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,Congress finds that-- (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Maiden's Grave Cemetery'' in Beowawe, Nevada, predates incorporation of the land on which the cemetery is situated within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management; and (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the permitting process of the Federal agency. By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. DeWine):S. 2674. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code to provide for realignment of the Department of Defense workforce; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.the department of defense civilian workforce realignment act of 2000Mr. President, the Federal Government is facing a little-known, yet serious problem that jeopardizes its ability to provide services to the American people--a crisis in human capital. The federal workforce has endured years of downsizing, hiring freezes, and inadequate investment in the dedicated men and women who comprise the federal civil service. As a result, the Federal Government is ill-equipped to compete with the private sector for a new generation of technology-savvy workers to replace the nearly 900,000 ``baby boomers'' who will be eligible for retirement from the civil service in the next 5 years.To meet that challenge, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, that will help one critical department of our Federal Government--the Department of Defense--get a head start in addressing its future workforce needs. Our bill, the ``Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act of 2000,'' provides the Department of Defense with greater flexibility to adequately manage its civilian workforce and align its human capital to meet the demands of the post-cold-war environment.During the last decade, the Department of Defense underwent a massive civilian workforce downsizing program that saw a cut of more than 280,000 positions. In addition, the Defense Department--like other federal departments--was subject to hiring restrictions. Taken together, these two factors have inhibited the development of mid-level career, civilian professionals; the men and women who serve a vital role in the management and development of our nation's military. The extent of this problem is exhibited in the fact that right now, the Department is seriously understaffed in certain key occupations, such as computer experts and foreign language specialists. The lack of such professionals has the potential to affect the Defense Department's ability to respond effectively and rapidly to military threats to our nation.The need to address the pending human capital crisis in the federal workforce is increasingly apparent, as more and more leaders acknowledge that our past policies did not consider future federal workforce needs. Indeed, in testimony before the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee, which I chair, the head of the General Accounting Office, Comptroller General David Walker, stated, ``(I)n cutting back on the hiring of new staff in order to reduce the number of their employees, agencies also reduced the influx of new people with the new competencies needed to sustain excellence.''The bill that Senator DeWine and I are introducing today will help respond to these concerns by giving the Department of Defense the assistance it needs to shape the ``skills mix'' of the current workforce in order to address shortfalls brought about by years of downsizing. Our bill will also help the Department meet its needs for new skills in emerging technological and professional areas.Another area of concern for the Department of Defense--as well as many other federal agencies--is the serious demographic challenges that exist in its workforce. The average Defense Department employee is 45 years old, and more than a third of the Department's workforce is age 51 or older. In the Department of the Air Force, for example, 45 percent of the workforce will be eligible for either regular retirement or early retirement by 2005.Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH, is an excellent example of the demographic challenge facing military installations across the country. Wright-Patterson is the headquarters of the Air Force Materiel Command, and employs 22,700 civilian federal workers. By 2005, 60 percent of the Base's civilian workforce will be eligible for either regular retirement or early retirement. Although a mass exodus of all retirement-eligible employees is not anticipated, there is a genuine concern that a significant portion of the Wright-Patterson civilian workforce, including hundreds of key leaders and employees with crucial expertise, could decide to retire, leaving the remaining workforce without experienced leadership and absent essential institutional knowledge.This combination of factors poses a serious challenge to the long-term effectiveness of the civilian component of the Defense Department, and by implication, the national security of the United States.Military base leaders, and indeed the entire Defense establishment, need to be given the flexibility to hire new employees so they can begin to develop another generation of civilian leaders and employees who will be able to provide critical support to our men and women in uniform.That is the purpose of the legislation we are introducing today. The Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act addresses the current imbalance between the federal workforce and the skills needed to run the Federal Government in the 21st century, as well as the age imbalance between new employees and the potential mass retirement of senior public employees in the next 5 years. If we wait for this ``retirement bubble'' to burst before we begin to hire new employees, then not only will we be woefully understaffed in a number of key areas, but we will have fewer seasoned individuals left in the federal workforce who can provide training and mentoring.The provisions in our bill will allow the Defense Department to conduct a smoother transition by bringing new employees into the Department over the next 5 years. The new employees will have the opportunity to work with and learn from their more experienced colleagues, and invaluable institutional knowledge will be passed along.While this proposal does not address all of the human capital needs of the Defense Department, it will help ensure that the Department of Defense recruits and retains a quality civilian workforce so that our Armed Forces may remain the best in the world. It is extremely important to the future vitality of the Department's civilian workforce and the national security of the United States that we address the human capital crisis while we have the opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in full in the Record.

2946,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, continuing the tradition that we have tried to begin as newly elected Republican Members focusing on positive success stories across the district, as you know just as our Nation's children are returning to schools all across this great land, we lawmakers are returning here to Washington and I think probably sharing some of the mixed emotions that our schoolchildren have as far as returning here to this establishment.What we do here, of course, is very important with the bills and the debates and our struggles here. But I think what we do pales in comparison to the real life struggles that our constituents, the American people, are facing each and every day.We talk about this 4-week period of time here in August, or just as August past, as a recess or a vacation. And I know many of the newly elected Members did not consider it as a vacation, as a recess. It was a very good time to get back home to really probe the minds and listen. And I think if anything that we have been able to accomplish that has been the most fruitful is that we stop shouting long enough in this body to listen to what the American people have to say.And when we began to listen to those men and women that have been struggling to keep a roof overhead and keep food on the table, what we heard them tell us is that they were working longer and harder and yet had less to show for it at the end of the month and wondering where their tax monies had gone.Basically what I was hearing, in a series of town hall meetings, was that the people back home in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District wanted us to change our ways here in Washington so that they would not have to change their ways back home.I know certainly that there has been a wide difference of opinion on the budget agreement that we put together. Certainly future political candidates, I was flipping around the channels and watching C-SPAN and some of the speeches where future politicians or those seeking higher office have talked about what we did in a negative way. Yet I did not sense that at all. A series of town meetings in the Ninth Congressional District of Missouri were overwhelmingly positive.The folks that came out recognized that we were on the path to a smaller, smarter government. They were appreciative of the fact that the centerpiece of our budget agreement, the tax relief package, was a child credit that will benefit the parents of 41 million children across this country, and the fact that nearly 2 million households will not have a Federal income tax liability just because of this $500 child credit.They were appreciative of the child health initiative that we have commenced, that we put together in this budget plan to help the Nation's most vulnerable that are uninsured. And I tried to explain and made clear that this was not a new Federal entitlement that we had imposed but a way to reach out with local innovative solutions to this national problem of uninsured children.They were certainly appreciative, as education is very much on the minds of the folks in the Ninth Congressional District, that we have education tuition credits that we are putting in place so that children that dream of college can actually get there, and those that have been laboring under the weight of a student loan might have a little bit of his or her burden eased by allowing the deduction of interest on that student loan.Certainly we recognize that a strong economy is vital because as we help educate and invest in our children, the future of this country, we have to make sure that there are jobs available. And clearly people recognize that we do not create jobs here in Washington; it is the American people, it is the business people, it is small business across this country that creates the jobs. And so clearly we want to make sure that every investor, every inventor, every small business person, every farmer has some relief from this very burdensome tax on savings and investment that we have come to call capital gains, and they were very appreciative that we have at least taken a step in the right direction regarding a reduction on that burdensome tax.Many of the women that came to town hall meetings were astounded to learn that women in this country are starting businesses at twice the rate of men in this country. But oftentimes women have that very difficult choice, do I stay home with family or do I rejoin the work force? So we have reached out to them and all small business people that want to work from their homes by restoring the flexibility through the home office deduction; and the American people, at least those in the Ninth Congressional District, see that and applaud that as a step in the right direction.Finally, as we have talked about many times in this Chamber, I personally believe it is immoral that the Federal Government can take up to 55 percent of a family farm or family business at death. Death should not be a taxable event. Certainly we will be having future discussions about death tax relief, but we have made some positive strides by raising the exemption so that family farms and family businesses and those that labor can pass the fruits of their labors on to future generations.I know one of the polls that somebody showed me as we were leaving town 4 weeks ago indicated that Congress' approval rating was at a high level, at least the highest level since the early 1970's, and sadly our approval rating in this body was above our disapproval for the first time in several decades. And of course that is a sad event, but we need to continue to focus on our agenda that we will be bringing to the floor in the weeks and months ahead before we take our final recess for the end of the year.We have got a lot of work yet to do. But I think we need to focus a little bit on some of the success stories and some of the things that we have listened to the people across this country in our respective districts.I see I have various colleagues that are here to join me. I think first I would yield to the gentleman from South Dakota [Mr. Thune]. It is interesting that each of us has our own respective districts and I know our friend and colleague, the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. Moran], I think was one of the most ambitious and he embarked on a 60-plus county tour and made sure that he blanketed his district.But certainly we do not have quite the expanse of territory to cover as the gentleman from Montana [Mr. Hill], who is not with us, or the gentleman from South Dakota who has the entire State.Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Dakota [Mr. Thune].,2015-03-17 19:11:53.026531,2015-03-17 19:11:53.026531,House,LISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,1997-09-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-03/html/CREC-1997-09-03-pt1-PgH6765-2.htm,114,1,143,H6765-H6771,H000948,mr. hulshof
2947,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] for yielding me the time.I am reminded that, in the midst of all this heat and the very little light, and the chairman of the committee predicted it and I think he was right in doing that, we are dealing with an issue that really matters to real people, to the millions of kids and their parents in low-income neighborhoods who are trapped in schools, trapped in schools, where they do not learn and where they are not safe.The issue here, Mr. Speaker, is are we going to help these kids or are we going to sacrifice them on the alter of a system that is failing them and failing the country? Now, I say that with deep reluctance. But we cannot help these children unless we are honest about the situation. And we all know that this system is failing them.In New York, Mr. Speaker, 25 percent of New York's public school students will receive their high school diploma. The record in the parochial school system is 95 percent in New York. In Baltimore, fewer than half of the city's ninth-graders could pass a basic rudimentary math test. In Philadelphia, less than 6 percent of the city high school students tested competent in reading.Do you know what happens to you if you are in high school and you cannot read? You know what your life is going to be like? The system is so bad, Mr. Speaker, that none of us, whatever our feelings about this bill, would or do send our kids to these schools.So what does the bill propose to do? It increases the block grant money that we are giving to all the public schools and it allows them the discretion, if they wish to use it, to institute a school choice program of the kind that has succeeded in Milwaukee and Cleveland and in New York and places around the country.Why do we do that? Because this program works. The statistics show that. The waiting lists show that there are 20,000 parents waiting for 1300 privately funded scholarships in New York. And the reaction of the establishment shows it.Mr. Speaker, the reason for the hostility of this bill is not because people are afraid the bill is going to fail but because they know it is going to succeed and the better education these kids will receive will embarrass an establishment that is failing them. The arguments against the bill, I have been sitting here listening to them, one of them is that we are not helping enough kids with it. We would like to help more. I would say we are helping them all. We are giving them all some hope. We are taking money away from the public schools. No, we are not. No, we are not. We are giving them more money. And then we are letting them, if they wish, use the money for these programs.And then the argument that we are hurting public schools. Mr. Speaker, a member of the Milwaukee school board said that the school choice program there has encouraged and really forced his school system to adopt reforms that they should have adopted a long time ago. Apart from that, I have to say, with the greatest respect, it is time to stop worrying about the bureaucracy and to start worrying about these kids. The bureaucracies are doing fine. The number of employees in the Baltimore school system has doubled in the last 40 years, at the same time that math and reading skills are going down.Mr. Speaker, let us put a human face to this. One of the things that motivates me, and I have talked to a lot of these kids and their parents around the country, is an article in the New York papers about the privately funded school changes program they have there; and they refer to a little boy named Carlos Rosario, age 9, of Washington Heights. And he explains why he would like a scholarship if he can get one. He says, ``I don't like my school. The kids are too rough. They hit me and push me around.''Mr. Speaker, I have a 7-year-old boy and two other kids. And if it was my boy who came home and said that, I would do anything I could to protect him. We have an opportunity in this modest way to take a step ahead for people like Carlos Rosario and his mom. I would ask the House to drop this partisanship and these extraneous issues and support this bill.Applicants' Parents Are Sick of Fear, Violence and Bad Teachers (By Tracy Connor and Maggie Haberman)want a smaller, safer, more educational environment than the public schools provide.Single mom Shelmadine Usher of The Bronx is keeping her fingers crossed that her 6-year-old son, Timothy Moses, will get one of the coveted 1,300 spots.He attends a private school, but the financial aid that pays for it dries up when Usher graduates from community college in June.``I went to public school in The Bronx and it was bad, and I always said that when I had a child, I would make sacrifices to send him to private school, she said.``I'm ready to work two jobs if this scholarship doesn't come through.''Timothy is a quick learner and avid reader, and Usher believes that private school--with higher standards and more parental involvement--will keep him on the fast track.The greater amount of individual attention is also a plus. Luiyina Abreu, a third-grader in northern Manhattan, is floundering in math class.``I think they teach differently at private school, maybe better than at my school now,'' she said. ``It would give me a chance to do better.''Classroom safety is another big concern. ``I don't like my school. The kids are too rough. They hit me and push me around,'' said Carlos Rosario, 9, who attends PS 153 in Washington Heights.His mother, Maria Jiminez, is seeking scholarships for Carlos and his sister, Karla, 8, who emigrated from the Dominican Republic in 1993.``Public school is dangerous,'' Jiminez said. ``If you're a good parent, you teach your children how to behave at home. But then they go to school and it's a bad environment.''Jasmine Abdul-Quddus, 8, who lives in the East Village and attends PS 19, agrees. ``They fight and call people names.''Her mother, Kalima Abdul-Quddus, who moved here from Atlanta three years ago, is just as concerned about academic standards for Jasmine and her sister Aleah, 7.``In private school, the teachers are more devoted to education,'' she said. ``In public school, they just push them through.'',2015-03-17 19:11:53.355765,2015-03-17 19:11:53.355765,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,91,143,H9941-H9965,T000024,mr. talent
2948,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, on August 11, 2000, General Eric Shinseki addressed the Military Order of the World Wars in Kansas City, Missouri. I submit his speech for the Record:Congressman Skelton--thank you for that generous introduction. It's good to be here with you this evening-- thanks also for your service to our nation and the Army as the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. Your commitment to the national defense and your passion for the well-being of our men and women is legendary. We are indebted to you. Ladies and gentlemen--please join me in thanking Congressman Ike Skelton for his devotion to the soldiers, civilians, and family members of the Army. In this room this evening are also some other patriots who have been great supporters of our military and our veterans. Many have served our nation in war; among their numbers are those who have felt the sting of battle. But all have provided our communities the kind of leadership that has made this country what it is today. To the Kansas City Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars, thank you for your support of our soldiers and veterans. You know, this country enjoys a unique status in the community of nations. We are a great nation, and we enjoy a vibrant and flourishing economy. No other nation enjoys our unique status in the way that we do today. Americans enjoy these special circumstances, but many do not associate our national strength and our economic health with the readiness and professionalism of our military forces. The fact is, however, that you don't get to be a great power with the world's leading economy without also having a world class military that is respected by our allies and feared by our adversaries. Our military forces enable the great nation status enjoyed by the American people. No one understands or appreciates the importance of that link better than those who have defended this wonderful country of ours in war or those who have the responsibility of assuring the readiness of its military capabilities on a daily basis. The Military Order of the World Wars understands that linkage. Congressman Skelton understands that linkage. Both have worked to help us stay connected to the American people. They have helped us fill our ranks with the kind of youngsters who have kept our Army a force for good and an instrument of national policy. Again, we are grateful for all that you do on our behalf. Also present in the room this evening are a very special group of international fellows. They are students at Fort Leavenworth who will spend the next year at the Command and General Staff College studying with, about, and for us. Since World War I, all of the wars we have fought and most of our significant operational deployments have seen Americans serving side-by-side with soldiers from allied nations. We will never again fight on our own. Coalition and multinational operations are a fact of life. Many of the uniforms on display this evening are the ones who have shared space on distant battlefields with us. We are honored to have so many allied officers and their spouses here this evening. We know the keenness of the selection process that went on in each of your countries, we are honored to have you join us in residence at Fort Leavenworth. You add to the education of our officers. Buffalo wings. There is a lot of excitement in and about our Army today. Many of you know that we have set a course to transform this great and magnificent army of ours from its current cold war designs to a force that is more responsive, more deployable, more versatile, more agile, more lethal, more survivable, and more sustainable force for the future crises of the 21st century. Last fall as we were about to walk from 1999 into 2000 through the door of a new century and the new millennium, I went back to the turn of the last century to try to understand what the last Chief and the last Secretary to do so were thinking; what were their concerns; what decisions did they put in place to prepare their Army for all of its responsibilities in the 20th century. Secretary of War Elihu Root and General Nelson Miles recognized that the Army was standing not just on the threshold of a new century, but at the entrance to a new world. The war with Spain the year before had been just the second overseas deployment of the Army in history, and the first in over 50 years. The Army of 1899 was scattered from Cuba to Puerto Rico to the Philippines. The operating tempo was high, with soldiers maintaining peace, rebuilding nations, handling refugees, even helping with disaster relief after a hurricane. The Army was overseas and that looked like the wave of the future. So, 1899 was a pivotal time. The wars in the West were won. The purpose of the Army seemed to be changing, but in what direction? The Army had shown real growing pains when it had mobilized for war. In addition, technology was changing fast. The Army needed to rethink the future of warfare quickly. Root recognized that the Army had to grow and change as the strategic environment of his times demanded. He tried to envision what the twentieth-century Army should become. Could he foresee a world in which nuclear superpowers threatened each other and the rest of the earth with Armageddon? Could he predict a decade-long depression? Did he know that within the 50 years the world would twice be plunged into global wars, wars unprecedented in scale and scope in all the previous history of mankind? Certainly, the answer to all these questions is no. Root foresaw none of these things. As best we can tell from documents and their writings, neither of them saw the First World War and it was only 15 years away. But with insight and courage and deliberation, they developed a vision for what the Army needed to become, given the strategic and technological realities they faced at the time. They took risks and made preparations that proved to be effective--and timeless. Root began with fundamentals. He presented two principles that are as true today as when he wrote them 100 years ago: ``First. That the real object of having an army is to provide for war. ``Second. That the regular establishment in the United States will probably never be by itself the whole machine with which any war will be fought.'' Root was reaching back toward concepts that were almost as old as the nation itself. First, being ready for war means having an army, and there's no reason to have an army that is not ready for war. The Army might be called upon to do many things, but its first purpose was warfighting. And the Army would never fight alone. Root knew that the Army would need to rely on the Navy for transport, logistics, and gunfire. It would also fight with volunteers and citizen soldiers. Those first principles were right on the mark. And they have served as a foundation upon which Root and Miles and their successors built the twentieth-century Army. Root consolidated the professional gains that the Army had made through the establishment of the Army War College and the restructuring of the Army headquarters into a modern general staff. He brought to fruition the idea that military leadership was a calling, and one that demanded rigorous education and training. The officer corps that flourished under this system became the leaders who produced our victories in two world wars--wars unimaginable in 1899. The Army of the twentieth century, the nation whose freedom it guaranteed, owed a great deal to Elihu Root's vision preparation for the future. As we stood on the cusp of the new millennium 10 months ago, we saw a situation remarkably similar to the one that Root and Miles faced 100 years ago. The world has changed dramatically. The cold war was a historic anomaly. We maintained relatively robust forces for 50 years because of the danger of superpower conflict. That very preparedness deterred a war too terrible to contemplate, but one that we stood trained and ready to fight for half a century. Since 1989 we have reduced the size of the Army by 32 percent, but our operating tempo is higher than at anytime in several decades. The recent mission in Kosovo brings to 35 the number of operational mission deployments the Army has made since the end of the cold war. The world is a far less stable place than it used to be. Moreover, the world is a far different place than it was 10 years ago. In a word, it is ``wired.'' The information revolution has placed a computer on every desk. We are all cyber-connected to each other and everything imaginable around the world. We are renegotiating zones of privacy and business practices and property protections and the very idea of what a nation-state is. Many of the advertisements we see on television are for products that did not exist 15 years ago. It is impossible to predict with assurance what the world will look like in 5 or 10 or 25 years. But we know that it will continue to change and that the pace of change will continue to accelerate. We must prepare to fight our future wars. We must also be ready for the next crisis. We must be able to respond to missions throughout the spectrum of operations, from the low end of disaster relief to the high end of major war. We need to take advantage of emerging technologies to counter emerging threats. And we can't make it up as we go along--we need a plan. And so it is that last October, the Army charted its course for transforming itself into a force more capable than the magnificent force we field today. We intend that it will be a force capable of handling the full array of missions that we have been called upon to do in the last 10 years--in many ways, we have described the 1990's as the first 10 years of the 21st century in terms of the kinds of missions we see for ourselves in the years ahead. But what we will not lose sight of is what Elihu Root concluded 100 years ago--our non- negotiable contract with the American people is to be trained and ready to fight and win the nation's wars. This we will do--and just as Root and Miles could not see all the technological advances that were going to present themselves as opportunities in the 20th century, we cannot today settle on the technologies that will go into the design of the hardware that will describe the objective force we are trying to design for the 21st century. But what Root and Miles were able to do was to position their army for all The unseen opportunities that were to lay ahead by putting into place the system for training soldiers and developing leaders who were going to have to make those decisions when the time was ripe. And so it is with our responsibilities today. Much has been written over the past 10 months about the technologies that the Army will need to transform itself. The debate about combat platforms has turned hot and in some cases mean-spirited as the competition for inclusion has become intense. I have even received the concerns of allied armies about the fear of an ever-expanding technological gap between the American army and those of our closest allies. I think the lessons of Root and Miles are important---their conclusions are as important today as they were then. It isn't about technology, although technology is important; it isn't about platforms, although combat platforms is important. It is about leadership and character and doctrine. It is about the preparation of the Army to be ready to fight each and every day with the technologies it has available, and it is about the development of visionary, courageous leaders who have the skill and determination to leverage the technologies as they become apparent and embed them into the formations that will fight them. Focus on warfighting; develop the leaders for the next conflict. If you do that well, those leaders will be able to get the right technologies into place in time. But without that kind of leadership or without warfighting formations which have been disciplined to execute one's warfighting doctrine, all the technology in the world will make no difference. Warfighting is ultimately a human dimension in which the most dedicated, disciplined, and best trained will prevail. It is about leadership and in this Army, we consider it our stock in trade. To our allied officers, your attendance at Leavenworth is important for us---for the American officers attending the course and for our force as a whole. You give our officers other perspectives on our common challenges. Our differences in culture, language, nationality, and geography give us each our different outlooks on military operations. We must understand and appreciate the importance of interoperability---but not just technical and tactical interoperability but interoperability of the mind. The lessons you learn in professional give-and-takes with your fellow officers, inside the classroom and at the officers' club, will be among the most important that you take away from this course. Equally important will be the professional associations you make with your fellow students. The future battlefields will be joint and multinational and you will find yourselves serving with the officers you are studying with this year--- just as I have experienced. I can tell you that as commander of the stabilization force in Bosnia, the relationships that I had developed with my counterparts in years past, whether in operational assignments, or in the Command and General Staff College or the National War College, helped us to bridge the gaps. Personal relationships and a common professional understanding turned those differences into strengths. We, in this country, have put tremendous effort into our professional education systems. The pay-off for that investment has been a consistently high quality of officer leadership. I would also tell you that our noncommissioned officer education system is equally the finest in the world and it has produced the very finest NCO Corps in the history of our army. In the gulf war, one of the take away lessons was that our technological and materiel superiority made us successful. Those who fought the war would give you a slightly broader lesson. As one division commander proclaimed, we could have traded equipment with the Iraqis and still beat them in 100 hours. That may sound like vain boasting, but his point was that our professional education system and the professionalism of our soldiers and their leaders were the foundations of our warfighting prowess--not technology. That has always been true. In the Army we do two things every day---we train soldiers and we grow them into leaders. Some of that work happens in our operational units. Some of it happens in quiet moments when our officers and soldiers can read about their profession, its history, its methods, and its doctrine. But the foundation of it all resides in our professional schools. I'm glad that you have all come to study with us. I appreciate the value that you bring to our professional education system. I thank you for breaking bread with us tonight. And though I don't look forward to our joining ranks on a future battlefield, I do look forward to the trust and confidence that we will build together as professional soldiers. Thank you and God bless you.,2015-03-17 19:11:53.675992,2015-03-17 19:11:53.675992,Extensions,SPEECH OF GENERAL ERIC SHINSEKI,2000-09-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-13/html/CREC-2000-09-13-pt1-PgE1447-3.htm,107,0,146,E1447-E1449,S000465,mr. skelton
2949,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, on August 15, at the annual Military Order of World Wars and International Officers Ball, Admiral James O. Ellis, Jr., Commander of the United States Strategic Command, provided us with words that should be shared with all. I extend his remarks for fellow Members of Congress. I know that we can benefit from his words as we face international challenges.Congressman Skelton, a true friend and colleague in shared service to our nation over nearly three decades, Major General Shirkey, Brigadier General Hirai and fellow officers, active, retired, American and allied, Jim and Pat Snyder, who created this marvelous venue, veterans and members of the Military Order of the World Wars, other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It's truly a pleasure to be with you this evening. I cannot begin to tell you how much I have been looking forward to tonight, with its camaraderie and conversation and its symbolism and spirit. I suppose I am the senior Naval Officer for a thousand miles in any direction, and if my being honored with this opportunity tells you nothing else, it tells you how far we really have come in joint and combined operations. Congressman Skelton, thank you for your far too generous introduction. Your kind words actually remind this wonderful audience of two basic facts about me. The first is that I am old and the second is that I can't hold a job! In all seriousness, I cannot tell you how delighted I am to have a small part in this great evening. This room is filled with a military presence that, literally, spans a wealth of experience and a world of potential. The real guests of honor this evening are, of course, the military members from the seventy-two countries, resplendent in the cloth of their nations, who join their American colleagues in a year of personal promise and professional opportunity. But it is also a particular honor to be in the company of veterans from what is now referred to as America's greatest generation but who would only protest they were merely doing their duty. It is also appropriate that we remember the thousands of military professionals who have passed through the doors of Bell Hall en route to prominence in the spotlight of history or, more often, to the unlit corners of the globe and the ironically brighter glow of heroism in all its forms known only to the colleagues with whom they served. In a very real sense, they, and all of you, have brought us to this place and time in history. It is also appropriate to recognize our hosts this evening. The Military Order of World Wars has always been active in work to support men and women in uniform. Through a long and storied history of over eighty years, the Order has stood tall. Among many other achievements, the Order successfully revived the dormant Purple Heart award for service members injured in combat and successfully lobbied Congress for creation of the nation's annual Armed Forces Day observance. I'd like to particularly thank the Greater Kansas City Chapter of this fine organization for making tonight's event an annual tradition over the past 14 years. Jim and Pat Snyder have worked very hard to make this night a success, and I particularly want to thank them. They are in good company, as part Kansas City chapter alumni include former Presidents and Army veterans Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. The world has changed a great deal since these two gathered in this group. Foes have become friends, prosperity and democracy have spread underneath an international security umbrella and alliances and coalitions that no one would have dreamed of a decade and a half ago have become reality. There is cause for optimism, even in the face of today's stark realities. As Secretary Colin Powell's fourth law says: ``It CAN be done!'' Last March, Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi said ``I am convinced that the time will come when many countries keenly realize the necessity of international collaboration for world peace, stability and prosperity.'' I would add only that the time is now and the obligations are ours, together. A few years ago, I was privileged to command NATO's Allied Forces in Southern Europe during a significant period of Balkan conflict. Then, as now, I saw the value of strong alliances of like-minded nations that could, in time of crisis, find a way to both debate and act to resolve issues of international security and humanitarian crisis. It is possible to accommodate legitimate national concerns and still deal swiftly, as we must, with dictators and despots. The old saying is that ``much is asked of those to whom much is given.'' We, all of us in this room, have been given much. Now is our time to show an understanding of the obligations that come with all those wonderful opportunities. Every nation--large and small--must contribute to the common good, as the Bible says, ``each according to his means.'' Consider the words of Estonian foreign minister, Thomas Hendrik. Speaking about NATO in October 2001, he said, ``The organization as a whole can only benefit from the fact that the alliance includes members whose national security is greatly dependent on the existence of a strong, prestigious, and vital defensive union. The members and the candidate states who make up this alliance, including Estonia, are not just consumers of security, but also very important producers of security''. In other words, we're all in this together. The basics remain the same. The challenges we collectively face are not all military or political. There are opportunities to share in a host of common interests in trade, technology assistance, culture, education and athletic exchange. But none of these will be possible without collective security. Ronald Reagan once said, ``There are simple answers, there are just no easy answers.'' And the security challenges have never been more difficult as a thousand snakes have replaced a single dragon. One of the security opportunities that works best is what we are seeing here tonight--the faces of military men and women from many nations, brought together in common interest to learn, share and grow, both personally and professionally. The goal is to share strengths and different perspectives; to appreciate and enjoy different backgrounds and cultures, not to eliminate them. A bit of humor will often help. Some years ago I was posted in Bahrain as Captain of the U.S. Navy regional flagship. One day a Royal Navy frigate Captain paid a call and asked if I had heard the new joke making the rounds of the UK Admiralty. A straight man to the end, I replied, ``No.'' He said it was about the two American Naval officers whose ship was sunk, leaving them stranded on a small desert island--a mound of sand, a palm tree and just the clothes on their backs. Within two days, he said, they were working nights. . . . You can make a lot of telling points with humor! Young men and women of 72 nations are participating in the Army Command Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, this year. I have been privileged to grow old in the service of my country, service that has allowed me to personally visit 37 of the 72 nations represented here tonight and to serve with half again as many of your professional military forces. Even tonight, I cannot gaze on your uniform splendor without beginning a flashback recall of 34 years that included the skies over Vietnam, a decade in the Arabian Gulf, from Japan to the Taiwan Straits and from Italy into Macedonia, Albania and even a parachute jump into Kosovo. We shared dangers, opportunities, challenges, commitment and the occasional toast. I learned and laughed with friends from many nations, some of whom I can never forget and others whom I only dimly remember. But I treasure each experience as well as the friendship that remain to this day. And I envy each of you, because your excitement is here and now. The American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ``The only way to have a friend is to be one.'' The flags decorating this hotel ballroom represent the nations who are now friends and partners with the United States. We truly value your views and experience in this newly globalized world. Whether you come from India or Indiana, from Kazakhstan or Kansas, your participation enriches all of us. Earlier, I mentioned the presence in this room of vast military tradition and experience. Another presence in this room is a spirit of teamwork. I see it reflected in the faces of men and women from other nations who stand with us today. Together, we are the best hope for a civilized world as we face an ever-changing field of security challenges. Teamwork is the mortar for the operational bricks of our military superstructure. There is an old proverb from the Czech Republic--``Do not protect yourself by a fence, but rather by your friends.'' The nations of our alliances must stand together against those who would threaten the peace and security of our world. We must not hide in the shadows behind ever-taller barriers but rather stride confidently into the sunlight, unafraid in the company of our friends. This is our time to make a stand. This is our time to make a difference. One of the most encouraging developments I've seen over my 30-plus years of service is the growing strength of the alliances and coalition partnerships I've mentioned. Immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, DC there were many world leaders and ordinary citizens from many nations who expressed their anger at the craven acts, and support for the United States in confronting what we now know is a global scourge. One of them was British Prime Minister Tony Blair who said, ``This is not a battle between the United States of America and terrorism, but between the free and democratic world and terrorism.'' Blair said his soldiers would stand shoulder to shoulder with Americans and would not rest until evil is driven from our world. He and many others have remained true to that commitment. Just a few weeks ago, Congressman Skelton was speaking at the Truman Library as it opened a new exhibit on the Korean War. He talked about the coalition fighting the war against global terrorism and said, ``What they are doing today will set the stage for the next 50 years.'' I agree. And you all are the leaders of today and tomorrow who will get it done. The best of friends, I believe, are those who have demonstrated a resilience and resolve born of their own challenges well and truly met. Those who, perhaps in a decade or generation or over a long and storied history have shown they, as a people, have what is necessary to weather any crisis and pass any test that confronts us. That's why we look to those of you from other nations who are here tonight. The Greek warrior Thucydides said, ``We secure our friends not by accepting favors, but by doing them.'' It is my expectation that all of you embarking on this course of study will be challenged. It must be so if you are to learn. But think of the opportunities this year will bring and savor every moment. It reminds me of a story about a little girl who had been eagerly looking forward to her very first day of school. That evening, when her father came in from work, he called his daughter to him and asked her what she thought of school. She looked at her father and said, very seriously, ``I think I may have started something I can't finish.'' She was right. The serious business of learning more about others, about this world in which we live, and about our profession of arms is a process we never finish. Congressman Skelton is a strong proponent of lifelong education, both formal and informal. Indeed, I received a letter from him just last month in which he enclosed an abbreviated fifty-volume reading list he personally recommended. This is a man who practices what he preaches! He believes, as do I, in the truth of the old maxim, ``If you want a new idea, read an old book!'' When you graduate from Army Command and General Staff College, I encourage you to view your education as just the beginning or, hopefully, a continuation of what for each of you is a life-long effort to expand your horizons to include new ideas and, in so doing, deepen your understanding and appreciation of the world around you. My background is Navy, and, as such I am arguably not the most credible spokesman in support of Professional Military Education. Perhaps as a result of our deployment mentality, the U.S. Navy has come late to understand its value. I am embarrassed to admit in front of Congressman Skelton that, despite participating in a dozen Joint Task Forces, four combined operations in crisis and conflict and now leading a major Joint Combatant Command, I am not a graduate of ANY professional military courses. I am embarrassed, but it is true. I once noted that having me speak in favor of PME is about the same as making me the spokesman for the Hair Club For Men. But that is why the self-taught, home-schooled, on-the-job-trained warrior envies you the opportunity that this year offers. The value of a Professional Military Education is inestimable in today's world. It accelerates your professional life, allowing you to walk in the shoes of hundreds of others, to learn from their successes and their failures and to create the incredibly valuable capability to think. It also provides a time to consider what it means to be a professional soldier, Sailor, airman, Marine or Coastguardsman. The core values of integrity, service beyond self, and excellence in all we do are not only on-duty military values, they are lifetime values. Every one of you will gain skills as warriors, and at the same time you will enrich your lives by participating in the curriculum at Leavenworth. Those of you from other lands will enrich the American lives you touch. And when the time comes to return home or to your respective services, I hope you will take with you a renewed confidence in your own abilities to help shape a different world. For your efforts will define, in ways large and small, our future. In the affairs of nations, no outcome is pre- destined. Your presence here is the result of clear vision, decisive choice, and unwavering commitment. The future of individual nations and our alliances will be the result not of inevitability, but of sustained collective effort. It's effort we must continue to make every day, every week, every year, in defense of our shared freedom. In 1999, as his nation was joining the NATO alliance, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, ``Finding one another is a promising beginning, staying together is a process, and working together is a success.'' So, tonight I challenge those of you from around the world to work together for our shared success. Someone once said that a successful marriage is a sixty- sixty proposition. In that light I encourage each of you to strive to put more than what you think is your fair share into this upcoming year; that will, ironically ensure you get out far more than you put in. Encourage one another to gain a deeper understanding of your part of our world and ensure that when your time together is ended, you can leave with the regret that characterizes good friends parting and not the regret of tasks left undone or words left unsaid. I would close by reminding you of something that you already know, but which you must never forget, in the words of a leader from another time and another crisis. You may not know it, but my Navy family harbors a dark secret. It concerns my son, who, despite the efforts of his mother and me to raise him properly and set him on the right path, is a graduate of West Point. He would be embarrassed to hear me speak of it, but, in all seriousness, he knows how proud we are of him, now in command of Bravo Company, Second Ranger Battalion. He has recently returned from Afghanistan where for six months he shared dirt, danger and duty with UK Paras, Italian Carabinieri and soldiers, new friends from a dozen other nations. In the four years that his mother and I journeyed up the Hudson to that storied Point, I came to appreciate the words of a distinguished graduate of that school who, in a moving speech nearly four decades ago described the role of a military in a democratic society and also described a world whose concerns have not changed so much in the decades since. Perhaps the more things change, the more they stay the same. General Douglas MacArthur said: ``And throughout all this welter of change and development, your mission remains fixed, determined, inviolable. It is to win our wars. Everything else in your professional careers is but a corollary to this vital dedication . . . You are the ones who are trained to fight. ``Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of government; whether our strength is being sapped by deficit financing indulged in too long; by Federal paternalism grown too mighty; by power groups grown too arrogant; by politics grown too corrupt; by morals grown too low; by taxes grown too high. ``These great national problems are not for your professional participation or military solution. Your guidepost stands out like a tenfold beacon in the night: duty, honor, country. You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national system of defense. From your ranks come the great Captains who hold the nation's destiny in their hands the moment the war tocsin sound.'' He may have been Army, but I can't improve upon that! Thank you and have a good night.,2015-03-17 19:11:53.909158,2015-03-17 19:11:53.909158,Extensions,A SPEECH BY ADMIRAL JAMES O. ELLIS,2003-09-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-09-16/html/CREC-2003-09-16-pt1-PgE1791-3.htm,127,0,149,E1791-E1793,S000465,mr. skelton
2950,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you very much.As I said, there was a stream of thought in this country that says, we ought to begin accepting drug use as a way of life. It is known as the ``harm reduction'' school of thought. It is a philosophy that tries to limit some of the harm and to provide as much support as is necessary to drug users in the culture.Now, this is the philosophy behind the needle exchange programs which have gained the favor of the nominee, Dr. Satcher. By giving addicts clean needles, the argument goes, you reduce their chance of becoming infected with HIV, therefore, you improve their quality of life.I, along with a majority of Americans, believe that such policies are nothing more than a subsidy for drug use--providing equipment for drug users to administer illegal drugs to themselves, and hoping somehow that in this safer environment for them and somehow that they have fewer infections.I indicate that that is not the view of most Americans. And I do not think it is the view of many sensible individuals, including Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who is the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. We frequently refer to General McCaffrey as the ``Drug Czar.'' These are the words of General McCaffrey:The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction. . . The focus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not give them more effective means to continue their addiction. One does not want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.Well, I couldn't agree more with General McCaffrey. We do not want to facilitate the dreadful scourge of drugs on mankind. We do not want to accept drug use as a way of life. Furthermore, it is crucial that we understand whatever we do in Government--we teach--we send signals to young people.What are young people to think when they encounter a junkie who wants to convince them to use IV drugs, and young people say, ``Oh, I don't know. I've been told that's wrong. And I've been told that's dangerous.'' But the junkie says, ``Oh, don't worry about that. The Government gives us needles. And we can do this without risk or harm. You don't think the Government would provide us with the tools if this was something that's really wrong, do you?''I think it would be hard, as a young person who was otherwise tempted, to understand that the government would not be endorsing drug use. What does this do to our children? What kind of message does it send to America in terms of that to which we aspire? Does it carry us to our highest and best or does it accommodate us at our lowest and least?Is this harm reduction a means, by saying that we will tolerate this, that we are willing to embrace it, and not only embrace it but to subsidize it? And in so doing, are we willing to corrupt the next generation because we are trying to provide a clean needle? Besides--there are real questions about whether clean needles reduce drug use or not.Obviously, the Congress has rejected this policy of facilitating, in the words of General McCaffrey, the ``dreadful scourge on mankind.''In 1988, the U.S. Congress began banning the use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs. The representatives of the people of the United States of America said, ``My taxpayers, the people who send me here, don't want to spend their money buying needles for drug addicts.''I keep thinking to myself, I will bet you they don't want to buy bulletproof vests for bank robbers either. You could improve the health condition of bank robbers, if you wanted to, and make it safer for them. Under those circumstances, they would less likely die in the commission of a robbery if you would strap a bulletproof vest on them. But I don't think we want to do that because we don't want to participate, with Federal money or State money or any money, in the commission of a crime. It is something we are against doing.I do not think we want to participate in the commission of the drug crimes which spawn the robberies, spawn the assaults in our cities by saying, ``We're going to make this easier for you. We're going to make it less risky for you. We're going to make it cleaner for you. We're going to make it more convenient for you. So any time you need a needle, we can give you one. You won't have to find one or you won't have to try and get one some other way illegally. We'll just make it available to you. That way, you won't ever have to quit taking drugs.''In 1988, Congress began banning the use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs.Last year, in 1997, Congress included language in the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill that would allow the ban to be lifted if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that needle exchange programs reduce HIV among intravenous drug users and does not encourage drug use. Well, I think it would be a very difficult finding to be able to make.Since it is the function of the Surgeon General to advise the Secretary of HHS on such policies, Dr. Satcher's position on the needle exchange program is crucial in the debate.Here you have it. The law now says that we will not spend tax dollars in this respect unless the Secretary of Health determines that needle exchange programs reduce HIV among intravenous drug users and they do not encourage drug use. So all he would have to do is say, well, I kind of think they probably will reduce--or accept a study that might say that they do, or accept a study that says they don't encourage drug use. And having done that, he is in the position to have the law of the United States go from not supporting needle exchange to supporting needle exchange programs.Dr. Satcher's needle exchange position has been very difficult to determine. It has been difficult to determine in substantial measure because they have not been forthcoming. There has been a set of responses made by the Centers for Disease Control which are incomplete. And the more complete they are, the more troublesome they become.A 1992 study conducted by the University of California moved the harm reduction debate into the mainstream of public debate. Also, this is the most often cited study showing that needle exchange programs reduce HIV in intravenous drug users.In 1993, CDC was asked to ``review'' the California study and give its ``opinions and recommendations for Federal action in response to needle exchange'' programs.In the review, the CDC embraced the study findings that needle exchange programs reduce HIV infection among IV drug users and show no evidence of encouraging drug use.The CDC, led by Dr. Satcher, made its recommendations not only on Federal action but also made recommendations on policy changes to State and local governments.The ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs should be removed to allow States and communities the option of including needle exchange programs in comprehensive programs [programs that share Federal funding].In the review, the CDC found the recommendation that State and local governments repeal their drug paraphernalia laws as they ``apply to syringes,'' to be ``reasonable and appropriate.''So here you have the Centers for Disease Control, under the leadership of Dr. Satcher, saying that we ought to urge States to repeal their drug paraphernalia laws concerning syringes that it is a reasonable and appropriate recommendation. He is sending word up the chain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that that is what ought to be done.He is also saying the ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs should be lifted to allow States and communities the option of including needle exchange programs in comprehensive programs.The review also found the California study recommendation that ``substantial Federal funds should be committed both to providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into these programs.'' And they found that recommendations was ``reasonable and appropriate.''So here is what you have. You have the CDC recognizing and evaluating the California study. And then you have the CDC saying, under Dr. Satcher's direction and leadership, that the recommendations are both reasonable and appropriate.And what are those recommendations?They are to spend substantial Federal funds to provide needle exchange services and to expanding research into such needle exchange programs, and they are to recommend that state and local governments repeal their drug paraphernalia laws as they relate to syringes, and they are to say that the ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs should be lifted.Here you have a real conflict. You have the people of the United States against providing needles for drug addicts. You have Dr. Satcher running the CDC, evaluating studies and saying that it is reasonable and appropriate to start spending Federal tax dollars. Then he concludes, based on the studies, that there is no increase in HIV transmission or drug use as a result of needle exchange programs.Now, I have to say that this so-called review by CDC has been very controversial. In fact, it was made public only during the past 2 years after a needle exchange advocacy group obtained and disseminated a copy. Prior to that time CDC even denied Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain copies of the review.Here is what you have. You have the CDC on record in favor of needle exchange programs under the direction of Dr. Satcher. You have a refusal of the agency to provide copies of their review of the report. I can understand Dr. Satcher's trying to distance himself from this review. When I asked for a copy of the CDC's review of this report, it was not forthcoming. And when it was forthcoming, it came to me with a critical piece of the operation missing. What was missing from the report was the letter of Dr. Satcher--the cover letter--where he is ``pleased to submit the attached review.''Now, I have some real reservations about the fact that the CDC would send out the report and not include the cover letter from this nominee. I can understand why this nominee would not want the cover letter to accompany the review because he has sought to lead Members of the Senate and committees of the Senate that he has not endorsed, not participated in programs that would promote needle exchange or clean needles for drug addicts. But I think it is beneath the dignity of the CDC and beneath the integrity of the Senate of the United States to send out the review without having the letter of endorsement on the review that is signed on behalf of David Satcher.In my opinion, for us to make good judgments about individuals who are before the Senate, we have to expect agencies to comply completely with our requests. To provide documents that we ask be provided--selectively--in ways which favor prior statements of a nominee, and to withhold items which might not be as favorable to the nominee and to provide items that might be more favorable to the nominee reflects poorly on the compliance of the agency. It could reflect on the integrity of the nominee if the nominee himself or herself is in control of the agency.It might be possible to argue that, well, maybe the cover letter does not really apply to the recommendations and maybe the signature on the cover letter, which purports to be a signature for Dr. Satcher, is not one that ought to be considered, but I hope that agencies in providing information to the Senate would allow the Senate to make judgments like that.The Centers for Disease Control has withheld relevant and material information I believe in an effort to mislead this body on Dr. Satcher's position on Federal funding for needle exchange programs.A statement was made on the Senate floor that suggested I was trying to mislead my colleagues by saying that Dr. Satcher supports needle exchange programs. A Senator stated that ``Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. Dr. Satcher has recommended to Congress that we allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with this issue. Dr. Satcher believes we should never do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs; the intravenous use of illegal drugs is wrong. He has said that he opposes the use of any illegal drugs.''The key point here is after I indicated Dr. Satcher had promoted and sought to promote illegal drug use, statements were made in the Chamber that he has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs for drug users.Well, I think you can tell from the report I just quoted, which was sent to us finally, begrudgingly--minus the cover letter from Dr. Satcher--that directly contradicts ``Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs.'' No question about it.Let's look at the record. In addition to this, although it is difficult to find since the CDC consistently has withheld and delayed getting requested information to my office, Dr. Satcher has not been forthright in addressing his view on public funding for needle exchange programs. He has embraced the lawyer speak, Clinton speak that we have all heard too much of in the last 6 years. When asked the question about his position on the Federal funding of needle exchange programs, he talks about quality science or the administration's position. He does not simply answer the question.When my office requested information from the CDC on the ``number of needle exchange programs, education or research conferences sponsored with Centers for Disease Control funds,'' I was told that the CDC did not fund such conferences. The cover letter, transmitted with part of the information that we had requested, stated that the ``CDC has participated in several conferences and other activities designed to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS'' but said categorically there were no CDC funded conferences in this respect.Understanding again the lawyer speak, the CDC only funds conferences ``designed to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS,'' therefore, we had to ask for information on all conferences funded by the CDC that were designed to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS. We asked for this information 5 days ago and still have not received it.Even though the CDC stated that it did not fund such conferences. Even though we have a great deal of information, including conference brochures, indicating that the CDC does fund such conferences. They found one ``Award of Notice'' relevant to my request, it was a needle exchange conference that the CDC decided not to fund. This was a Harm Reduction Action Coalition conference that was supposed to be funded by the CDC but the funding was terminated because the CDC could not approve the final agenda. The CDC is forthright in giving me information about a needle exchange conference finding--it is relevant to the request when they terminated funding but not when the funding for the conference actually went through.Let me go over it. We asked them if they had ever funded a conference that regarded needle exchange and whether they would fund such a conference and they sent us documentation that said here is a conference which we're going to fund--which happens to be the needle exchange advocacy group we already have talked about today--but the funding was terminated because we could not agree on the final agenda. They understood that they wanted to support Dr. Satcher's representations to Senators and to the members of the committee of the Senate that he does not support needle exchange programs.So we will look at the record. First, he submitted the review I just mentioned recommending the end to the Federal ban. Under Dr. Satcher's leadership the CDC has cosponsored conferences designed to advance the needle exchange agenda.I have mentioned the cover letter that I was sent by the Department of Health and Human Services Legislative Affairs Office, but now I quote:The CDC does not provide funds to support needle exchange programs, nor has the CDC directly funded any educational research conference on needle exchange, although CDC has, of course, participated in several conferences and other activities designed to reduce the spread of AIDS.What you have here is I have asked them if they ever support conferences on needle exchange. They say no. They say we can show you a document of a conference we denied because it had needle exchange in it. And then outside of their own response with documents we get this logo from a conference sponsored by CDC ``Getting the Point.'' I do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know that this is a needle. ``A conference about clean needle programs sponsored by the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.''Now, it may be a coincidence that the Centers for Disease Control provided me information about a conference which they were going to fund but then terminated the funding, but when I have asked for information from them about conferences which they did sponsor and they omit those carefully--but I doubt it.It may be a coincidence that they omitted the cover letter which provided Dr. Satcher's direct connection to the assessment of the Centers for Disease Control for Federal funding for clean needles and for the conclusions of the California study--which--incidentally are not based on good science--but I doubt it.It seems like it is all too convenient that this agency--in pursuit of this nomination--selectively has provided to the Senate those things which reinforce the stated position, the public position of the nominee and has then deleted from the record those things which do not comport with the position of the nominee.It not only happened as it related to the cover letter on the evaluation of the California study; it happened when we wanted to know whether we really find ourselves sponsoring clean needle conferences and agendas around the country. And conveniently enough the cover letter was deleted and conveniently enough the conference that was funded was deleted, but the conference which was not funded was included in the evidence.I quote from a letter from the Illinois Drug Education Alliance--who attended this Chicago--``Getting the Point'' Conference which was addressed to Dr. Satcher.Dear Director Satcher. As President of the Illinois Drug Education Alliance, I take strong exception to how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are promoting clean needle programs in the State of Illinois. My understanding is that no Federal money is to be spent on clean needle programs, so I do not understand how the CDC can justify promoting clean needle programs. In Chicago, on June 30, 1997, the Chicago Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cosponsored a conference ``Getting The Point'' on clean needle programs. I was one of three IDEA (Illinois Drug Education Alliance) board Members who attended the conference, and I can personally testify that it was totally weighted toward clean needle programs. There were no (in italics ``N-O'') speakers presenting the opposite view.Judy Kreamer, the President of the Illinois Drug Education Alliance, persists to write:We were further alarmed to learn that the CDC is providing technical assistance and financial support for another conference ``HIV Prevention Among Injection Drug Users.'' This Illinois Department of Public Health conference also presents a clearly biased perspective. After a number of telephone calls and cooperation of IDPH, we were able to include a panel, featuring a nationally known expert, to present the opposing view.Critical point. The kind of representations made by Dr. Satcher to Members of the Senate have been that he opposes Federal funding, does not advocate Federal funding for clean needle programs.That was made so convincingly to a number of Members of this body that when I rose to say early in the debate that he advocated clean-needle programs or needle exchange programs, there were those who rose to vociferously contradict it and assure us that that was not the case. I think this evidence speaks for itself.One, he has endorsed the report saying it's reasonable and appropriate to have substantial Federal funding for clean-needle programs. No. 2, he has endorsed a report saying it's reasonable and appropriate to urge that the State laws be changed so that drug paraphernalia laws provide an exception for needles and syringes. Secondly, there is clear evidence, when all the evidence is in--or at least when enough evidence is finally provided--that not only did the Department fail to provide us with notice of the clean-needle programs, there was a selective provision of material requested by the Senate, and that is very, very distressing. The reasoning for not providing the letter was that it was just a transmittal letter, although they did send us, of course, a substantial amount of information. I would like to submit the conference agenda and letter for the Record.I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:11:54.260414,2015-03-17 19:11:54.260414,Senate,EXECUTIVE SESSION,1998-02-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-09/html/CREC-1998-02-09-pt1-PgS474-3.htm,8,86,144,S474-S500,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2951,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. President, I rise today to honor Black History Month by supporting the Sickle Cell Treatment Act, which is S. 874, and inviting my colleagues to join me and my chief cosponsor, Senator Schumer, in doing the same. I am very pleased we now have over 40 bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate for this bill. We certainly would welcome more. I invite our colleagues to look carefully at this act and to support it. It is an important measure. It deals with a disease that afflicts many hundreds of thousands of Americans and a disease that really has not received enough attention and enough visibility in the last few years.This bipartisan, bicameral legislation is designed to treat and find a comprehensive cure for sickle cell disease which is a genetic disease which primarily affects but not exclusively African Americans. About 1 in 300 newborn African-American infants is born with this disease, but the disease also affects people of Hispanic, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ancestry, as well as Caucasians.More than 2.5 million Americans, mostly but again not exclusively African Americans, have the sickle cell trait, which is not the same as having the disease.Why focus on sickle cell disease? Because it is the most common genetic disease that is screened in American newborns. People with the disease have red blood cells that contain an abnormal type of hemoglobin. These cells have a sickle shape, hence the name of the disease, that makes it difficult for the cells to pass through small blood vessels or carry the appropriate amount of oxygen or nutrients or antibiotics, if that has been prescribed. The tissue that does not receive normal blood flow because of the disease eventually becomes damaged and can and often does cause potentially life-threatening complications.Stroke in particular is the most feared complication for children with sickle cell disease. It may affect infants as young as 18 months. I have personally talked with a number of parents whose children have had strokes as toddlers. One of the difficulties with this disease is recognizing it--and I will talk about that in just a minute--recognizing its symptoms. Young children can have strokes without the parents even realizing it for some time.While some patients live without symptoms for years, many others do not survive infancy or early childhood.I became involved with this effort because of an African-American doctor from St. Louis, Dr. Michael DeBaun, who treats children with sickle cell disease. When you meet the practitioners who specialize in treating people who have this disease, you meet a series of American heroes. Dr. DeBaun is one of them. After meeting and visiting with him about a year ago, I realized the hardship this disease puts on families and especially on the children, who often have to receive blood transfusion after blood transfusion in order to avoid strokes. And, yes, in order to stay alive.About one-third of children with sickle cell disease suffer a stroke before age 18. These children require frequent blood transfusions, sometimes 15 to 25 units of blood a year, to prevent subsequent strokes.If you study the disease, you will also learn firsthand how it can affect the daily lives of children. I will just use one example, 9-year-old Isaac Cornell, whom I also had the privilege of meeting. He is one of Dr. DeBaun's patients and attends fourth grade at Gateway Elementary School in St. Louis. About four times a year, Isaac misses school because of severe episodes of pain, with each episode lasting about 5 to 7 days. Every 4 weeks Isaac has to go for a blood transfusion at St. Louis Children's Hospital where he's treated by Dr. DeBaun. Isaac has a permanent port installed in his upper chest to allow for the transfusions. That is one of the reasons he cannot play contact sports or join the wrestling team.Sickle cell disease affects Isaac's decisions every day. He has to drink plenty of water to lubricate his cells, he has to be careful not to overexert himself--and that is certainly difficult for a 9-year-old boy--and he has to be careful to get plenty of rest. Because so many patients like Isaac are struggling with this disease, in April of 2003, Senator Schumer and I introduced the Sickle Cell Treatment Act. Our friends, Representatives Danny Davis and Richard Burr, introduced a companion bill, H.R. 1736, in the House, which now has 39 bipartisan cosponsors.S. 874, which is the bill Senator Schumer and I introduced, has 41 bipartisan cosponsors as well as the support of dozens of prominent African-American children's and health advocates, as well as union and church groups including--I am going to read the list. This is not a complete list, but it includes the Congressional Black Caucus, the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, the American Medical Association, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National Association of Community Health Centers, the NAACP, the Children's Defense Fund, the Health Care Leadership Council, United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union--Minority Coalition, the UFCW Faces of Our Children, United Church of Christ, and National Baptist U.S.A. These advocates, as well as the others who support this legislation, know the bill will make a difference in the lives of kids and families who are struggling with sickle cell disease.I want to outline four key ways in which the bill makes a difference. First, it increases access to affordable, quality health care. The provision provides funding to currently eligible Medicaid recipients for physician and laboratory services targeted to sickle cell disease that are not currently reimbursed or are underreimbursed by Medicaid. Importantly, however, the bill does not increase the number of Medicaid eligibles and the Federal Medicaid match will stay the same. We have structured this bill so it is very affordable.The bill also enhances services available to sickle cell disease patients. This is a crucial aspect of the bill. When you have this disease, you have to stay on top of it. You have to manage this disease. I mentioned Isaac Cornell before, how he drinks water and gets adequate rest and is careful not to overexert himself. You also have to know the various respects in which the symptoms of the disease can show up. This is a tricky, sneaky disease.I was talking with another parent whose son was having considerable dental problems. This is something people with this disease struggle with, because when they get periodontal disease and some form of antibiotic is prescribed by their dentist, they can't be certain the red blood cells will carry the antibiotic to the infected point, so indeed any infections they have are particularly dangerous.Obviously there is a whole medical side to this we have to be aware of, but in addition, people need to know about the disease. They need to receive counseling and education as well as screening, genetic counseling, community outreach. Education and other services are crucial. Currently, those kinds of services are not reimbursed under Medicaid unless they are performed by the physicians such as Dr. DeBaun. Dr. DeBaun simply does not have the time, certainly not as much as he would want to spend, the hours and hours he would need to spend with each set of parents, with each patient, in order to go over all the various ways in which this disease can affect their lives.So it is important that Medicaid reimburse these services, even if they are done by counselors or outreach personnel who are not physicians. They are perfectly appropriate and able to do it. The bill would allow nonmedical personnel such as counselors to spend time with sickle cell disease families to discuss how they can manage the disease. That, by the way, will end up saving the Government money because it will prevent strokes and other serious episodes that then Medicaid does appropriately reimburse.The bill creates 40 sickle cell disease treatment centers. This provision of the bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute grants to up to 40 eligible community health centers nationwide for $10 million for the next 5 fiscal years for a total of $50 million. That is subject to appropriation. That could mean a health center grant in almost every State. Grant money may be used for purposes including the education, treatment, and continuity of care for sickle cell disease patients and for training health professionals.Finally, the bill establishes a sickle cell disease research headquarters. This provision of the bill creates a national coordinating center, which also would be operated by the Department of Health and Human Services, to coordinate and oversee sickle cell disease funding and research conducted at hospitals, universities, and community-based organizations. This will help ensure efficiency so we can share information about the disease, accountability to make sure the taxpayers' dollars are being used well, and also help us get best practices and monitor outcomes for the disease so we can improve services to people who have it around the country.I cannot overemphasize the outpouring of support Senator Schumer and I have received for this bill. I am sure if he were here he would relate the stories he has had. I have myself received personal handwritten letters from sickle cell disease patients who expressed their gratitude for this legislation and who asked what they can do to help pass the bill since they know how many families it will help.For example, Allyce Renee Ford of Blue Springs, MO, wrote, and I will paraphrase: I was pleased to read of your bill to increase funding for treatment of sickle cell disease. My twin sons were born with sickle sell in 1973 and suffered from this debilitating disease all their lives. They both lost the battle to painful complications in 2002. Please believe me, it is a painful life-constricting disease both for the victims and their families. Even though I do not have any other children to lose to the disease, I mourn for all the other parents who will lose their children in the future--today, tomorrow, someday they will lose them. Thank God there will be help for sickle cell disease victims--help not just in the form of additional funding--and the bill is very affordable--but help in the form of greater visibility, community support. This bill is lifting the profile of this disease which has remained in the corner for too long. The business exclusively in the past has been the business of those struggling and the small community helping them. We need to show these people that the country is with them.In conclusion, it is critical to help this historically underserved population. Many of these people do not even know they carry the trait or they have the disease until consequences have been visited upon them that they could have lessened or mitigated in some respect had they had prior knowledge.I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator Schumer to honor Black History Month by cosponsoring this Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Act. I cannot think of a better way to honor this month than to help all of the families, most of whom are African-American families, who are living and struggling with this disease.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:54.559622,2015-03-17 19:11:54.559622,Senate,HONORING BLACK HISTORY MONTH: SUPPORTING THE SICKLE CELL TREATMENT ACT,2004-02-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-02-24/html/CREC-2004-02-24-pt1-PgS1508.htm,20,0,150,S1508-S1509,T000024,mr. talent
2952,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, we are getting into the tobacco wars again today. I know we have made some progress. I have seen in the last week several amendments adopted which I think are very important. As a long-time advocate of assuring full deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed, I was delighted that, and the marriage penalty provision, survived a vote in the Chamber, and also what we called the Bond-Kerry amendment directing that some of the money paid out to the States be used at the very essential early stages of a child's development through early childhood development, parent education to make their children better students, better people, to accept responsibility for them, and providing child care to assure that children in elementary school are not left alone without supervision before and after school.These are steps in the right direction. I understand that one of my colleagues, for whom I have great respect, later on today will come to the floor and seek to strike all mandates on States in this bill.Generally, I have taken the position as a former Governor that we should not be mandating what States do with all of the money that is collected by the Federal Government from our State constituents. In this case, however, I think the situation is a little different because we have been asked by the States to come in and legislate. These actions started off as lawsuits, and it came to the point where they believed that a Federal law was necessary to implement the objectives that the States have and that we share, which is to assure discouraging of teenage smoking. I think that once we go down that path of imposing a major legislative solution--and we are going to be the ones who have to take the responsibility for imposing the fees, for setting up the smoking cessation programs and other things--that there is every reason for us to pose responsible legislative provisions which will have to be agreed to by a majority of both Houses.I would mention the fact that there has been some controversy. I regret we were not able to place a limit on the amount of fees the lawyers for the States would receive. It seems to me we missed an essential ingredient here. We are talking about imposing a settlement or directing a distribution of sums that is not really a settlement of a lawsuit. We are developing a major proposal which is going to raise large amounts of money, provide some tax relief, send some money back to the States. I think we have every reason to say how much money that lobbyists, who are essentially the attorneys who brought the suits--the lobbyists pushing this legislation--should be able to achieve. Some of the figures that have been expressed on the floor about $80,000 to $90,000 an hour are unconscionable. And the people of my State--and I believe the people of the United States--are very much concerned about what is going to be done with all this money. I share that concern.I think before this measure passes, or is finally adopted, there ought to be some limitation. Sure, let the people who worked on it get a reasonable return. But there is no reason to give a small group of people, selected by attorneys general, a windfall of literally potentially billions of dollars from our legislative action. The people who are going to have to be paying the higher fees for cigarettes, I think, have a right to ask us not to permit States to go through with the contracts which give essentially judicial contingent-fee-type rewards to people who are, in essence, coming to us, lobbying for us to pass legislation.I think we ought to be able to establish some conditions on some of the money that goes back to the States. I have said that smoking cessation is important. The educational element is important in ensuring young people at least know the message that smoking can be harmful and that they should not start. I think we need to inform them.I think, second, It is right and proper that, as we did last week, we support the concept in the Bond-Kerrey proposal, that funds going back to the States should be utilized for expanding child care, for assuring adequate early childhood development to ensure that every family takes responsibility for its child's behavior. We ought to be talking about parental responsibility, about family responsibility, about adult care-giver responsibility.I will tell you one other thing. There is something that is lacking in this bill, and I intend to offer--I hope it will be tomorrow--an amendment which will deal with one of the areas that this bill, in my view, wrongfully ignores. We are trying to get teenagers to stop smoking. Where is the responsibility on the teenagers themselves? I know teenagers. I happen to have one in my family. Mine is a fine young man. We have these wonderful, bright-eyed, aggressive, intelligent young people here who are working as pages. Yet we are saying we are going to protect them from everybody else--from the sellers, from the tobacco companies--but we are not saying they have to take any responsibility. Young people are old enough to begin taking responsibility. If they drive a car illegally and they get caught, they get sanctioned. If they drive and they are drinking, or if they are using drugs, in my State they can lose their licenses. Young people ought to know they have some limits and some responsibilities. So I am going to offer an amendment to say to the States: If you want to receive money under these block grants, you ought to set up a system for sanctioning teenagers who purchase cigarettes illegally.We are raising the price, we are providing education, but, as one teenager I talked to said: ``Hey, if all they are doing is saying it's bad and the store that sells it to me is going to be in trouble or the people who make it are going to be in trouble but I can walk scot-free--that's worth a try.'' There are some teenagers who, unfortunatley, in their rebellious teen-age ways--and most of us can still recall when we were teenagers and remember those days--will say, ``That's worth a try.'' If we want to discourage teenage smoking, then there need to be some sanctions on the teenagers.I would lay out a string of sanctions and say, for the first offense, either a $50 fine or a day's worth of community service. A $50 fine might be really heavy on one teenager, but for another teenager it might not make any difference. But if that young man has to spend a day picking up trash along the highway as part of a community service sanction imposed on him for purchasing cigarettes illegally, I don't think he is going to want to be out there in broad daylight in the hot, broiling sun, with all his buddies going by honking and waving at him picking up trash on the highway.I would even go so far as to say parents out to get sanctioned, too. We want to hold parents responsible. We want parents to recognize it is not just Government's responsibility, it is their responsibility as parents. Sure, we have all kinds of sanctions on the sellers, mom-and-pop stores that sell a whole range of things, including a legal product, tobacco, saying: You are really going to get it if youi sell to a teenager.But is it fair to have that penalty only on one side? The amendment I am going to offer, and I hope both sides of the aisle will support, will say: States, you have to come up with a graduated system of sanctions so teenagers will know it is not a risk-free endeavor to try to lure a convenience store operator or a grocery store operator to sell you cigarettes that you should not be buying. Some States are moving ahead and they have sanctions, so they would be in compliance. But I think this bill would be sadly lacking if we set out a system of penalties and tried some educational efforts to convince teenagers they should not do what is illegal, and left them without sanctions.So I hope we can adopt, tomorrow, a measure which does impose sanctions on teenagers or encourages States to say they must set up a reasonable graduated system of sanctions for anybody who purchases--acquires cigarettes illegally. Thus, I would say, when we come to the point about debating whether this bill should have no sanctions or no limitations or restrictions on the States, I think we have gone past that. Once the States came here and asked us to get involved and to set up a scheme to discourage teenage smoking, to raise the price of cigarettes to provide smoking education, provide research, provide health care benefits, we ought to continue down that road and provide the one element which is lacking in the current scheme, and that is strong incentives for States to punish and to impose a reasonable, graduated system of penalties on those who purchase illegally.So I ask my colleagues not to support a removal of all requirements on the States. I ask them--I hope it will be tomorrow when we come forward with our amendment--to support the amendment. My amendment will simply provide incentives for States to impose sanctions on youth who buy or possess tobacco products illegally. We are taking all kinds of steps in the bill to keep cigarettes out of the hands of teens. We are creating new boards and agencies, we are seeking that the tobacco industry limit advertising, we are planning ad campaigns to discourage teens from smoking, we are holding convenience stores accountable for selling cigarettes to teens illegally. About the only people we are not holding responsible are the teens themselves. I ask support for my amendment that will do that.Teen smoking is on the rise at a time when older adults are reducing tobacco consumption. there is more information out there than ever before about the risks of smoking, but teens continue to smoke. Some of that may be rebelliousness. How should we handle that rebellion? Quite simply, by holding teens accountable for their actions. Teens need to know that their actions have consequences. If they purchase tobacco illegally, they should have a penalty to pay--perform community service or kick in with some money to the General Treasury of the entity involved.Mr. President, I ask support for my amendment. If others want to cosponsor the amendment, I welcome having them contact us. We are already working with several Members who are interested. I hope we can get this amendment accepted on both sides. I think it is a responsible and appropriate response to the problem that this measure seeks to address.Mr. President, I yield the floor and, seeing no other Senator present wishing to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.,2015-03-17 19:11:54.831820,2015-03-17 19:11:54.831820,Senate,THE TOBACCO BILL,1998-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-15/html/CREC-1998-06-15-pt1-PgS6309-7.htm,77,0,144,S6309-S6311,B000611,mr. bond
2953,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I believe these are times in which anyone, anywhere would wish to live--times of boundless opportunity when distant horizons are brought near. Since the second year of Ronald Reagan's first term, America has seen her GDP climb every year but one. Our unemployment rate stands at a historic low. Poverty has dropped by more than ten percent. And our budget is in surplus for the first time in a generation.For the first time since 1969, the federal government will run a surplus estimated to be $70 billion. It is a surplus that could allow us to do so much for so many. We could free American families from a debilitating tax burden or help the forgotten middle class keep more of what they earn with tax relief.Beyond meaningful tax relief, the surplus offers another great potential--ensuring the long-term solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund.The surplus is an opportunity for us to honor our commitment to the men who scaled the cliffs at Normandy and the mothers who sent their son to defend America's freedom halfway around the world. It is, Mr. President, a once in a lifetime chance for us to make the paper IOUs in the Social Security Trust Fund real--to pay our debts and keep our word. We can use the surplus to do this.Unfortunately, the President and his apologists on Capitol Hill have a different plan. It is an attack given to platitudes rather than principle, an approach long on meaningless rhetoric and short on meaningful reform. It is a plan that calls for a return to the profligate spending of yesterday at the cost of a brighter tomorrow.As I suggested last Monday on the Senate floor, since late September the President has submitted a series of requests to fund new ``emergency'' spending initiatives. And, because current law subjects discretionary spending to annual caps through FY 2002, this so-called ``emergency'' spending would increase the discretionary spending caps, decrease the budget surplus, and take money from the Social Security Trust Fund.And what are the President's ``emergency'' spending requests? What are the eleventh hour developments that have made Social Security's solvency a low priority instead of a high one? The President is proposing that the equivalent of at least 24% of this year's surplus--$14.4 billion to date--be spent on a Bosnia deployment that is now four years old, government computer repairs, increased embassy security and a variety of other initiatives.Now, I will be the first to concede that many of the President's requests constitute real and important funding issues. But emergencies? Mr. President, the lives of our elderly are too important for half-truths and doublespeak.Social Security should not be betrayed by emergencies that are conjured up and have been anticipated for quite some time. The definition of an emergency is not something that we have known about for 4 years or 2 years or something that we are really trying to get money to spend in the last fiscal year and not in this one.In his January 1998 State of the Union address, President Clinton made the following statement: ``What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four word answer: Save Social Security first. . . . I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--for Social Security.''And just 10 days ago, the President repeated his demand again (October 2, 1998). ``I made it clear and I want to make it clear again. . . . We simply have to set aside every penny of it [the budget surplus], . . . to save Social Security first.''Unfortunately, Mr. President, you can't have it both ways. We can't hide from the truth. More to the point, you can't save Social Security by wasting the surplus on mislabeled emergencies or more big spending. Even as I speak here, the President and his aides are working to see that our seniors' Social Security checks either are shipped overseas or squandered on more bureaucrats in Washington, DC, with more spending programs proposed for money to be shipped overseas or bigger bureaucracies here in the nation's capital. Tragically it is what Chairman Greenspan warned us about just weeks ago. Referring to whether the surplus should be spent, saved, or returned to the taxpayers, Greenspan said, ``. . . I am also, however, aware of the pressures that will exist to spend it, and that in my judgment would be the worst of all outcomes.''Greenspan says, ``. . . the pressures . . . to spend it . . . would be the worst of all outcomes.''Mr. President, if increased spending is labeled as ``emergency'' as an accounting gimmick in order to authorize us to spend the surplus, I will not be a party to it. Labeling the taxpayers' money ``emergency'' doesn't make it any less wasteful. Just because it is called emergency doesn't prevent it from adding government and adding bureaucracy. As was said by another, putting a sign on a pig and calling it a dog doesn't make the pig any less of a pig. And there is going to be plenty of pork in this ``Mother of All Pigs,'' that is coming to the Senate for its approval by way of a proposal for spending.For example, the Wall Street Journal this morning reported that Labor, Health and Human Services and Education account for the single largest part of the Omnibus bill in terms of add-ons sought by the Administration. The President wants a total of $1.6 billion, including almost $1.2 billion for his ``class size'' initiative and another $182 million for a child care block grant.Mr. President, all of this $1.6 billion dollars in increased education spending is paid for from the Social Security Trust Fund. The President has not offered one dime in spending cuts to pay for his ``priorities,'' which he has labeled as ``emergencies.''What is equally as shocking is that the underlying Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill is estimated to be about $4 billion over its spending allocation even before accounting for the extra money sought by the Administration this weekend.The President should explain to the voters that his pledge to ``save every penny of any surplus'' was untrue. His promise to ``save Social Security first'' was just a slogan--offered during his State of the Union with a wink and a nod, and broken days later.Only days after first promising to save the surplus, he submitted a budget to Congress calling for $150 billion in additional spending. And in the entire legislative year since the President made his pledge, he has done nothing to fix the Social Security problem--and far too much to fix the blame. He has wasted this entire year, just as he is proposing to waste our senior's Social Security checks on overseas deployments and projects.If the President truly meant what he said about Social Security, he would propose real fixes instead of empty promises. If the President truly meant what he said about saving the surplus, he would not be trying to spend the taxpayer's money under the camouflage of bogus ``emergencies.''This whole notion of false ``emergency'' spending is a dangerous ploy. It puts the President of the United States in the position of the little boy who cried wolf. If and when we face a true emergency, we will be forced to fund it through this discredited process. And when that time comes, we will regret having engaged in this sleight-of-hand, in this legerdemain, in this charade. Words should have real meaning, Mr. President, and actions should have consequences. Two lessons we would do well to remember.Mr. President, the normal appropriations process is what every American family does when they plan their spending for the upcoming week, or month, or year. Families measure how much they can afford to spend, and where they have to cut back. In some years, when there is an illness or a recession, they may have emergency savings that they use. Perhaps it is a rare occurrence--one they take only in extraordinary circumstances.But think what would happen if families used their savings for non-emergencies--for a new car or a new dress. They would quickly find themselves unprepared for true emergencies.The Federal Government should treat its emergencies the same way families do. Necessary but non-emergency problems should be addressed by achieving savings in lower priority federal spending programs.The President's commitment to send troops to Bosnia was made 4 years ago. It is time to account for that in the normal appropriations process. The Year 2000 problem is a very real threat. But it is also a problem that we have known about for some period of time--since we do have calendars here in Washington. No, instead of anticipating the need and including it in the regular budget process, the President has chosen to ask for this kind of additional funding in the ``emergency'' category. The President is crying wolf and I only hope the Republican Congress has the good sense say, ``No.''Mr. President, I don't agree always with what I read in the newspaper, but here's an editorial with which I do agree. ``Republicans rightly point out,'' the Christian Science Monitor recently noted, ``that there's a double standard here: It's OK for Clinton and the Democrats to propose spending $20 billion of the coming surplus for `emergencies,' but when the GOP suggests returning some of it to taxpayers, that's a `threat' to Social Security.'' (Christian Science Monitor editorial, September 28, 1998)The Christian Science Monitor had it right in that editorial. And the double standard is even worse than the Monitor suggests. For when this $20 billion is spent, the money will be gone. Whereas if we had given it back to the taxpayer, at least we would have provided some measure of relief from the highest tax burden in the history of this republic--a helping hand to the forgotten middle class.And that is the key question here. Who owns the surplus? President Clinton and the Democrat Party see the surplus as own private slush funds--money he can hoard with the shield of false promises, but spends whenever it suits them.I would argue that the American people own the surplus. And it is time to give it back. As we have learned with all too great a frequency in recent years, if we leave the surplus in Washington, supposedly far-sighted bureaucrats will find a way to spend it.For there is no end to the good Washington believes it can do with their brains and our money. This town specializes in spending.I believe it is time for us to make the American people aware of the deceitful and dishonorable efforts to use the budget surplus on mislabeled emergencies and increased spending. I came to Washington 4 years ago to cut taxes and decrease government interference in our lives.I also made a sacred commitment that I would protect and defend the Social Security Trust Fund. I intend, therefore, to oppose any effort to spend the elderly's Social Security checks on overseas deployments or the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., and mislabeling those things as ``emergencies'' will not change my commitment or determination.Mr. President, I yield the floor.PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

2954,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, as I think we all know, far too many families in America are seeing the American dream of owning their own home slip away.Over the Easter break, I toured the State of Missouri. In every community around the State I met with people who are struggling under the threat of foreclosure, neighborhood groups concerned about the impact of foreclosure on their families and on their communities, mayors, city council leaders who are seeing their communities threatened seriously by this spate of subprime foreclosures, and most of all mothers and fathers with children who are facing the loss of their home.I did not talk with speculators, investors, or the folks on Wall Street, but the people I talked to did have a number of thoughts--thoughts they believe would help them keep the promise of keeping their home. They did not want a Federal bailout. But they were looking for ways to make the system work for them.Some of the suggestions they made were at the macro level and, among others, they said there ought to be regulation--probably Federal regulation--of those who originate mortgages. Now, many of the bricks-and-mortar lending institutions--banks, and savings and loans in the community--are regulated, but there are many mortgages, subprime mortgages, that were sold over the Internet and by fax. Whenever I go home, my fax machine is filled with 1 percent mortgage teaser rates.They also want to see HUD be able to move more quickly in getting the FHA secured loans. That is a good idea--to go in and to help homeowners whose mortgages have reset and caused them to lose their homes--but it is too narrow. They think that ought to be reformed.I believe that through FHA, we, as taxpayers, should not be put at risk by insuring loans where there is zero downpayment. Regrettably, zero downpayment too often means the homeowner can't afford that mortgage and they walk away. The often cited program, the Nehemiah Program, which provides charitable contributions to take care of the downpayment requirements, has an appalling 30 percent default rate. That is a raid on the Federal Treasury. We ought not to be doing that. Before people make a loan, they ought to have counseling and education to make sure their finances, their income will support the mortgage payments.Also, when you buy a home, you might have to support the replacement of a furnace that blows or a leaky roof, things that renters don't have to pay. If they can't afford to buy a home, we want to see them in a good home that could be a rental home.But the most important thing they said we could do now is provide counseling, to bring together those homeowners whose homes are in foreclosure or who are facing foreclosure, to sit down with the lenders and see if they can work out an agreement before they go to foreclosure. Everybody says: Well, what interest does a lender have in avoiding foreclosure? Well, foreclosures are expensive. They drive down the value of the property and potentially put at risk the value behind other mortgages they may own in the same community.Last fall, Senator Dodd and I agreed to include $180 million in the Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill to begin counseling. The first $130 million has gone out. We are beginning to see the results of that. Those counseling dollars can help homeowners, if they will go to a counseling entity such as The United Way or local governments to get counseling, before they wind up on the courthouse steps.In addition, there need to be dollars available to buy down mortgages where the mortgage rates have skyrocketed because of the subprime crisis. That is why, in the SAFE Act which I have introduced with my colleagues--the Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act--we make sure there is money available through the State Housing Finance agencies. I know well the Housing Finance Agency in Missouri--the Missouri Housing Development Corporation--and they have a great plan. If they can have more money, maybe $160 million to $180 million, possibly $200 million in Missouri, they could go in and buy out mortgages where the private mortgage holder has had to increase substantially the rate because of the overall market conditions. If these HFAs can sell paper, tax-exempt paper, they can bring back the mortgage rates to the level that was affordable initially.It is very important for fixed-income homeowners to count on a certain mortgage payment. Some have seen it go up 50 percent, and too many of them are being forced to the choice of walking away because they can't meet it. We need to get HFAs to have the ability to go in and refinance those mortgages.In addition, with Senator Isakson, we have included in the SAFE Act a measure to provide a tax credit for families willing to buy a home in foreclosure or going into foreclosure. In other words, it would be a $5,000 tax credit for each of 3 years for families who would move into one of these homes either in foreclosure or facing foreclosure. That not only gives a boost to first-time home buyers, but the most important thing it can do for communities is avoid the problem of having a community with 20 percent of the homes in foreclosure.This isn't a problem for just the 20 percent of the families who are facing foreclosure; that is a potential disaster for the other 80 percent of the homeowners because what it does to the value of their homes and to the value of every house in that community is to drive the values down significantly, so they may find their home is worth less than the value of the mortgage.Finally, we want loan transparency. As a former lawyer, I have had the dubious pleasure of going through home purchasing documents several times recently. They give you a stack of paper this high that has all been written by lawyers, God bless them, and it has every contingency spelled out. But most people who go through the purchase process spend 40 minutes signing the papers without knowing what is in them. What we want is a very simple disclosure on top, which is binding on the lender and on the borrower, that says what the rate will be, if it is adjustable, how high it can adjust, when it can adjust, if there is a prepayment penalty, and what are the other terms that might cause significant economic distress to the home buyer. They need to know that in advance. Also, there ought to be counseling to help those prospective home buyers measure their financial ability, their ability, through their income, to buy a home and to make sure they can afford the mortgage they are seeking.I hope this is the basis on which almost all of us in this body can agree. We have heard a lot about what is going on at the macro level. There are important things happening with the Fannie Mae and the Freddie Mac, such as getting $200 billion more that they can loan, and the Federal Reserve moving in. All these things are important on a large national scale.This is not only, however, a national and international problem; most of all, it is a community problem. The proposals we have set forth in the SAFE Act are designed to help build up from the community level the solutions we need for home buyers and homeowners, particularly those threatened with foreclosure. We are only going to solve this problem if we work community by community. The SAFE Act is designed to help homeowners, counselors, and local government officials deal with the problem in their communities and build, community by community nationwide, the solutions to the problem that affects not just homeowners but affects our entire country.I invite our colleagues to look at this legislation. I hope we can discuss it, as our leader has said, and come to agreement on some things we can pass, and pass right now, because too many homeowners are facing a crisis and need help.I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:55.555328,2015-03-17 19:11:55.555328,Senate,HOUSING CRISIS,2008-04-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-04-01/html/CREC-2008-04-01-pt1-PgS2254.htm,50,0,154,S2254-S2256,B000611,mr. bond
2955,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the American economy. I think most of us are talking about it. Most everybody is thinking about it. With the financial markets in turmoil, the confidence of investors and consumers across my home State of Missouri, the Nation, and the globe is being challenged. Most of the media focus is on the struggles in Wall Street. My concern is for American families, anxious about their security, the security of their savings, their retirement, their assets, and their pensions.I was disappointed to see that Leader Reid, just a day or so ago, said no one knows what to do at the moment. There are steps taken in an emergency matter. The fire department in this matter has been the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. We will look at and evaluate their judgment, but it appears they have at least stemmed the tide at this point.But there are a lot of things that we ought to be talking about doing now. There are changes that need to be made. There are changes that need to be made in regulation, there are changes that need to be made by legislation, there are changes that need to be made in attitudes.If you want to get into the blame game, I assure you there is plenty of blame to go around. This concept, the original concept of government-sponsored enterprises, well, that is one that certainly got off the track. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle sponsored GSEs. But they got themselves trapped way out in financial derivative speculation and got outside their charter. The regulation was inadequate. There are some of us who called for a strong regulator. Others who were defending the GSEs said: No, no, no, we like having an ineffective regulator. There are a lot of examples of that. But this is not the time to point fingers. The American people want solutions because these are serious and difficult times for everyone. As I said, families are worried about their personal finances and savings.American families are already struggling with the housing crisis as well as high energy prices, which lead to food and other cost increases, as well as health care and education. Those have to be foremost in our minds. I understand. I have listened to the people in my State. I have heard their concerns.These families need to know that the country's leaders take their concerns seriously and are working together to make the right response to this crisis. We have to instill confidence in the public that our actions are also driven by the best interests of taxpayers so they and future generations are not saddled with debts driven by unnecessary bailouts and that Government has a plan to avert similar future crises. To instill confidence, we must show true leadership and, I would hope, put aside the politics of blame and partisanship. We have had enough of that already. The American people have had too much of that. Enough. That ought to be it. Leadership should be about bringing people together and coming up with real solutions driven by the best interests of our families and country.Leadership is needed now more than ever. I call for my colleagues in Let me share some of the ideas I laid out in a letter I sent out First, we must all recognize that America's financial system is struggling under the weight of greed, laced with regulatory loopholes, and compromised by complexity. Only fundamental reform of those excesses will prevent abuse from returning. We need reform to provide greater oversight, transparency, and accountability so that our economy, housing system, and consumers are adequately protected. The status quo is clearly unacceptable, and taxpayer-funded bailouts are not the answer. It is time that we reform our antiquated regulatory system to close loopholes to prevent the same type of problems we are currently experiencing, by taking a number of actions to address our regulatory system, ensure better market stability, and protect consumers.Regulation needs to be carefully considered because there are very strong arguments that some of the problems today where some of the major institutions were put in a trap are the result of the post-Enron wave of trying to make everything bad illegal. Mark-to-market accounting was one of the things that has been instituted well depending upon how you apply it when you are in a meltdown. Right now, the value of a house covered by a mortgage may have declined 10 to 20 percent. But if nobody is buying that mortgage, if there is no market today for that mortgage, it might be marked to zero--to zero--when, in fact, the real value is probably no less than 75 or 80 percent. That puts a hit on the balance sheets, and that has repercussions throughout the system. That may be part of the cause. We need to look at that.We need to see if excessive regulation in mark to market has put businesses at risk that should not be at risk, that should not be pushed into bankruptcy. Just as the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, designed to curb excesses--which were actually punished under existing law--has driven many of our financial institutions offshore, we have to be concerned about what the impacts of the regulations are. But I firmly believe that corporations must be held accountable for their bad decisions.Similarly, we must find a way to prevent the use of golden parachutes to reward executives for their failed leadership. I think we were all outraged to hear the golden parachutes that were going to be given to the leaders of the GSEs who had been responsible for their institutions being wiped out essentially and put into conservatorship. I do not want a single taxpayer dollar going to pay them bonuses. If a baseball manager does a bad job, he gets fired. When we have a bad job being done by a financial institution head, the taxpayers sure ought not be called on to give that executive millions of dollars in a golden parachute.But we also must find a way to restore personal responsibility in society. Responsible investors have an obligation not to enter into investments they do not understand. Responsible private citizens have an obligation not to take on debt they cannot afford.Mortgage brokers should no longer receive special treatment allowing them to escape regulation and licensing requirements standard for brokers of other financial products. The Treasury's Regulatory Blueprint issued last March contains many positive recommendations, such as the creation of a new Federal commission, the Mortgage Origination Commission, which I support. I plan to introduce legislation to establish the Mortgage Origination Commission.The Federal Government must step up its efforts in financial literacy and education, and pre- and post-purchase housing counseling. Most borrowers made responsible decisions in selecting appropriate financing vehicles for purchasing their homes and other major assets. Unfortunately, a large number of borrowers either knowingly or unknowingly agreed to loans that were detrimental to their families and their credit.Mr. President, I stand ready to work with my colleagues here in the Senate on working on real solutions so that our Nation has confidence that we are here for them.We have talked about the American dream. There are some who, in the name of the American dream, have pushed home ownership on people who could not afford it. Clearly, home ownership is part of the American dream, and in assisting families and individuals, we should do all we can to achieve that. I have worked for that as lead appropriator on housing on this side of the aisle for many years.However, we have seen that American dream become the American nightmare when people have been given too-good-to-be-true offers for mortgages and asked to take on mortgages that consume all of their available income.Well, I will tell you something, having a little experience in owning homes. Along with home ownership comes some potential financial responsibilities. A couple of weeks ago, we had to have our basement pumped out. That costs a lot of money. In the winter, I have had furnaces go down, or if we have a family emergency, that may make the mortgage payments unaffordable. We must ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, people understand that the benefits of home ownership are balanced against the risks and the costs to the homeowner, the neighbors, the communities, and even the financial marketplaces. Home ownership must be promoted, not on the basis of getting the number of homeowners up to an arbitrary level but in a responsible manner focusing on the best interests of families and not on investors or others pushing mortgages.You can live in rental housing until you have the funds to buy a house. I have lived in rental housing. Many people live in rental housing. Before you decide to buy a home, if you are not financially well experienced, there are a lot of good counseling concerns around that can help you determine if you can buy a home and help you determine how much you can afford to pay and what kind of mortgage you can afford to take on.I worked with Senator Dodd last year to get $180 million for counseling for homeowners facing foreclosure. Well, that is working, and we are seeing a tremendous need for that counseling. I have visited with homeowners being counseled by housing counselors, with housing advocates, with community leaders, local officials who are worried about their communities going down, and the one thing every one of those people say is: We need counseling not just at the time of possible foreclosure but before they purchase the house so they do not get in the crack of foreclosure.Well, I think we have to strengthen the oversight, the regulatory oversight of the housing finance market. The creation of a new regulator with more expansive powers to oversee the two mortgage government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, if they continue to exist, was a long overdue and necessary step.While the importance of making this legislative change cannot be understated, I emphasize the critical need to ensure that the new regulator not repeat the same mistakes made by its predecessor. That regulator did not examine, did not look at the practices, did not call attention to the practices that the GSEs were engaged in, which may have provided some short-term profits to their shareholders and certainly healthy returns for their executives, but they failed to identity and said that these were sound operations.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter I referred to earlier printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:11:55.847536,2015-03-17 19:11:55.847536,Senate,THE ECONOMY,2008-09-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-09-18/html/CREC-2008-09-18-pt1-PgS8968.htm,149,2,154,S8968-S8976,B000611,mr. bond
2956,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, yesterday, I had the pleasure of traveling to Lee's Summit, MO, to talk about the problem of health care. Right now, we know about 47 million Americans do not have health insurance. That is a huge burden for those families. It is a big problem for all of us as policymakers who need to be addressing this issue.I went with the President and HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt. We toured the Saint Luke's Health System Hospital in Lee's Summit, which represents a very important next step in information technology for health care.The information on patients coming in--from the diagnosis to the x rays--is all included on a basic computer format, which makes it available to any physician or nurse or other health care provider working with that patient. Even the radiologist does a description of what the x ray means, which is included by voice transcription directly into the program that is on the computer. It is linked through each room, so at a distance, for smaller rural hospitals, experts can do as thorough a diagnosis as they could in the room, with the exception they cannot physically put their hands on the patient.But this has brought this hospital into a state where more and more hospitals want to go. We have the best technology. We have the best health care providers. We have the finest new medications, prescription drugs, that have dealt with many of the illnesses. But we have a much more expensive system because we have such quality care. The President has outlined a proposal on how we can incentivize Americans to buy insurance, keep health care costs under control, and maintain private control of health care decisions, leaving it in the hands of the patients and the providers.Well, I believe the President has said the best way to do that is through private health insurance. He says that is a debate we ought to have in Washington. We believe the private sector is the best delivery vehicle of health care. We know there is a role for the Federal Government, but it is not to dictate, it is not to be the decisionmaker.As he suggested, I think it makes sense to look at the Tax Code as part of the solution to the problem. Right now, if you pay your own health insurance, you pay taxes on the entire cost. If you are an individual, you get no benefit from paying your health insurance. But if you have an employer who pays for your health insurance, either all or part of it, you get that tax free.I think that creates a very unlevel playing field. The President's proposal would establish a more equitable system, one I hope this body will carefully consider through the HELP Committee--to look at it, look at the details, criticize it, change it, but at least give it a full hearing.I was rather disappointed, yesterday, before we even went out, to see some leaders of the majority party saying, oh, it is dead on arrival. Well, we are in such need of having real solutions to health care, I suggest this is a serious proposal that warrants serious discussion. I do not know all the details of it. But I had an opportunity to ask questions of staffers. I listened intently as the program was presented to a number of small business owners and small business employees who were very excited about the prospect of getting a tax break at a minimum of maybe some $2,200 a year if they bought health care--whatever minimum program their States would provide--if they were a single person, they would get $7,500 off of their tax bill; if they are a married couple, filing jointly, they would get $15,000.Now, you may ask the question: Well, if they are low income and do not have to pay any income tax, where would the benefit come from? Well, by lowering their AGI, or the adjusted gross income, they would not be subject to Social Security and Medicare costs. So at the $15,000 level, that would exempt $15,000 from payroll taxes for FICA and Medicare.So they were very encouraged that they would, for the first time, be able to afford health care. The small business owners were anxious to provide it for their employees or see their employees have access to it.There are lots of questions about how it works. But from what I understood, you have to determine what is it you have to buy to qualify. I think at this point the thinking is that the States would determine what that base program is. It would obviously have to have some kind of catastrophic care.It is my hope that it would also include preventive care to make sure people stay healthy. It is particularly important for children. We are going to be renewing the SCHIP program to make sure children in poor families have that kind of coverage. The best investment we can make in the future is assuring that our youngest citizens get off to a good start with good health care, identifying potential problems and treating them early and getting them off to a start in their education, giving them the opportunity to begin life with good health. And a good education is No. 1. SCHIP would be available for the children of families who are at the bottom of the income ladder. But for all children, I hope they will be buying a health plan that focuses on preventive care, making sure people know what they have to do to stay healthy, and identifying problems before they become serious.The States would be given flexibility to use additional funds which the Federal Government makes available to the States to implement their programs. Some States already have ways of assisting their lower income people, not the poorest but the lower income workers, providing the assistance for payments of premiums, if that is what the State wishes to do. So there is a lot of room for innovative programs at the State level.The night before, the Governor of Missouri, Matt Blunt, offered another program, for example, and that is to say to all businesses: If you offer a health care plan to your employees that meets basic minimum State standards, you will be exempted from the franchise tax--a great boon to encourage Missouri businesses to offer all of their employees at least a basic health care plan. Proposals like that would be encouraged, and the great laboratories of the States could move forward to determine what kinds of things work best.There was some question--I don't know where it came from--that this might cut back on our support of FQACs, federally qualified health centers, what we call community health centers. There is no truth to that. The President is a big supporter--as is, of course, his Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt--of making sure there are health care clinics available in every area of the country. They have been on a vigorous expansion program and intend to continue that. I have visited health care clinics, over 50 of them, in different parts of our State, from the center cities to the suburban areas to the larger communities in rural areas to the most economically challenged, lowest population areas of the State. Those are absolutely the most critical safety net we have. I believe strongly in them. I have worked with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to support them. They must continue to be there.We are talking in this plan about using the Tax Code to make health insurance more available, but community health centers have the important challenge of making sure it is accessible. In many places, the only place you can find a doctor who will deliver babies is in a community health center or through a community health center, or find a dentist who will take care of dental problems. A shocking statistic we heard: 80 percent of 17-year-olds have serious dental problems in the United States. We have made dental care part of it. But these people who work in the community health centers are a vital part of our health care network.The President's plan envisions strengthening that safety net. In addition, he remains committed to allowing small businesses to go together in pools to purchase health insurance and avoid the high premiums often charged to individual small businesses and the cost of administering those plans, which becomes extremely burdensome for many small businesses. I hope this year we can also pass association health plans.Finally, the President spoke very forcefully about the need to continue the effort for medical malpractice reform. We saw the need for it in Missouri. Missouri passed a bill, and we started getting much better health care. In the western part of the State, until Missouri passed its medical malpractice reform, there were no doctors, outside of government hospitals, who could afford to be in the business of delivering babies. This is a problem which translates into higher costs of medicine because with unrestrained medical malpractice lawsuits being filed, there is a real danger that a great deal of time and effort will be wasted on unnecessary procedures for fear of the impact of a malpractice lawsuit. Many times, even the best doctors have maloutcomes. People don't live forever. We are all going to die from something. If there is a lawsuit filed against a doctor every time there is a bad outcome, they are going to be faced with insurance costs that go through the roof or health care that is not available.I go back to the point that this is a concept, the outlines of which I think I know but which I think deserve a fair hearing. I hope that as we take a look at the many challenges facing us, our HELP Committee and our Finance Committee will look at the President's program to determine whether it may be one way of assuring we get health care insurance to many of the 47 million Americans who don't have it. I urge that they do so. I am sure there will be changes all of us would like to make, but I believe the concept merits a hearing. I urge my colleagues to give it that chance.Madam President, I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:56.164790,2015-03-17 19:11:56.164790,Senate,FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007,2007-01-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-01-26/html/CREC-2007-01-26-pt1-PgS1212-2.htm,16,51,153,S1212-S1232,B000611,mr. bond
2957,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Madam President, over the past week, I have taken a good look at the President's budget submission. I am new around here, and I will admit that the Federal budget is very complex. But as somebody who has spent the last years of my life as an auditor, I have come to one inescapable conclusion about the budget that has been presented to this Congress for consideration. First, it is not honest; second, it has the wrong priorities.This budget reflects part of the problem we have; that is, our country is facing incredible problems that are very difficult, and we want the American people to support us and believe in us. We cannot expect them to join us in a fight against these complex problems if we aren't going to begin the process by being honest with them. We cannot expect them to support what we do if we are not willing to tell them the complete and unvarnished truth about the situation we face in America today in terms of our budget.The President claims with a straight face that this budget will eliminate the deficit by 2012. In fact, the President claims it will create a surplus in 2012. That sounds great. The problem is, it is not true. The numbers do not add up. First, he fails to include the full cost of the war in Iraq. In this budget, it says the war will only cost $50 billion in 2009. Keep in mind that in this budget cycle, we will spend over $240 billion on the war in Iraq. The confusing part to me about the $50 billion is that it is a mystery. Why is this $50 billion a mystery? It is a mystery because no one seems to know where the figure came from.As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I had the opportunity to listen, as the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and even the Comptroller for the Department of Defense were asked the question: Where did the $50 billion figure come from? They did not know. If the leadership of our military and the highest ranking financial official in the Department of Defense do not know where a figure in the budget came from for our war effort, what does that tell you about the integrity of the document? If that figure came from somewhere other than the leaders of the military, we have a problem.The President also conveniently left out the long-term cost of alternative minimum tax relief for the middle class, which the administration knows we all support. The AMT was never designed to reach down into the middle class, as it does and will continue to do in an ever-increasing way, to cause even more stress and pressure on a middle class that believes it is under attack from all sides. Furthermore, this budget assumes deep cuts in education and health care, cuts that the administration knows are not realistic.Finally, it hides the long-term cost of the President's ill-advised program to privatize Social Security. This budget is a gimmick. It is the kind of gimmick that the American people have grown very tired of. If proper budgeting procedures were followed, the Federal Government would still be hundreds of billions of dollars in the red by 2012.If it is not bad enough that this budget is not honest with the American people as to what its implications are, it is even worse when you look at the priorities. First, let's talk about the tax cuts in the President's budget. It preserves billions of dollars in oil subsidies, despite the fact that, once again, we just heard that one of the big oil companies had a record profitmaking quarter. Second, there is $73 billion in this budget to extend tax cuts for millionaires through 2012. I am not talking about tax cuts for people who make $200,000 a year or $300,000 a year. I am talking about for millionaires, $73 billion. Maybe you think that is not so bad, $73 billion for millionaires, until you realize the rest of the story that is contained in this budget.In this budget, the President wants our veterans to spend as much as $15 billion more for the health care they have been promised. According to McClatchy newspapers, this figure could be as high as $15 billion. It is at least $5 billion for additional enrollment fees in health care and additional pharmaceutical costs. Our veterans are being given a tax increase. They say it is not a tax increase; it is a revenue enhancement. This budget is filled with revenue enhancements, also known as user fees, also known as tax increases. So we have a tax cut in this budget for the millionaires, and we have taxes being raised on our veterans. We also have $37.8 billion over 10 years for seniors to increase their Medicare premiums. Tax cuts for the millionaires; tax increases for our veterans and seniors.Besides the seniors and veterans, who else will pay? Our children will pay through cuts in the health insurance program for children. There may be a little more money in this budget, but there is not enough money to cover the children who currently are covered under this program in the United States. Missouri is one of those States that has a shortfall in funding. If we do not fix the President's budget, we will be taking care of the millionaires, and tens of thousands of children will be removed from health care rolls in the State of Missouri.The COPS Program is cut, law enforcement. College loan programs are cut.I have heard in the last couple of years in my life the phrase ``support our troops'' as often as I have heard almost the words ``good morning.'' I have heard it in this room dozens of times in the last few days, as people have argued about the war in Iraq and said, ``You are not supporting our troops. You have to show that you support our troops.''This budget is the way we show whether we support our troops. Supporting our troops is not a phrase for a political campaign. It is not something to be bandied about to get political advantage, over which resolution we are voting on, or who looks better, the Republicans or the Democrats. It should be embodied in what we do as we decide the priorities for the money we spend on behalf of the American people.In this budget, we have said to veterans coming home--and that we are talking about veterans under the age of 65--that they will have to pay more. That is being proposed at the same time we are walking around here righteously indignant that we are not doing enough to support our troops. In reality, the veterans of this Nation have been losing benefits throughout the Iraq war conflict. They have been fighting for their health care, fighting to see a doctor, and waiting in long lines. This budget is an opportunity to quit talking the talk and begin to walk the walk when it comes to the men and women who have put their lives on the line for our flag and for the country we love.There are not very many veterans coming home from Iraq who are having sleepless nights, worrying about the estate tax on their $10 million estates. There are not very many veterans coming home from Iraq who are worried about their capital gains tax on a multimillion dollar piece of property or their stock portfolio. But there are veterans coming home from Iraq who are having sleepless nights about their health care, about their children's health care, about their children's education, and about their retirement security.This budget does not reflect that we care about those veterans and their sleepless nights. Let's make the phrase ``support the troops'' mean something other than trying to jockey for position in a political game of hardball. Let's get our priorities straight. Let's fix this deeply flawed budget for the American people, and let's begin by being honest about the budget.,2015-03-17 19:11:56.477984,2015-03-17 19:11:56.477984,Senate,THE BUDGET,2007-02-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-02-12/html/CREC-2007-02-12-pt1-PgS1834.htm,26,0,153,S1834-S1835,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
2958,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, as a Member of the Senate who has traveled every year to Southeast Asia and met frequently with government leaders from that region when they visited the United States, I believe America has great interests in that region, and that we need to pay more attention here in Washington, DC and across the Nation, to our allies and partners in Southeast Asia.This region, economically, politically, strategically important, it is our 5th largest in total volume trading partner. Serving as a cornerstone to SE Asia and the lynchpin to its stability, prosperity and security lie in Indonesia.When I have asked leaders from all over Southeast Asia how they are doing, they always include a reference to Indonesia. Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country and as a democracy, that makes it the largest Muslim democracy as well.On the darker side, it is also a key country in what many in the intelligence community, and I agree, is the second front in the war on terror that we confront. It is home to the Islamist terrorist group, Jemah Islamiya, which next to al-Qaeda, is one of the greatest threats to American security and peace in the world.Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has been executing an ambitious agenda for anti-corruption, political and economic reform. He represents Indonesia's best hope for continuing down a path towards stability, prosperity, pluralism, democracy and security. Such a path is not only in our own economic interests, but is also essential to control the terrorist threat and the reach of al-Qaeada and Jemah Islamiah in Southeast Asia.Since the fall of President Suharto, the Indonesian people have elected three new presidents, impeached one, and experienced several peaceful transfers of power. They have held direct elections of a president. They have amended their constitution in order to be more democratic and transparent. They have given the judicial branch independent administrative and financial authority. They continue to reform their military in accordance with democratic, civilian-controlled principles.They have recently provided a battalion to support the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon; and Indonesia was recently cited by Freedom House as Southeast Asia's only truly ``free'' nation.But despite all the progress being made, we in Congress seem to continue to look for every transgression to put our relationship on hold and move it backwards.The truth is that as a country, Indonesia has made truly remarkable progress in a very short period of time. As such, they deserve continued support and engagement, not restrictions and retractions.We should recognize the accomplishments of the Indonesian people and encourage them in their pursuit of a successful transformation to a democratic nation.This is why I, along with my distinguished colleague Senator Inouye, am proud to introduce a resolution recognizing Indonesia's accomplishments and the increasingly mutually beneficial relationship between Indonesia and the U.S.As an archipelago of over 200 million people, if Indonesia were superimposed over the top of the United States, it would span from Florida to Alaska. The size of Indonesia and the fact that they have 17,000 islands at low water, 13,000 at high tide, presents a tremendous challenge in defending its borders and dealing with potential terrorist activities on its distant islands or remote jungles.The Indonesian armed forces are a necessary partner in this battle. When Jemah Islamiah bombed the Bali nightclub in 2002, killing 202 people, Indonesia's military, policing and intelligence capabilities were in poor condition. Of late however, Indonesia's security forces have ``gained the upper hand,'' according to the Economist, June 16th, 2007 with the capture and arrest of some of Jemah Islamiah's top commanders.Leadimg the fight against terror is Indonesia's new police unit 88, which was set up with the help of American and Australian Security forces. Among the terrorists captured was Abu Dujana, one of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists. Dujana apparently took over as military leader of JI when their former leader and bomb maker, Azahari Husin, was in 2005 killed and had earned the dubious honor of being named the most wanted terrorist in the country. And over the last 12 months, the Indonesians have captured or killed 47 terrorists, including several key leaders.The article also went on to say. . . .No large-scale attacks have taken place since 2005. With the help of their Australian and American counterparts, Indonesia's national police have greatly improved their tracking of militants and have rounded up some of JI's top leaders.In the recent past, there have been various forms of restrictions on our relations with the Indonesian military in light of terrible abuses that were committed by the TNI in East Timor. However, our reinstatement of military relations and the restoration of International Military Education & Training or IMET, has resulted in continued positive trends.It is interesting to note that the current President, when he was a military leader, was in the last class of IMET leaders from Indonesia to come to the United States. He, in his own person, demonstrates the appreciation of civilian control. Some in this body and the other body want to impose new restriction to hinder, not help, the productive influence our military can and has had on the TNI.We must expand and continue to improve our relations with the TNI, not restrict and retract. IMET provides for adherence to the Code of Military Justice, civilian of the military, respect for human rights, and proper treatment of population principles that should be instilled in military forces.Further, IMET establishes important relationships and alliances among our military leaders and commanders of friendly foreign forces. It assures they understand how to conduct military or relief operations together. and, it keeps the U.S. engaged in a region where China is increasingly, extending its influence. When I visited the North Western province of Ache, right after the Tsunami, the fact that their military had not trained with us caused us great military operational difficulties.Some in Congress apparently want to reimpose sanctions on IMET participation because of the past and perceived military abuses, but as Walter Lohman, Director of Asian Studies at the Heritage Foundation, has said:accountability for past human rights abuses and the proper role of the militia are legitimate. But the United States needs to get to a point where it addresses these concerns with the same respect it affords other democratic partners, like the Europeans or the JapaneseMany leaders in that region have told me, privately, they believe U.S. active engagement and association with their countries is essential to stop China from extending hegemony over the region. Whether China is viewed as a threat or an opportunity, they are actively courting their neighbors in SE Asia; They are sending official trade missions, signing trade agreements and investing their large reserves in securing sources of energy and natural resources. Make no mistake about it, they are aggressively building up a military force navy capable of extending beyond the straits of Taiwan.The opportunities and the challenges related to China seeking to extend its influence over Southeast Asia should concern us both economically and militarily. States of Southeast Asia, notably Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia, control the important Malacca Straits; Straits through which one quarter of all the shipping in the world passes and one half of the petroleum products carried by ocean-going vessels pass.Beyond those interests, it remains my thesis that we should pay attention to Southeast Asia--particularly Indonesia--as the second front in the war on terrorism.Indondsia represents the best hope for fostering a moderate Islam that recognizes the true peaceful nature of that religion in opposition to the radical terrorist-inspiring versions of Islam.With Southeast Asia and its large Muslim population, we have an opportunity through constructive forms of engagement; to ensure they become a solid foundation for peace, security and economic prosperity in this critical part of the world. Whether it is more peace corps volunteers, education initiatives, leadership exchanges, IMET or sending Navy ships such as the USS Mercy and USS Peleliu on humanitarian missions to the region.We can do it without the need for massive military actions such as those we have undertaken in Afghanistan and Iraq to root out the terrorists and in those cases, the governments that harbored them. In other words, more sandals on the ground now, will prevent having to put boots on the ground in future.I urge my colleagues to support countries like Indonesia in their path towards peace, democracy and pluralism, as opposed to restricting and pushing them towards more radical, terrorist-inspiring versions of Islam.I ask or behalf of Senator Inouye and myself that the resolution be sent to the desk and ask that it be referred appropriately.I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the articles from the June 16th Economist and from Walter Lohman of the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation.,2015-03-17 19:11:56.732166,2015-03-17 19:11:56.732166,Senate,SENATE RESOLUTION 252--RECOGNIZING THE INCREASINGLY MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA,2007-06-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-06-22/html/CREC-2007-06-22-pt1-PgS8306.htm,102,1,153,S8306-S8309,B000611,mr. bond
2959,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Madam President, I rise today to talk about the role of government in the technology sector. Two things can be predicted with confidence about congressional meddling in this sector of the economy. First, legislation will be obsolete on the day it is passed. Second, it will hurt consumers, students, teachers, workers, shareholders, and the economy. if Congress had helped set up the automobile industry, there still might be a livery stable in every town, and buggy whip factories in large cities. America's dynamic, world-leading computer industry must be kept free of regulation by slow-moving federal bureaucrats who cannot possibly understand or keep pace with the most dynamic sector of the economy.Taken together, these developments highlight the need for Congress to step back and draft with care the necessary legislation to extend copyright protections to those who develop content for the digital age, instead of blindly racing ahead to enact a Clinton Administration proposal supported by major Hollywood interests.Consider the consequences. Last year, Americans purchased 11 million PCs and 16.8 million VCRs. This year, another 12.6 million PCs and 16.6 million VCRs are expected to be purchased in the United States. These devices enjoy great popularity. At least one VCR is found in 90 million homes and at least one PC is found in 42 million homes, specifically because of the convenience, entertainment and efficiency they bring. They are popular precisely because they are useful and technologically advanced. Nonetheless, a House subcommittee specifically rejected an amendment that would have assured consumers access to the next generation of these products.This isn't the first time someone has tried to stop the advance of new technology. In the mid 1970s, for example, a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block the introduction of the Betamax video recorder. At that time, representatives of Hollywood declared that the VCR would destroy their business. They could not have been more wrong. Last year video tape rentals accounted for a $16 billion portion of the entertainment market. Indeed, people in the movie industry have stated that video sales often make a movie profitable, and some movies are produced exclusively for the home rental market. The movie industry has not learned from history. The same doomsayers are at it again, decrying the lawful use of products by consumers. Their rhetoric has been updated for the digital age, but their message remains the same.This is an important debate that is currently taking place in the Congress and that is the discussion regarding how best to update the copyright laws for the digital age. In particular, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues two significant developments that occurred in the last weeks, and to urge you to join as cosponsors of S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act of 1997.In order to help focus the debate on the best way to update the copyright laws for the digital era, I introduced S. 1146 in September. This legislation is a comprehensive effort to address three broad areas of critical importance to the future of the Internet: (1) the scope of copyright liability for on-line and Internet service providers; (2) the use of computers by teachers, librarians, and students to foster distance learning opportunities and to promote the preservation of important historical works and resources; and (3) the proper implementation of two international copyright treaties. Subsequently, Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Campbell introduced a similar comprehensive bill in the House (H.R. 3048) to foster the growth of the Internet for the benefit of everyone in society.Two important developments took place in the past two weeks that underscore the importance of a comprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws. First, on February 25th, 40 distinguished professors of intellectual property law and technology law said in a letter to the Chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees that they believe these two bills, S. 1146 and H.R. 3048, ``taken together, would bring U.S. law into compliance with the WIPO treaties while preserving the principle of balance which is at the heart of the American copyright tradition.'' They went on to say: ``At this crucial moment in the history of American intellectual property law, it is important that Congress do neither too much nor too little to bring copyright law into the digital era. In our view, the Ashcroft-Boucher-Campbell bills get the balance right.''Second, just one day later, in a major blow to consumers and the high-tech community, a House subcommittee voted out legislation that would make it illegal to produce or even possess future generations of VCRs and personal computers. Faced squarely with the question of whether the next generation of products found in virtually every home in America should be deemed unlawful ``circumvention'' devices, a majority of the subcommittee voted for the interests of copyright owners over the interests of consumers and the computer companies that have done so much to make our country the technology leader of the world.The Subcommittee vote endangers both the liberties that consumers now enjoy and the vitality of the technology industry, which has been the premiere engine for growth in the United States. This approach also suggests the tendency of Congress to ``fix first, ask questions later.'' The bill demonstrates the dangers of fixing what we do not understand. Now is the time to draw a bright line against federal regulation of the computer industry. Washington must not start down the road of dreaming up regulations to fix problems that may or may not exist.I think it useful to recall what the Supreme Court had to say in ruling for consumers and against two movie studios in that case:``One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of the millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program for later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copying possible.''As someone who filed an independent brief in the Supreme Court as the Missouri Attorney General in support of the right of consumers to buy that first generation of VCRs, I want to reassure consumers across the country that I will fight against legislation that would ban the next, exciting generation of technology.What kind of a bill should we consider? One that looks to the future. Above all, one that maintains the balance the professors of intellectual property and technology law have reminded us is at the core of our great copyright tradition and protection of property. The House subcommittee bill would make it all but impossible for someone to make a fair use of a copyrighted work, even though a fair use exception has been a fixture of copyright law from the beginning. What is more, the bill would actually make it illegal to make a copy of a portion of a protected work for fair use in certain circumstances. This is not balance. This is a blank check payable to Hollywood.Unlike the bill starting to move through the House, S. 1146 will spur technological innovation in small entrepreneur workshops and clean-room factories; it will create new educational opportunities in brick schoolhouses and family living rooms; and it will help preserve deteriorating manuscripts in your local library and the nation's largest universities.The Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act will encourage the use of computers and other new high-tech products to foster educational opportunities for everyone from children to senior citizens. Twenty-two years ago, Congress recognized that television could connect teachers in one part of town to students in another part of town. Today, technology has moved forward and has provided this country with fantastic new opportunities. We need to update the law so that schools may use computers to bring the world into the classroom and the classroom into the home.This legislation will ensure librarians and archivists may use the latest high-tech equipment to preserve deteriorating books, manuscripts, and works of art for future genrations to enjoy. New digital technology can enhance the educational experience and preserve our shared culture and history far into the future. Library patrons and students shouldn't be consigned to outmoded equipment when exciting new digital products are on the horizon.S. 1146 will guarantee that the centuries-old ``fair use'' rights of students, library patrons, scholars, and consumers will continue to be recognized in the new digital era of the Internet.In addition the legislation will encourage personal computer manufacturers and software developers to create new products which promote the productivity of Americans across the country. Innovators shouldn't be threatened with criminal penalties for bringing exciting new products to market. Instead, they should be encouraged to develop new products that will add enjoyment and convenience to our lives, while creating good new jobs for American workers.Finally, we will encourage the growth of the Internet by eliminating the threat of certain copyright infringement lawsuits that telephone companies, service providers, and others face in helping consumers connect to the World Wide Web.Technology won't stand still. We need to move forward with the consideration of copyright legislation that promotes new technology, while protecting intellectual property rights. In doing so we must be diligent in looking to the future, not to the past, or to interests that would halt innovation to serve their own parochial concerns.At this critical juncture in history, we need to be sure we get it right. We can only do so by maintaining the balance that has served our country so well and for so long.,2015-03-17 19:11:56.981347,2015-03-17 19:11:56.981347,Senate,ADVOCACY OF THE DIGITAL COPYRIGHT CLARIFICATION AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION ACT OF 1997,1998-03-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-11/html/CREC-1998-03-11-pt1-PgS1770-5.htm,25,0,144,S1770-S1771,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2960,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, Gen. George Patton, as vigorous a proponent of advanced military technology as ever served in the U.S. Armed Forces, once said, ``Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by people.''Today, in the last of three speeches I am making on the future of the U.S. military, I want to talk about the most important resource that the Nation has in protecting its security: Our people, the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces and the civilians who support them.As I have emphasized in each of my previous speeches, under the Constitution it is Congress' responsibility to ensure that U.S. forces are able to carry out their duties. Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to raise and support armies; to provide and maintain a Navy; and to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces.Unfortunately, Congress has not always fulfilled its responsibility to provide for the common defense. Too often in the past, indeed perhaps most often in this century, the United States has been unprepared for the military challenges it has faced. As George C. Marshall lamented in a 1923 speech that I quoted earlier, immediately following a war, Congress and the public remember the terrible price paid by young Americans at the start of a war for which we were unprepared. But very soon thereafter, under the weight of the public debt, the costs of war are forgotten and military strength is allowed to erode.In earlier speeches, I discussed military strategy and defense budgets. In those statements, I said, first, that the strategy which appears to be emerging from the Quadrennial Defense Review or QDR that is now underway in the Pentagon appears to be correct and appropriately broad and demanding.I said, second, however, that the resources that the QDR anticipates to be available appear inadequate to support the strategy. I am concerned especially that the QDR will require reductions in active duty troop levels, and I do not feel that any reductions are warranted in view of the demands on the force. I am even more concerned that this round of force cuts will be followed by a perpetual cycle of budget shortfalls and additional cuts in the future, unless defense budgets grow modestly over time.Those are critically important issues, in large part because of how they bear on the matters I will discuss today. An ambitious strategy accompanied by inadequate resources is a prescription for placing tremendous strain on the people who serve. As it has been said, all of the money for defense that Congress may provide, all of the weapons that the services may buy, all of the logistics infrastructure that may undergird the force, all of the military doctrine that strategists may pronounce, all of the campaign plans that commanders may devise, all of these things ultimately come down to a single soldier walking on point.It is also true, as a corollary, that the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces deserve material and moral support sufficient to allow them to do what we ask of them. In peacetime, however, we most often forget the costs of war and neglect to pay the price of peace. Sometimes I worry that this tendency to forget those who wear the uniform is inherent in a democratic society.The famous British poet Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem entitled ``Tommy,'' about the treatment of soldiers in time of peace. It is written from the point of view of a British infantryman dressed in his red coat who was refused a pint of beer in a public house, and he complains:Like the British public a century ago, we Americans, too, have loudly cheered the troops coming home from war, only to turn away from these troops when the garlands of victory are no longer fresh. Remember the yellow ribbons that were so prominent during the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990 and 1991? Recall the welcome home parade for our victorious troops? I fear that those moments of pride and glory are no longer in the consciousness of most Americans or of this Congress.Today, I want to focus our attention on the men and women who serve, but I want to do it with some care. In assessing how we treat our people, I am torn between two strong feelings. On the one hand, I am concerned that the pressures we are putting on servicemembers and on DOD civilians are growing to the breaking point. On the other hand, I do not want to discourage those who are willing to serve either from joining their Armed Forces or from staying in. On the contrary, and all I will say, I hope to encourage those who are willing and able to serve their country.The fact that we are now at peace and that no single great enemy threatens us does not mean that military service is any less necessary or any less to be valued than in the past. On the contrary, the burden of maintaining the peace lies on the shoulders of those who serve, and it is no less critical a mission than any soldier, sailor, marine, or airman has ever had before.So though I am going to discuss at length all of the problems that those who serve may encounter, I do not want to dishearten the patriotic people that the mission of defense requires.Mr. Speaker, one of the things that most impressed me and many others about former Secretary of Defense Perry was his focus on people. When he first became Secretary, one of the things he did most was to travel to military bases around the country, indeed, all around the world, and talk to the servicepeople he met there; management by walking around, he called it.As a result of this walking around was the persistent emphasis he put on improving the quality of life in the military. For those of us who had known William Perry for many years to be a hardware expert, his focus on people was an unexpected side of his character that was greatly welcomed.The value of Secretary Perry's focus on people was, above all, the message that it sent to the troops. I can tell the Members that it was noticed throughout the military and did much to prevent an unbridgeable rift from opening between the civilian leaders of the Clinton administration and the men and women in the Armed Forces.The example of Secretary Perry's focus on people is one that those of us in policymaking positions should take to heart. The U.S. military is a complex human culture, and its human dimensions must always be considered in making choices on strategy, budgets, programs, social rules, and regulations, or any other aspect of policy.In retrospect, therefore, I believe it was a mistake that the Quadrennial Defense Review did not include a separate panel on people. As many of my colleagues are aware, the work of the QDR has been carried out by six panels on strategy, force structure, modernization, readiness, infrastructure, and a late addition, intelligence, with an integration panel linking it all together.As I have been thinking recently about the issues that the QDR is addressing, so many of them, it seems to me, come down to people. Many people issues are integral to the work of the QDR's six panels. What stresses and strains are put on people by the strategy, given the force structure available to implement it? How does the quality of life in the military affect readiness to carry out missions?How does military training, education and leadership development affect the military's ability to exploit new technology effectively? How will reductions in the defense infrastructure affect the morale of people in the services and of the civilians who support them?All of the QDR panels, therefore, will touch on people to some extent, but not as an explicit focus of attention. Moreover, many critically important people issues may not be addressed at all in the QDR. Do the people in the military have a clear sense of the manner in which the jobs they do contribute to the common defense? How are all the changes in the society as a whole affecting the military, changes that include increasing opportunities for women, the growing proportion of two-earner households, the problems of sexual harassment, the dynamics of race relations? Is there, as many fear, a growing gap between the culture of the U.S. military and of that civilian society, and how will this affect public support for national security and the willingness of many people to serve?The Quadrennial Defense Review will probably not address these questions; and yet, in the end, such matters have as much to do with national security as the size of the budget or the quality of new weapons technology. So in this speech, I want us to focus on the people who protect our national security and to raise some questions which I think need to be considered as Congress evaluates the forthcoming Quadrennial Defense Review.Above all, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that if pressures on U.S. military forces do not ease, then the military will begin to lose many of its best and brightest people. Those I have talked to in the services most often cite three reasons why good people leave the force: First, because the operational tempo is too high; second, because of concerns about their families; and, third, because of uncertainty about the future.In the remainder of this speech, I will address each of these concerns. Certainly, the most immediate people issue on the agenda is how current demands in the force are affecting the troops. Two years ago, Lt. Gen. Ted Stroup, the Assistant Army Chief of Staff for Personnel, was asked what it was like for soldiers who served in an Army that was then composed of 520,000 active duty personnel. Soldiers, he said, were ``stretched and stressed'' by all the demands being put on them. He was asked what the effect would be when the numbers dropped to 495,000, as was then planned. He answered, ``stretched and stressed all the more.''Recently, however, the Department of Defense has proposed reducing the size of the Army to 475,000, which the Army has resisted. Meanwhile, the actual strength of the Army has eroded to about 490,000, even though the official end-strength target required by current law remains at 495,000. It is widely reported that the QDR will reduce Army end-strength by 15,000 or more. So Army people will be stretched and stressed even more. At what point does all this stretching and stressing reach the breaking point?Each of the other services has to face the same issues. Recently a senior Navy official testified at length before the Committee on National Security about the difficulty the Navy has had keeping forces on station as much as it had planned. In large part, this is because the Navy, to its credit, rightly tries to limit overseas deployment to 6 months and puts other constraints on the amount of time units may be away from home. In the same testimony, however, the official had to defend the decision to reduce the Navy's end-strength by 11,000 in order to find money for equipment maintenance.The two issues cannot be separated. As end-strength declines, you can either increase personnel deployment times, which is damaging to your people and which the Navy has correctly refused to do, or you can reduce deployments, which means you are not fully supporting the military strategy.In the other services, and in the Army especially, the ability to limit deployments is not as great. Requirements for Army personnel are driven by overseas duty tours and by the increasing number of military operations, which are not as easy to limit as the number of ship days on station. As a result, too many people in the Army are being stretched and stressed individually by the demands of military operations.For those of us who spent any amount of time out talking to people in uniform, this message comes across very loudly. I spent the Thanksgiving weekend last year on a trip to visit United States troops in Aviano, Italy, Bosnia, and Hungary. In Hungary, I spent some time with soldiers from Missouri, and I recall asking each of them how many military deployments they had been involved in during recent enlistment periods. Several had two deployments, a few had three, and one sergeant had five deployments.Every time I visit the troops, I hear similar stories. As a result, I have been thinking about the extent of the problem, its causes and its solutions. I am convinced, first of all, that the extent of the problem is not adequately identified by current measures. As I said, the Navy has in place a set of rigid limits on unit deployments abroad. Even in the Navy, however, the pace of deployment for individual personnel is not directly measured and limited. In other services, there is no systematic, effective way to measure the extent of individual deployments. So we really do not know how much stress we are putting on individuals in uniform.One of the things the QDR should have considered, therefore, is how to measure the strain put on individuals in the uniformed services and means of controlling it. I have recently seen a draft list from the Air Force of some things we should be measuring. It includes:How many people have temporary duty assignments of less than 90 days a year, 90 to 120 days, or over 120 days a year? If too many people are being deployed away from home on a constant basis, that is a sure sign of an excessive operating tempo.What is the average duty week for people on their assignments? 40 to 45 hours a week; 45 to 55; or over 55? Some jobs require long hours, but if the trend over the whole force is up over time, that is also a cause for stress.How many aircraft crews receive waivers of training hour requirements? If the trend is up, then too many people are being asked to do too many other things besides their primary jobs.How many major exercises are people engaged in, on average, per year?How many people are delayed in meeting training qualification requirements for position upgrades?What share of enlisted personnel are pursuing college degrees and what share of officers are pursuing advanced degrees? What share of each disenroll from course work? A decline in the number of people pursuing advanced education is a good measure of stress on the force.How many people have accrued leave exceeding 60 days?How many fathers have missed a child's birth due to a temporary duty assignment? How many have been assigned to duty away within 30 days of a child's birth?The list goes on, and I could add to it. I am convinced, just by talking to people, that measures such as these will show a dramatic increase in the tempo of work in all of the services. Unless we get a handle on the degree of strain we are putting on the force, and do some things to control it, then we are heading for real trouble in retaining good people.What are the causes of such apparent problems? To me, the root cause is a tendency to underestimate how much is required to carry out military operations while still preparing adequately for full scale war. After all, it is the military's main mission to fight and win America's wars. In the past, the military services did not worry very much about the impact that smaller scale military operations would have on the force, first, because the cold war era force was relatively large, so a small deployment was not felt, and, second, because smaller military operations were relatively rare. That is the main reason why measures of stress on the force are inadequate.Now the force is smaller, and military operations have become more frequent and also, often, of very long duration. One calculation in this year's Army Posture Statement is striking. Over the 40 years from 1950 through 1989, the Army was engaged in 10 deployments. In the 7 years between 1990 and 1996, the Army was engaged in 25 deployments. Meanwhile, the size of the Army has declined by a third and the budget has dropped by 39 percent.Les Aspin's bottom-up review of 1993 did not come to grips with the impact of a larger number of operations on a smaller force. The bottom-up review simply assumed that a force designed to fight 2 major regional conflicts would be large and diverse enough to handle any number of smaller operations. Only now are the services beginning to understand why such a cold war way of thinking will not do.The Army, for example, now has a way of assessing the impact of smaller conflicts that begins to explain the stresses. For each unit deployed in an ongoing operation, the Army says, four units are needed in the force. One unit is deployed. Another unit is preparing for deployment. A third unit is coming off deployment and needs time to restore its readiness. And a fourth unit is depleted because some of its troops were drawn on to fill out the unit that is deployed.Add to this the fact that only a part of the Army is available for deployments, because a portion is undergoing education and skills training, is in transit, or is in support functions and other positions. According to the General Accounting Office, 63 percent of active duty Army troops are deployable at any given time. So out of the 495,000 total, 312,000 troops are available for operations. At the end of 1996, the Army says, 35,800 troops were deployed in operations, mainly in Bosnia. This does not count the number of troops forward deployed in Korea, by the way, who probably ought to be counted as deployed and not simply as forward based. Multiply 35,800 by 4 and the number of troops affected by deployments is 143,200, which is 46 percent of the deployable force. The other 54 percent of the force, of course, is supposed to be training hard to be ready for two major regional wars.Mr. Speaker, this is what has me so concerned about the impact of further reductions in Army force levels. At any one time, a large part of the Army is either involved in operations or is directly affected by them. Already the Army has to draw people away from their normal assignments in order to fill out units that are being employed. To me, this is especially straining for Army people, because such assignments are not planned and often are for temporary duty of 179 days, without any offsetting benefits. Moreover, the people left in the unit from which people were taken away have to work twice as hard to accomplish the workload, which of course does not decline. Now the plan is to further reduce the overall number of personnel without reducing the number of divisions. If the reductions are made from division strengths, then some specialties will have even lower manning levels. If the reductions are made from support positions, which is presumably the rationale, then the opportunity for Army personnel to serve in slots that are somewhat less subject to uncertainty will decline.I do not believe that the Defense Department has an accurate level of understanding of the strains that these further reductions will put on the force. I fear that such reductions will break the force. And, this will be a national tragedy.So how can we resolve these problems? Each of the services has been searching for ways to manage resources to meet the needs, but I am not sure how successful the solutions have been or, if successful from the present, how successful they will remain in the future.One solution has been to use volunteer reservists to fill out deployed units. The key issue here is when we will reach the limit of reserve availability. Reservists willing and able to volunteer have likely come forward already for one duty tour, and enough may not be available in the future. Involuntary mobilization of reservists would soon cause many of them to quit. In addition, mobilization of reservists is expensive. Reservists receive full active duty pay and benefits when they are on active duty. Because Congress insists on offsetting supplemental funding for military operations with rescissions, such costs have to be absorbed within the overall defense budget.Another potential solution may be to reduce nondivision support troop levels in order to fill out division slots. But too often we lose sight of the fact that support personnel carry out assignments that are critical to mission effectiveness.Intelligence, for example, is considered a support function but operations cannot proceed without adequate, timely, usable intelligence. Nor can operations proceed without supplies or medical care or any other basic services provided through support activities.I intend to look very critically at the Quadrennial Defense Review to see how attentive the Defense Department has been to the issue of personnel and operating tempos. I believe there is a vast underestimation of the strain that ongoing smaller scale operations put on the force, that means of measuring the strain are inadequate, and that further force reductions may severely aggravate the problems.The second reason people cite for leaving the force is concern about their families. The U.S. military today is an All-Volunteer Force. Because of this, it is very different from the draft armies of the past. A larger and larger share of the force is composed of people who choose the military as a career, which is a positive trend, because modern, sophisticated weapons and ways of fighting require well-trained, professional people. The professional U.S. military force is the envy of the rest of the world. It sets the standard to which other nations aspire.As a result of this evolution, the force is, on the whole, older than in the past and, most often, married. Today 64 percent of active duty Army personnel are married and, except for the Marine Corps, the proportion is similar in the other services. The modern American military cannot maintain its high quality, therefore, without adequately taking care of military families. The common phrase now is, ``We enlist soldiers, we reenlist families.''Early on in the days of the All-Volunteer Force, we did not do a good job of taking care of families. Military pay levels eroded after the All-Volunteer Force was instituted in 1973. Military housing and other military facilities, following the war in Vietnam, were in awful condition. Social problems that plagued the rest of society, including drug use and racial tensions, also affected the military.Since the late 1970's, attention to the needs of military families has improved dramatically. Pay raises in 1979 and 1980 and much more attention to family needs in the years since then have had tremendously beneficial effects. The military has led the way in responding to social problems; I say this fully aware of some continued shortcomings. The results have been seen in the quality of people recruited into the Armed Forces and the ability to retain good people with the necessary skills.I am concerned, however, that the strains on military families are growing and that we are not doing as good a job as we should in protecting families. To be sure, many of the strains on military families are inherent in the nature of military life. Military personnel are necessarily away from home for extended periods of time. Military families move frequently, which makes it difficult for spouses to build careers, and which itself puts a strain on marriages.These factors make it all the more important that we devote special care and attention to the condition of military families. The most important correction needed is to limit personnel and operating tempos so that military personnel are not away from their families for longer times than necessary.It is especially important that temporary duty assignments away from home be kept within limits. We also need to ensure that military pay keeps up with pay in the civilian sector. I am concerned that pay levels have eroded over time because of the way we calculate pay raises.In addition, we need to be careful to preserve some of the benefits which military families rely on. I am disturbed by proposals to eliminate military commissaries and exchanges. Because of the demands of jobs in the military, I believe it is critically important to assist military families in having access to quality child care. Quality health care for military families must be protected. I think it was a mistake to allow impact aid for schools with military bases to decline as it has. Military families care deeply about education for their children, and we need to ensure that the highest quality education is available wherever they are based.One of the most important initiatives the Defense Department has under taken recently is the effort to improve military housing. While much military housing is very good, much of it is not. I have seen military housing with broken appliances, cracked walls, warped floors, peeling tile, inadequate heat, stopped up drains, and with very poor responsiveness from maintenance staffs. We have to change this and we have to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible.I fear that the QDR will suffer from a major gap if it does not address the quality of life of military families.A third reason people cite for leaving the force is uncertainty about the future. Many military people have been willing to tolerate the stresses that have been placed on the force in recent years because they believe things will get better in the future. If things do not soon get better, however, I am afraid that the best people will throw in the towel and get out of the military.As I noted in this speech on defense budgets that I made a week ago, we have already gone through a defense drawdown that has reduced active duty force levels by about a third. This drawdown has imposed an immense burden on military personnel. It has meant that people have had to move to new jobs much more frequently than before because of the need to replace the large number of people who were leaving. It has imposed this strain on the military education and training system, and often people have started new jobs without complete training. It has made the military personnel system rather brutally competitive, the pressure to force people out means that any single mistake will cost a good soldier his or her career.This has directly affected people's ability to meet their career goals. Officers cannot count on receiving the education they need to advance. The amount of time that officers spend in command assignments, where they really can learn their trade, has declined significantly. Officers used to have 2 years of previous command experience at lower levels before they rose to be battalion commanders. Now they have a year or a year and a half. As a result, we are not adequately seasoning our officers, we are sometimes setting them up for failure, and we are not offering people the command experience for which they joined the force.All of these changes in the force, together with the high operating tempo, have created a great deal of uncertainty about the future. As a result, unless we stabilize the force, unless we pay attention to training and education, unless we allow good people to progress through the ranks in a predictable, fair way, we will discourage the best people from remaining in the force.Already we see signs of good people beginning to leave. It would be wrong to attribute the exodus to external factors. Pilots are leaving in large numbers, many say, because the airlines are hiring again. I will acknowledge that may be a factor but not the main one. The best people in the military services will always be confident of opportunities in the civilian sector. The people we want most to keep in the force are precisely the people who can always find lucrative careers on the outside. The issue therefore is not what lures people out but what drives them to leave.Good people do not sign up for the military as a career because they expect to make a lot of money. They need enough to provide security for their families but they are not going to be lured away by simply higher salaries. If good people are leaving, it is because military service no longer offers them the rewards they expected or because the burdens of service have become too great. If we continue to cut budgets, to reduce force levels, to require people to do more with less, we will drive away the best and the brightest.Mr. Speaker, these are the problems that I believe may in time lead too many good people to leave the force: High operating tempos, eroding support for families, and uncertainty about the future. There are other people issues that the Quadrennial Defense Review should also be expected to address. One is the very broad issue of civil-military relations. While there are many aspects to the issue, I am concerned especially about a potentially growing gap in culture between those who serve in the military and civilian society.We ask a great deal of people in the military. Sometimes, I think, we may expect too much. When we see failures in the military such as evidence of sexual harassment at Aberdeen or in the Tailhook episode, the cultural gap may grow wider unless parties on all sides are careful in their judgments. When issues such as these arise, some within the military react by criticizing civilian society for imposing too much on the military, while some outside conclude that military culture itself is flawed. Both are wrong. Yes, I think there are failures within the military, but I also believe that the military can be counted on to identify and correct its failures. No, I do not think that the military can be exempted from advancing social norms, including requirements for sexual and racial equality, nor do I think that the military is identical to civilian society. Within the Congress, we have a special responsibility to take care of the military personnel from whom we ask so much. We are responsible under our Constitution to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces. It is incumbent upon us therefore not to allow the gap between military and civil society to grow into a gulf.Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 weeks I have delivered three speeches on the future of the U.S. military. In each of these statements, I have called attention to the fact that Congress has often failed in its responsibility to provide for the common defense.I have said that I fear we are again embarked on a course which will leave our forces ill-prepared for challenges to come. More than that, I have argued that failure to maintain military strength will encourage the evolution of new international threats in the future that otherwise would not arise to challenge our security.This is a strong message. It is a sincere message. It is one that, I expect, some of my colleagues will find difficult to accept. I have tried to state it carefully and to explain my reasoning and to use good facts and figures to support my conclusions. Sometimes, however, an argument such as this needs something stronger. I am reminded in this regard of a passage in Gen. Douglas MacArthur's autobiography entitled ``Reminiscences,'' in which MacArthur discussed a meeting he had with President Roosevelt in the late 1930's. At the time, MacArthur was Army Chief of Staff, and he was meeting with the President, along with the Secretary of War, to make an appeal for more defense spending.Secretary Dern, wrote MacArthur, quietly explained the deteriorating international situation and appealed to the President not to economize on the military. Roosevelt, however, was unmoved and reacted to Dern with biting sarcasm. Then MacArthur joined the argument, which became more and more heated. Here is how MacArthur describes what followed:In my emotional exhaustion, I spoke recklessly and said something to the general effect that when we lost the next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spat out his last curse, I wanted the name not to be MacArthur but Roosevelt. The President grew livid. You must not talk that way to the President, he roared. He was, of course, right, and I knew it almost before the words had left my mouth. I said I was sorry and apologized. But I felt my Army career was at an end. I told him he had my resignation as Chief of Staff. As I reached the door his voice came with that cool detachment which so reflected his extraordinary self-control' ``Don't be foolish, Douglas; you and the budget must get together on this.'' Neither the President nor I ever spoke of the meeting, but from that time on he was on our side.Mr. Speaker, I hope that this Congress will not require an appeal like MacArthur's to remember the lessons of the past, that the price of unpreparedness is paid in war. The price of peace is much less.Let us, therefore, treasure those Americans who wear the uniform of our country. Let us appreciate them, encourage them, and care for them. For after all, it is they who bear the burdens of defending that precious American virtue: freedom.,2015-03-17 19:11:57.220518,2015-03-17 19:11:57.220518,House,SPECIAL ORDERS THE FUTURE OF THE U.S. MILITARY,1997-05-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-05-12/html/CREC-1997-05-12-pt1-PgH2477-4.htm,61,1,143,H2477-H2481,S000465,mr. skelton
2961,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, as we look to the future, most of us, in our families, in our businesses, in our civic organizations, in our churches, like to deal with some sort of plan. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of buzz or talk these days about financial planning, making sure we have the capacity to meet the demands of the future when they come to us and when they fall upon us.It is incumbent on the Congress of the United States to engage in some planning, to take a look at the future and find out exactly where we ought to be going and how we ought to get there, and the things that are important and what we ought to do to protect our interests. It is with that in mind that we, the Members of the Congress, are delivering to the President a financial plan for the next decade. He will have an opportunity to act on that plan this week. That plan has been talked about, the tax relief contained in the plan, but it has not been spoken of very generously in terms of the other major features of this financial plan for America for the next 10 years. I think we can only understand the plan by looking at it as a whole, understanding what we are doing to protect the interests of this country in the years ahead.The first thing I think people want us to start to do is to be more responsible in the way we in Washington handle their money. One of the areas of irresponsibility in the past has been the Social Security trust fund. When there has been a little bit more in the trust fund--or a lot more in the trust fund--than was needed for that particular year, Members of the House and Senate have been a part of budgeting that money for expenditures not related to Social Security, to support the operational costs of Government.Americans are duly concerned because they know the reason there is a surplus in the Social Security trust fund is that big bulge of us baby boomers are paying in, but they know when this big bulge of baby boomers starts to consume instead of contribute to the trust fund, we are going to need the surplus. So the first thing we have done in our financial plan for the future is to put an end to that. We are going to stop the practice of spending the trust fund. So the financial plan which will go to the President this week says $1.9 trillion--trillion being a thousand billions and a billion being a thousand millions; I mean, it is almost impossible to think of it that way--$1.9 trillion is going to be reserved for Social Security, a major step forward. Americans have a right to expect us to plan to do that and we are doing it. That is a big part of the financial plan for the future.No. 2, people say over time most families, most organizations want to reduce their debt; they would like to get their debt down to manageable levels. Most of us take 30 years to pay off a home. We have decided to start paying down the national debt. In a part of the plan which I think is very important, we are taking the publicly held debt of the United States of America from $3.8 trillion down to $1.9 trillion, a 50-percent decline in the national debt held by the public of the United States of America. What a tremendous decline in debt. As part of a rational plan, the debt to the gross domestic product ratio goes from 43 percent to 14 percent over that 10-year plan we are sending to the President. First, we protect Social Security. Second, we pay the debt down by 50 percent.No. 3, as the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, has indicated, we put aside about $505 billion for contingencies over the next 10 years, things we might want to spend money on over and above what we are spending now. So not only do we have a reservation of $1.9 trillion for Social Security, not only do we cut the publicly held debt of this country in half, but we also reserve a half trillion dollars for expenditures we are not now making.It is only in the context of these three items--the saving of the Social Security surplus for Social Security; reducing the national debt, the publicly held debt of America, by 50 percent; putting aside a half trillion dollars for contingencies--that we understand what the tax relief is all about. The tax relief is what is left over. Americans earn the money. We trust Americans to earn this money; we should trust them to spend it. The question is whether we are going to fund families or bureaucracies.We got the President to agree with us on saving Social Security to the extent of putting $1.9 trillion aside, and I commend him for getting there. He wasn't there in his State of the Union Message. I commend the President for being willing to pay down the national debt. But the President, after that, wants to spend so much more of what is left over on more Government programs.Frankly, we ought to be giving a tax relief package, 1 percent, to every bracket. We ought to be doing away with the marriage penalty tax. We ought to allow parents and grandparents to invest money so their kids can have money for education, and the growth of that money can have a tax preferred status. We ought to allow people to buy health care in a more tax beneficial way, especially the self-employed who do not get it on their jobs.It is with that in mind I think this package is delivered to the President to say this is a comprehensive financial plan for the future. The tax relief only amounts to 23.8 percent of the total surplus as we have defined surpluses historically because we have been so responsible as to set that Social Security surplus aside. It is not part of what we will spend. And we start to knock down the national debt, take down the publicly held debt of the country 50 percent in the next 10 years and set aside a half trillion dollars for contingencies, and then work on abolishing the marriage penalty and tax, saving for education and expanded IRAs, and knocking every tax rate down by 1 percent--a 1-percent decline for folks at the top brackets and a 1-percent decline for folks at the bottom brackets.It seems to me that is the kind of plan upon which a nation can march forward. I call upon the President of the United States to reevaluate his position. He has expressed real doubts, serious reservations about this. Seeing it in the context of a financial plan for the future of the United States is to see it as a roadmap to opportunity and success and prosperity.I close with this. Because we had the two biggest tax increases in history in this decade, Americans have paid in far more money than we are going to need. It is like going to the grocery store and you hand the man a $10 bill for a $2.45 gallon of milk. You expect change. You expect to get something back when you pay more than is needed for what you have ordered. You would not think much of the grocer who said: I'm going to give you two more gallons of milk and a pound of bacon, whether you need it or not. That is what has happened. The President said we have the Government covered, the costs are covered, but they have overpaid. Now we are going to give them a whole bunch more Government, whether they have ordered it or not.I think we need a little change. Americans deserve some tax relief, and I am pleased to have had this opportunity to present this financial plan which the President should sign.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:11:57.598788,2015-03-17 19:11:57.598788,Senate,TAX RELIEF,1999-09-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-09-13/html/CREC-1999-09-13-pt1-PgS10748.htm,118,0,145,S10748-S10749,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2962,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for their efforts in crafting S. 976, the ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act,'' which reauthorizes programs under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In particular, I want to recognize the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, for his tremendous leadership in drafting this legislation.I am especially pleased that this legislation contains the Charitable Choice provision--modeled after my Charitable Choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law--which will expand the opportunities for religious organizations to provide substance abuse treatment services with SAMHSA block grant funds. This provision is also very similar to language contained in Senator Abraham's legislation, the ``Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act.''While government substance abuse programs have not succeeded very well in helping people break free from addictions, faith-based drug treatment programs have been transforming shattered lives for years by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which change destructive behavior and attitudes.What results have they achieved? We have heard countless stories of the efficiency and effectiveness of these faith-based programs. Teen Challenge has shown that 86% of its graduates remain drug-free. These are individuals who finally broke free of addictions after being routed through a number of government drug treatment programs. The Bowery Mission in New York City has had the most effective free-standing substance abuse shelter in the city-wide system. Bowery also serves its clients at approximately 42% of the cost of some other city-sponsored men's substance abuse shelters. Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, Michigan, named for its former alcoholic founder, has an astounding 70 percent long-term success rate in its faith-based rehabilitation program. According to director Thomas Laymon, government programs leave addicts without ``spiritual support.'' Worse, addicts ``are not held accountable for addictions, and they have no incentive to change their behavior.'' Meanwhile, Trotter Ministries provides guidance, a supportive community, and integration into a life beyond drugs. San Antonio's Victory Fellowship, run by Pastor Freddie Garcia, has saved thousands of addicts in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The program offers addicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, and a chance to provide for themselves and their families. It has served more than 13,000 people and has a success rate of over 80%.USA Today cited a study from Georgetown University Medical Center regarding recovery from opiate addiction. The study found that 45% of those who participated in a religious program were drug-free after one year, while only 5% of those who participated in a non-religious program remained drug-free after a year.Why are faith-based organizations successful? Because they see those they serve as people, not profiles. They come at this with a holistic approach. They address the moral and spiritual cause of the problems rather than simply dealing with the symptoms.While some states may already collaborate with religious and charitable organizations in the area of substance abuse programs, Charitable Choice is intended to expand the use of these partnerships by clarifying to government officials and religious organizations alike what the constitutional ground rules are for these partnerships. If we know that faith-based substance abuse programs are successful in helping people break destructive addictions, government should encourage their expanded use. That is precisely what this legislation does.The Charitable Choice provision in this legislation makes clear that states may direct SAMHSA block grant funds to religious organizations through contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to provide substance abuse treatment services to beneficiaries. The provision reflects our belief in Congress that government should exercise neutrality when inviting the participation of non-governmental organizations to be service providers by considering all organizations--even religious ones--on an equal basis, and by focusing on whether the organization can provide the requested service, rather than on the religious or non-religious character of the organization.Unfortunately, in the past, many faith-based organizations have been afraid--often rightfully so--of accepting governmental funds in order to help the poor and downtrodden. They fear that participation in government programs would not only require them to alter their buildings, internal governance, and employment practices, but also make them compromise the very religious character which motivates them to reach out to people in the first place.Charitable Choice is intended to allay such fears and to prevent government officials from misconstruing constitutional law by banning faith-based organizations from the mix of private providers for fear of violating the Establishment Clause. Even when religious organizations are permitted to participate, government officials have often gone overboard by requiring such organizations to sterilize buildings or property of religious character and to remove any sectarian connections from their programs. This discrimination can destroy the character of many faith-based programs and diminish their effectiveness in helping people climb from despair and dependence to dignity and independence.Charitable Choice embodies existing U.S. Supreme Court case precedents in an effort to clarify to government officials and charitable organizations alike what is constitutionally permissible when involving religiously-affiliated institutions. Based upon these precedents, the legislation provides specific protections for religious organizations when they provide services with government funds. For example, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on the basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based organization also retains its religious character and its control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs.Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious organizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their employment decisions. I have been told by numerous faith-based entities and attorneys representing them that autonomy in employment decisions is crucial in maintaining an organization's mission and character.Charitable Choice also states that funds going directly to religious organizations cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. Government dollars are to be used for the secular purpose of the legislation: providing effective treatment for substance abuse problems.The Charitable Choice provision also contains important and necessary protections for beneficiaries of services, ensuring that they may not be discriminated against on the basis of religion. Also, if a beneficiary objects to receiving services from a religious provider, he has the right to demand that the State provide him with services from an alternative provider.Mr. President, the Charitable Choice provision is truly bipartisan in nature. Shortly after passage of the federal welfare law, Texas Governor Bush signed an executive order directing ``all pertinent executive branch agencies to take all necessary steps to implement the `charitable choice' provision of the federal welfare law.'' And earlier this year, Vice President Gore stated that Charitable Choice should be extended ``to other vital services where faith-based organizations can play a role, such as drug treatment, homelessness, and youth violence.'' The Vice President described why faith-based approaches have shown special promise with challenges such as drug addiction. He said that overcoming these types of problems ``takes something more than money or assistance--it requires an inner discipline and courage, deep within the individual. I believe that faith in itself is sometimes essential to spark a personal transformation--and to keep that person from falling back into addiction, delinquency, or dependency.''Mr. President, I am pleased to say that today we are responding to the Vice President's call for expanding Charitable Choice to drug treatment programs. We are ready to provide people with resources needed to experience a personal transformation and break free from drug or alcohol addiction. Through the bipartisan effort of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we have legislation that will provide greater opportunities to those in our society who are fighting to overcome substance abuse problems.Again, I want to thank Senator Frist, his staff, Chairman Jeffords, and the rest of the Committee for their fine work on this legislation.,2015-03-17 19:11:57.853969,2015-03-17 19:11:57.853969,Senate,YOUTH DRUG AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT,1999-11-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-03/html/CREC-1999-11-03-pt1-PgS13845.htm,153,12,145,S13845-S13861,A000356,mr. ashcroft
2963,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,``Subpart H. Nonrefundable Credit for Holders of Rural Renaissance  By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Talent, and Mr. DeWine):S. 503. A bill to expand Parents as Teachers programs and other quality programs of early childhood home visitation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I introduced S. 503, the Education Begins At Home Act. It is at the desk. It is cosponsored by Senators Talent and DeWine. I invite my colleagues to look at it and join with me in this significant measure to improve early childhood education and development of our children.Parents as Teachers has worked in Missouri. It is a program which involves training and assistance for parents of children from birth to 3 years of age. We have had significant improvements in educational achievements. We have identified problems in children. We have solved problems and saved money by avoiding the necessary, expensive, and very difficult remedial efforts. It involves home visits. It involves bringing children of like age groups together. It works at home. It works for the poorest families. It works for very busy two-working-parent families. It works on our military installations.This measure expands from currently 3,300 children whose parents are in the program nationally to potentially 2.7 million families with young children throughout the United States. The program is presently in all States, in the Union. This expands on it and makes sure we use our early education dollars to the maximum benefit. Get parents involved. Home visits work.Research has clearly shown that the early years are critical in a child's development and lay the foundation for success in school and in life. The home is the first and most important learning environment for children, and parents are their child's first and most influential teacher.Through parent education and family support, we can promote parents' ability to enhance their children's cognitive, language, social-emotional and physical development--thereby helping parents to prepare their children for success in school.It only makes sense to equip parents with the skills they need to help maximize their child's health and development and this is exactly what the Parents at Teachers Program does.The curriculum is designed to build the foundation of later learning, provide early detection of developmental delays as well as health, vision and hearing problems, prevent child abuse and neglect and increase children's school readiness and school success.To achieve these goals, Parents as Teachers provides personalized home visits by trained parent educators, group meetings with other new parents and formal screening of vision and hearing.Twenty-one years ago I pushed the Early Childhood Education Act through the Missouri legislature. During my second term as Governor I signed that ground breaking bill into law which mandated PAT in every school district in the state of Missouri. For me that was the culmination of 5 long years of work.One might say I was on a mission. And I was. Because in 1981, I found myself in a similar situation to that of the Missouri's current Governor. I was about to be a new father myself.PAT certainly made a positive difference in my family. PAT helped us through sleepless nights, teething, and learning the ABC's. My son, Sam, was probably one of the first babies to benefit from the Parents as Teachers materials in Missouri. And countless others have benefited since.What began as an experiment in Missouri has expanded to more than 3,000 sites in all 50 states, and seven foreign countries. Communities all over the world are investing in PAT because the results are positive and the cost is low.Anecdotally, I can tell you that parents in PAT know that it is a tremendous benefit to them and their children.The scientifically sound research shows that: At age 3, PAT children are more advanced in language, social development, problem solving and other cognitive abilities, PAT children score higher on kindergarten readiness tests, Children who participate in PAT score higher on standardized measures of reading, math and language in first through fourth grades, parents who participate in PAT are more confident about their parenting and are more involved in their children's schooling--a key component of a child's success in school.Recognizing that all parents need and deserve support in laying a strong foundation for their child's success I will be introducing the Education Begins at Home Act.To date over 2 million families nationwide have received the education and support they need through PAT. While this is a tremendous accomplishment, there are more families that can be reached by this exceptional program.The Education Begins at Home Act makes a bold federal investment in parents by establishing the first, dedicated federal funding stream to support the expansion of Parents as Teachers--or other home visitation programs--at the state and local level.The $500 million in federal funds over 3 years included in this bill will expand services to over 2.7 million families nationwide.Ten times more families will be served by PAT under this legislation.This bill will: provide $400 million over 3 years to states to expand access to PAT, encourage and foster more collaboration between PAT and Early Head Start Grantees, provide $50 million over 3 years to fund innovative ideas and partnerships at the local level to expand access to PAT in communities with limited English proficiency; and provide $50 million over 3 years to reach more military families by expanding access to PAT in schools and community organizations that serve military families.All babies are born to learn and a parent is a child's first and most important teacher. Parents as Teachers better prepares children for success in school and life and helps parents become more active participants in their child's education. By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):S. 505. A bill to amend the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area Act of 2000 to adjust the boundary of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator McCain to introduce the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area Boundary Adjustment Act. This legislation would amend the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Act of 2000, Public Law 106-319, to reduce the size of the heritage area to conform to the area set forth in the Heritage Area Management Plan approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 2002.The Yuma Crossing Heritage Area was designated in October 2000. It sprung from a preliminary concept plan completed in 1999 by the Heritage Area Task Force. The boundaries proposed in that plan included approximately 22 square miles, extending from the Colorado River on the north and west to the Avenue 7E alignment on the east and the 12th street alignment on the south. These boundaries represented the task force's ``best guess'' as to the cultural landscape warranting inclusion in the heritage area. This ``best guess'' was incorporated into the legislation designating the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area.During the development of the final Heritage Area Management Plan, which was subject to comprehensive community involvement, it became apparent that the area's boundaries were too large and should be more concentrated along the Colorado River and in historic downtown.Rather than simply leave the boundaries as they were set in the 2000 legislation, we have heard from the community in Yuma that it is important that we conform the boundaries to those in the agreed-upon Management Plan. Doing so will provide certainty to the heritage area and those private landowners who live within its current boundaries. It will allow the heritage area to meet its management goals and responsibilities without the worry that private property rights may be affected in the future. By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. Murray):S. 506. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a scholarship and loan repayment program for public health preparedness workforce development to eliminate critical public health preparedness workforce shortages in Federal, State, local, and tribal public health agencies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Durbin to introduce the Public Health Preparedness Workforce Development Act of 2005. This legislation aims to increase the pipeline of qualified public health workers at the Federal, State, local and tribal levels by offering scholarships to students going into the public health field. It also encourages current professionals to stay in the public health field by providing loan repayments in exchange for a commitment of a designated number of years of service in public health.The average age of lab technicians, epidemiologists, environmental health experts, microbiologists, IT specialists, public health administrators and others who make up the public health workforce is 47, seven years older than the average age of the Nation's workforce. Over the next five years, my State of Nebraska will have more public health workers who are eligible for retirement than any other state in the Nation.To encourage young people to enter the public health field, this legislation authorizes $35 million per year for scholarships and $195 million per year for loan repayments. Eighty percent of the funds would be dedicated for state and local public health workers, with bonus payments available to those who agree to be placed in under-served areas.There are critical public health workforce shortages. We cannot afford to lose so many experienced workers just when our public health workforce should be expanding to meet increasing health needs. The ability of the public health system to respond to emerging infectious diseases like West Nile Virus, food-borne illnesses, or bioterrorism relies on a well-trained, adequately staffed public health network at all levels. It is important that we address this problem before it becomes a crisis. By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Voinovich):S. 507. A bill to establish the National Invasive Species Council, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senators Levin, Stabenow, Reed, and Voinovich to introduce the National Invasive Species Council Act--a bill to permanently establish the National Invasive Species Council. I would like to thank my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation.Recognizing the need for better coordination to combat the economic, ecologic, and health threats posed by invasive species, the federal government established the National Invasive Species Council by Executive Order in 1999. Today, the Council continues to operate and develop invasive species management plans. However, the Council is not as effective as it could be. The GAO reported that implementing these management plans is difficult because the Council does not have a congressional mandate to act. GAO further reported that most of the agencies that have responsibilities under the National Invasive Species Management Plan have not been completing activities by established due dates and that these agencies lack coordination. These are significant problems that must be addressed.Invasive species are a national threat that we cannot afford to ignore. Many states are trying to combat these species that are threatening their local environments. Examples of such plants and animals include the emerald ash borer, which has been particularly troublesome in my home state of Ohio; the Chinese mitten crab; and hydrilla, considered to be one of the most problematic aquatic plants in the United States. If left unchecked, these and other invasive species pose dangerous environmental, health, and economic threats. Estimates of the annual economic damages caused by invasive species in this nation are as high as $137 billion. It is clear that more must be done.To combat the serious threats posed by invasive species, we need federal coordination and planning. Our bill would provide just that and on a permanent basis. Under this legislation, the Secretaries of State, Commerce, Transportation, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Interior, Defense, and Treasury, along with the Administrators of EPA and USAID, would continue to work together through the National Invasive Species Council to develop a National Invasive Species Management Plan.The duties of the Council are generally to coordinate federal activities in an effective, complementary, cost-efficient manner; update the National Invasive Species Management Plan; ensure that federal agencies implement the Management Plan; and develop recommendations for international cooperation. Additionally, if recommendations are not implemented, agencies would have to report to the Council. The Council is directed to develop guidance for federal agencies on prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species so that federal programs and actions do not increase the risk of invasion or spread non-indigenous species. And finally, the bill would establish an Invasive Species Advisory Committee to the Council. By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Kohl):S. 508. A bill to provide for the environmental restoration of the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act with my colleague, Senator Levin. I would like to thank him for all of his hard work on this legislation.For those who have seen one of the five Great Lakes, it is not difficult to understand their importance. Covering more than 94,000 square miles and draining more than twice as much land, these freshwater seas hold an estimated six quadrillion gallons of water--or one-fifth of the world's surface freshwater. The Great Lakes ecosystem includes such diverse elements as northern evergreen and deciduous forests, lake plain prairies, and coastal wetlands. Over 30 of the basin's biological communities and over 100 species are globally rare or found only in the Great Lakes basin. The 637 State parks in the region accommodate more than 250 million visitors each year, and the Great Lakes basin is home to more than 33 million people--or one-tenth of the U.S. population.As co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, Senator Levin and I have worked together on legislation and other initiatives to protect this natural resource. We secured funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for water level gauges, a replacement ice-breaking vessel, and funding for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission for sea lamprey control. Additionally, Senator Levin and I met with the U.S. Trade Representative Office in an effort to prevent Great Lakes water from being diverted abroad. We worked to authorize the Great Lakes Basin Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Program in the 2002 Farm Bill, and three years ago, we joined our colleagues in the House to pass the Great Lakes Legacy Act. This legislation provides up to $50 million per year to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to remove contaminated sediments at Areas of Concern.These steps are positive, but we are not keeping pace with the problems facing the Great Lakes--the Federal Government simply is not providing the funding to protect them. An April 2003 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the Federal Government spent roughly $745 million over the last ten years on Great Lakes restoration programs. Now consider that the GAO reported that the eight Great Lakes States spent $956 million during that same ten-year period.There is ample evidence that this current level of commitment is simply not enough to address the challenges. In 2001, there were approximately 600 beach closings as a result of e-coli bacteria. Further, State and local health authorities issued approximately 1,400 fish consumption advisories in the Great Lakes. In 1978, the United States and Canada amended the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement to give priority attention to 43 designated Areas of Concern. Since the signing, the Federal Government has not been able to remove any U.S. sites from the Areas of Concern list. Invasive species are one of the largest threats to the ecosystem and the $4.5 billion Great Lakes fishing industry. There are now over 160 aquatic invasive species threatening the Great Lakes. It is imperative that we fix these problems.For several years, I have been calling for a plan to restore the Lakes. I have been urging the governors, mayors, the environmental community, and other regional interests to agree on a vision for the future of the Great Lakes--not just for the short-term, but for the long-term. It is time for us to come together to develop a plan and put it in place.The bill we are introducing today builds upon the efforts by those in the Great Lakes states who are working with the congressional delegation and federal officials on the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration group. It provides the funding needed to implement their recommendations.This legislation would provide the tools needed for the long-term future of the Great Lakes. First, our bill creates a $6 billion Great Lakes Restoration Grant Program to augment existing federal and state efforts to clean, protect, and restore the Great Lakes. An additional $600 million in annual funding will be appropriated through the EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office. The Program Office will provide grants to the Great Lakes States, municipalities, and other applicants in coordination with the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board. This funding will provide the extra resources that existing programs do not have.While the Great Lakes are a national resource, leaders in the region, not Washington bureaucrats, should set priorities and guide restoration efforts. That is why our bill requires close coordination between the EPA and state and regional interests before grants are released. The Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board, led by the Great Lakes governors, will include mayors, federal agencies, Native American tribes, environmentalists, industry representatives, and Canadian observers. This Advisory Board will prioritize restoration projects, such as invasive species control and prevention, wetlands restoration, contaminated sediments cleanup, and water quality improvements. Additionally, this Advisory Board will provide recommendations on which grant applications to fund. The input from the Advisory Board ensures that regional leaders will be critical in determining the long-term future of the Great Lakes.As the April 2003 GAO study reported, environmental restoration activities in the Great Lakes suffer from lack of coordination. The second goal of this legislation is the codification of the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force to coordinate Federal activities in the Great Lakes region. The EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office would serve as the council leader, and participants would include key federal agencies involved in Great Lakes restoration efforts. The council would ensure that the efforts of federal agencies are coordinated, effective, and cost-efficient.Lastly, this bill would help address a GAO recommendation that a monitoring system and environmental indicators be developed to measure progress on new and existing restoration programs in the Great Lakes.Our bill is a major step in the right direction. I would again like to thank my colleague, Senator Levin, for his dedication to the Great Lakes and to their restoration. We need to continue to refocus and improve our efforts in order to reverse the trend of additional degradation of the Great Lakes. They are a unique natural resource for Ohio and the entire region--a resource that must be protected for future generations. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill and in our efforts to help preserve and protect the long-term viability of our Great Lakes.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act''.Congress finds that-- (1) the Great Lakes and the connecting channels of the Great Lakes form the largest freshwater system in the world, holding \1/5\ of the fresh surface water supply of the world and \9/10\ of the fresh surface water supply of the United States; (2) 30 years after the date of enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), water quality in the Great Lakes has improved, but the Great Lakes remain in a degraded state; (3) evidence of the degraded environment of the Great Lakes includes-- (A) a record 599 closings of Great Lakes beaches in 2001; (B) an increase to 20 percent in the percentage of Great Lakes shoreline that contains polluted sediments; and (C) the issuance by State and local authorities of 1,400 fish consumption advisories relating to the Great Lakes; (4) the Great Lakes are sources of drinking water for approximately 40,000,000 people in the United States and Canada; (5) in the years since the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was signed and the United States and Canada agreed to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the Great Lakes Basin and give priority attention to the 43 designated Areas of Concern'', no sites have been restored in the United States; (6) it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and State and local governments to ensure that the Great Lakes remain a clean and safe source of water for drinking, fishing, and swimming; and (7) while the total quantity of resources needed to restore the Great Lakes is unknown, additional funding is needed now to augment existing efforts to address the known threats facing the Great Lakes.In this Act: (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board established by section 5(a).

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Harkin, and Ms. Cantwell):S. 509. A bill to improve the operation of energy markets; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.Mr. President, in light of the most recent evidence uncovered about Enron's participation in the Western Energy Crisis, I rise today to introduce the Energy Market Oversight Bill with Senators Levin, Harkin, Cantwell and Wyden.This bill would: Improve Price Transparency in Wholesale Electricity Markets. The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to establish an electronic system to provide information about the price and availability of wholesale electricity to buyers, and sellers, and the public.Prohibit Round Trip Electricity Trades. The bill prohibits the simultaneous buying and selling of the same quantity of electricity at the same price in the same location with no financial gain or loss. Round trip or ``wash trades'' are essentially bogus trades whereby no electricity changes hands, but the profit from the trades enriches the bottom-line of a company's financial report.Increase Penalties for Violations of Federal Power Act. Maximum fines for violations of the Federal Power Act are increased from $5,000 to $1,000,000.; and maximum sentences are increased from 2 to 5 years. Current fines are extraordinarily low and therefore provide no deterrence to illegal activity.Increase Penalties for Violations of Natural Gas Act. The bill increases maximum fines for violations of the Natural Gas Act from $5,000 to $1,000,000.Prohibit Manipulation in Electricity Markets. Manipulation is prohibited in the wholesale electricity markets and FERC is given discretionary authority to revoke market-based rates for violations. Strangely enough, manipulation of energy markets is not specifically prohibited. This would add language to Part II of the Federal Power Act.Repeal the ``Enron exemption''. Repeals the Commodities Future Modernization Act exemption for large traders in energy commodities and applies the anti-manipulation and anti-fraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act to all Over the Counter trades in energy commodities and derivatives. In my view, when Congress exempted energy from the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, it created the playing field for the Western Energy Crisis of 2000 and 2001, and cost millions of people millions of dollars.Provide CFTC the Tools to Monitor OTC Energy Markets. For Over the Counter trades in energy commodities and derivatives that perform a significant price discovery function, including trades on electronic trading facilities, the bill requires large sophisticated traders to keep records and report large trades to the CFTC. This does not change the law, only applies the law that exists for futures contracts to over the counter trades in the energy markets.Limit on Use of Data. Requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to seek information that is necessary for the limited purposes of detecting and preventing manipulation in the futures and over the counter markets for energy; to keep proprietary trade and business data confidential except when used for law enforcement purposes. This does not require the real-time publication of proprietary data.No Effect on Non-Energy Commodities or Derivatives. The bill would not alter or affect the regulation of futures markets, financial derivatives, or metals. We have specifically stated on page 20 the following: ``The amendments made by this title have no effect on the regulation of excluded commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.''In addition, the bill states: ``The amendments made by this title have no effect on the regulation of metals under the Commodity Exchange Act.''The Western Energy Crisis of 2000-2001 has still not been resolved. Meanwhile, more and more information about Enron's role in the crisis emerges. On February 3, 2005, the Snohomish Public Utility District released transcripts of tapes showing that on January 17, 2001, Enron traders concocted false repairs for a Las Vegas power plant--making power unavailable that would have been delivered to California--on the very same day that supplies were so tight that Northern California experienced a Stage 3 power emergency and rolling blackouts hit as many as 2 million consumers.By taking the plant offline, Enron was also in direct violation of an Emergency Power Order by U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that required power generators to make power available to California.Telephone transcripts between Enron and the Las Vegas plant confirming the effort to falsify repairs read as follows:Bill: Rich: Ah, we want you guys to get a little creative. Rich: OK. Bill: And come up with a reason to go down. Rich: OK. Bill: Anything you want to do over there? Any---- Rich: Ah---- Bill: Cleaning, anything like that? Rich: Yeah, Yeah. There's some stuff we could be doing.Enron knew exactly what it was doing when it manipulated the Western Energy markets. Enron traders tested gaming techniques in the California market as early as May 1998, creating imbalances in the California market as a result of loopholes it discovered in the system.The schemes the company used in 2000-2001 had already been rehearsed in Canada. ``Project Stanley'' was one such technique--Enron traders inflated energy prices in Alberta, Canada by colluding with other energy marketers.Enron advocated for ``de-regulation'' of California's energy markets while drafting language that was full of loopholes it could exploit. Similarly, the company was the main force behind a provision that exempted it from federal oversight. This exemption, known as the ``Enron loophole,'' was created in 2000 when Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.The loophole exempted energy trading from regulatory oversight and excluded it completely if the trade was done electronically.We must close this loophole in order to prohibit fraud and price manipulation in all over-the-counter energy commodity transactions, and provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the authority it needs to investigate and prosecute allegations of fraud and manipulation.We need to give the CFTC this authority because we learned during the Western Energy Crisis that there was pervasive manipulation and fraud in energy markets, and that FERC and the CFTC were unable or unwilling to use the authority they had to intervene.We need to give the CFTC this authority because we need regulators to protect consumers and make sure they're not taken advantage of.We need to give the CFTC this authority because when there are inadequate regulations, consumers are ripped off.The Western Energy Crisis cost California about $40 billion. California has been asking for $9 billion in refunds. However, given the fact that Enron is in bankruptcy, it would be a miracle if the State receives even half of that amount.Yet there is nothing preventing another energy crisis from happening again, in my State or elsewhere.Therefore, we need Federal oversight of our energy markets.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Talent):S. 510. A bill to reduce and eliminate electronic waste through recycling; to the Committee on France.Mr. President, the pace of technological innovation offers American consumers an eye-catching array of electronic gadgets. But for every new lap top or HDTV that goes home from the store with a consumer, an old computer or TV gets moved to the garage or shoved into the back of a closet. What to do with the growing amount of trash from the digital economy is a question that Senator Talent and I believe must be addressed before our landfills are full and foreign countries close their ports to ships loaded down with old US computers. Today we are introducing bipartisan legislation to jumpstart a nationwide electronic waste recycling initiative.When I was a member of the Commerce Committee, I helped write the ground rules for the digital economy. My goal was to help create a climate that would spur the development of technology so it would become accessible and affordable to all Americans. This approach seems to be working. One measure of the success of the digital economy is the sheer number of computers and electronic gadgets that Americans own. Americans now spend more than $130 billion a year on electronics, from computers to HDTVs.The boom in consumer spending on electronics and the growth in the digital economy are not without a downside. In one year alone, some 60 million computers and 20 million television sets become obsolete and more than 500 million computers will be discarded in the decade ending in 2007. These obsolete computers alone will result in over 6.3 billion pounds of plastic and 1.6 billion pounds of lead in our landfills or incinerators.Electronic waste, or e-waste, is not even a blip on the radar screen of most policymakers. There have been a few news articles here and there, but so far they've been buried, well behind page one. I want to tackle the problem of e-waste in the same way we went about solving the Y-2K problem: putting policies in place to help all stakeholders deal with it before it overtakes us.Some communities across the country have begun to talk about how to deal with the accumulation of electronic waste. A few States, like California and Maine, recently passed laws to get recycling programs going. Several other States, including my own State of Oregon, will likely consider legislation this year. Among the options, some States favor an upfront fee, tacked onto the price of electronics, intended to help pay for the cost of recycling, others are looking at end-of-life fees. No one yet has looked at the approach Senator Talent and I are proposing.My own sense is that slapping a fee on consumers for the purchase of a new computer or television is not necessarily the best way to encourage them to drag those old 80-pound computers and TVs out of the basement and get them to a recycling facility. Someone who needs a new one may just pay the fee but leave their old computers and TVs at home. End-of-life fees mean that today's manufacturers and retailers end up paying for e-trash left over from manufacturers that have gone out of business or from off-shore companies.The bipartisan legislation Senator Talent and I are introducing today, The Electronic Waste Recycling Promotion and Consumer Protection Act, takes a novel approach to the problem.First, to get consumers motivated to move their old computers or televisions out of the garage and to a recycling facility, the bill would give them a one-time tax credit based on showing they gave their old computers or televisions to a qualified recycler.Second, to build up the recycling infrastructure nationwide, the legislation would give manufacturers, retailers and qualified recyclers tax credits over a 3-year period, based on showing that they had recycled a certain amount of e-waste each year and done it in a way that is safe and environmentally sound.Third, the bill would give the Environmental Protection Agency a year to come up with options for a nationwide e-waste recycling program that would, if approved by Congress, preempt State plans. Manufacturers, retailers and recyclers are going to find it increasingly difficult to deal with a crazy quilt of 50 different State e-waste recycling laws.These are the incentives, but incentives without teeth won't work. So at the end of 3 years of tax credits, if EPA determines that there are enough recyclers in place, no one who operates a municipal solid waste facility could knowingly accept any computer, computer monitor or television unless the e-waste is to be recycled.The bill would also ask EPA to consider the benefits of requiring manufacturers who sell computers and TVs to take them back for recycling. And, to make sure we're keeping our own house in order, the legislation would require the federal government to properly recycle its computers.The goal here is to provide incentives to build a nationwide e-waste recycling infrastructure. EPA estimates that electronic waste already constitutes 40 percent of the lead and 70 percent of the heavy metals found in landfills today. If this waste is not handled properly, there is a real risk that toxins from the lead, mercury and cadmium will leach into the air, soil and water. The health effects of these toxins are well known and include an increased risk of cancer as well as harm to kidneys, the brain and the nervous system.As one who has worked so hard to foster the digital economy, I believe there is also a duty to assure that e-waste is handled responsibly. Consumers need to know that potentially harmful e-waste is being handled properly and I can't find a reason to add millions of tons of new toxic waste to our environment.I also believe that the United States, as the leading innovator and consumer of electronic products in the world, has a duty to deal with e-waste responsibly. Sending shiploads full of e-junk that contains harmful lead, mercury and cadmium to poor countries overseas is not my idea of responsible.Senator Talent and I have worked with a group of folks that normally don't see eye to eye on such issues. Through many hours of negotiation they have helped us produce a bill that represents a solid first step toward solving this problem. I am pleased that we have support for the approach taken in our legislation from environmental groups and industry groups, ranging from manufacturers like HP and Intel to retailers and solid waste recyclers, like Waste Management. We are committed to continuing to work with them to move the legislation through Congress.In closing, electronic waste is not going away. It's time to put bipartisan policies in place that will jumpstart the creation of a nationwide e-waste recycling infrastructure so that consumers have access to recycling facilities and get in the habit of recycling these items. I've talked to manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, environmental and consumer groups and they tell me that this issue must be addressed now by a national rather than state-by-state approach. This bill is a common-sense, first step that will help us get a handle on the growing problem of electronic waste.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Waste Recycling Promotion and Consumer Protection Act''.Congress finds that-- (1) the National Safety Council estimates that-- (A) in 2003, over 60,000,000 personal computers became obsolete and between 1997 and 2007 more than 500,000,000 computers will need to be discarded; and (B) at an average weight of 70 pounds, this will result in over 6,300,000,000 pounds of plastic and 1,600,000,000 pounds of lead added to the supply of waste needing to be managed; (2) according to the Environmental Protection Agency-- (A) a computer monitor or television set generally contains 4 to 8 pounds of lead; (B) mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals are generally used in such equipment as well; and (C) households and businesses in the United States often do not discard older computers and televisions when buying newer versions of the same products; (3) according to experts, the average household may have between 2 and 3 older computers and televisions in storage, and approximately 20,000,000 to 24,000,000 computers and televisions are placed in storage each year; (4) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, discarded computer, television, and other electronic equipment-- (A) when not discarded in large quantities, is currently managed in most States as municipal solid waste, just like ordinary trash; and (B) constitute 40 percent of the lead and 70 percent of the heavy metals that are found in landfills and, if not handled properly, can be released into the environment, contaminating air and groundwater and posing a significant threat to human health, including potential damage to kidney, brain, and nervous system function, and cancer in cases of excessive exposure; (5) materials used in computers, televisions, and similar electronic products can be recovered through recycling, which conserves resources and minimizes the potentially harmful human and environmental health effects of those materials; and (6) establishing a nationwide infrastructure for electronic waste recycling will-- (A) facilitate access of people in the United States to recycling services; and (B) improve the efficiency and use of electronic waste recycling.In this Act: (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

2964,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Well, I think that Ronald Reagan, you know, he had a way of putting complicated things in simple words. He said we are buying more government than we can afford. That is not a bad summary of the situation. And it hasn't gotten better since Ronald Reagan was here--we are buying more government than we can afford.I appreciate your historic examples. Of course, there is no way Congress can do the example of the postal roads that you made out when we are trying to basically do everything under the sun, be all things to all people. We are going to have to make some decisions saying this is a nice thing to do, but it could be done by a State government or it could be done by the private sector.We are going to have to make some of those choices and just say, look, there are some things that the private sector and the States cannot do and we better fund that first. Certainly, providing for the common defense is one that has to be up at the front end, because the other governments can't do that, and the individual citizens can't do that. Whereas when it comes to some of the other kinds of things, such as in the energy areas or education or insurance or a lot of those things, they could be done by other governments.When we start to get into this, hey, let's start to do something that feels good about this subject and turn it over to a bunch of administration bureaucrats, we have really lost control of where we are, and I appreciate your bringing us back to ground zero.Now, there have been some shifts. Here is one that is kind of interesting, and it is the tradeoff. They always talk about the tradeoff between guns and butter, between defense and basically welfare programs.If you go back to 1965, the entitlement spending was 2.5 percent of GDP of the overall budget, 2.5 percent in 1965 was entitlement. Defense was 7.4 percent. Now we have shifted to 2010, the estimate is 4.9 percent is national defense. We have gone from 7.4 down to 4.9 percent, while entitlements has gone from 2.5 percent to 9.9 percent in entitlements.That is getting to that area where if the entitlements continue to climb, if you just look at demographics, there will be no money for defense or anything else and the budget will be dominated by just simply Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.So we are going to have to ask ourselves what are the top priorities. We are going to have to fund those and do a good job at those. That is what I was getting at. I don't think we can have the mentality of just saying we are going to take 10 percent out of everything or 30 percent out of everything. I think we are going to have to make some decisions. Some we may not want to cut, we just want to make them more efficient and leave that amount of money in it, and other ones we may say it is not a matter of cutting it, we don't even need the thing at all. Let's just get rid of that entire functional area. That is where we have to be going.But, again, where we started today is the right place, with the U.S. Constitution, and making the key distinctions that the Constitution makes so clear. There is a difference for providing for defense and then basically encouraging general welfare.I appreciate your very specific historic examples. If you remember the name of the book, there was a book, I don't know if it was the same one you were quoting from, but it had examples of those six industries. All of them where the government was in subsidizing the corporations, there was all kinds of corruption and the companies all failed, and the ones that stayed away from government funding were the ones that stayed in business. Just a fascinating study.,2015-03-17 19:11:58.309285,2015-03-17 19:11:58.309285,House,SPENDING CUTS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,2011-01-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-01-06/html/CREC-2011-01-06-pt1-PgH75.htm,2,50,157,H75-H82,A000358,mr. akin
2965,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, one of the many blessings of being a U.S. Senator is the opportunity to be exposed to so many people who strive, work together, and improve their communities and our Nation every day.Despite hardship, America is a place where Americans face challenges as opportunities determined to see that tomorrow is always better than today. One powerful example is the partnership that exists in St. Joseph, MO, between community leaders and the Missouri Western State University. How pleasing it is to have members of the forward-leaning St. Joseph Area Chamber of Commerce led by Ted Allison come to Washington and, as usual, front and center among the distinguished group is the president of the University, Dr. Robert Vartabedian.How powerful it is to have Mr. Allison testify before the House Committee on Small Business, represented by his Congressman and committee ranking member, Sam Graves, and speak passionately about the job-producing power of the small business community such as exists in St. Joseph, and the importance of education to support small business productivity and growth.Dr. Vartabedian, and his predecessor, Dr. James Scanlon, share the view that the University does not exist in isolation but that the University should understand and serve the community just as the community, in this case, the Chamber of Commerce, and others, serve the University.Dr. Scanlon, who retired after 7 years in June of 2008, was a tireless head of the school and advocate for the community. Integrity and intellect served Dr. Scanlon's action-oriented approach which insisted upon customer-based performance. He never rested and he did not allow members of the St. Joseph community to rest either. After all, the community included future employers and neighbors of his kids and Dr. Scanlon was interested in them having productive and happy lives far beyond graduation.Originally a New Yorker, of all things, one would think Dr. Scanlon always lived in St. Joseph and intended never to leave, but his remarkable footprint continued under the current leadership and has provided a foundation for continued vision and performance. ``Oh happy day!'' became his trademark exclamation, and while I hope it was for Dr. Scanlon, I am certain that because of him, it has been for thousands of students and their faculty and community members.In a large part thanks to Dr. Scanlon, and now, Dr. Vartabedian's leadership, Western has thrived, becoming a source of pride for the community, region, and state.Western's statewide mission is applied learning. Remarkably, about 90 percent of Western students completed at least one internship, practica, or faculty-student project by the time they graduate. In other words, Western students have classroom and real-world experience.Since 2001, the college has become a university, experienced its fifth straight year of record enrollments, doubled its laboratory space for sciences, undertaken to fill its capacity at the new Science & Technology Incubator, built up modern math and science capacity, began a new M.S. program in Nursing, became the summer home of the Kansas City Chiefs, and has seen the establishment of the Steven L. Craig School of Business.According to Missouri Western, the gift by Mr. Craig that made the new school possible ``means serious business for Western.''The generosity by Mr. Craig will not only launch another valuable path for students to develop value, but represents a strong endorsement of the Western program, and the sense of community in St. Joseph where Craig was born.Mr. Craig graduated from nearby Savannah High School before moving to California to graduate from the University of Southern California. He founded the Craig Realty Group, a Newport Beach, CA, company that owns and manages 13 upscale factory outlet centers in 6 states.The gift of $5.5 million was one of the very largest in the Nation and the largest individual gift to the university's foundation. In addition to being the largest individual gift to the university, these funds will directly enhance St. Joseph, MO, the Midwest region, and will be used to develop tomorrow's business leaders who should follow not only Mr. Craig's business model, but his model of selfless philanthropy as well. Missouri Western officials recognize that Mr. Craig's gift celebrates three of his qualities: entrepreneurial spirit, generosity, and faith.This conspiracy of goodness by a true working community on behalf of a future community membership is a model to applaud and to emulate. Doctors Scanlon and Vartabedian, Mr. Allison, Mr. Craig and all those who have locked arms with you leaders to plow forward, thank you and well done and, more importantly, well doing. ,2015-03-17 19:11:58.592490,2015-03-17 19:11:58.592490,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2010-04-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-04-15/html/CREC-2010-04-15-pt1-PgS2372-2.htm,53,0,156,S2372-S2373,B000611,mr. bond
2966,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, when I am home in Missouri, the folks I talk to frequently express their concerns about the economy and jobs. According to the most recent data, 27,630 people in the Fourth District are without work. Families whose breadwinners have lost work and others who fear unemployment must continue to be a priority of this Congress.Jobs allow for American families to feel secure in their homes. Jobs stimulate economic activity in our home towns and throughout our country. Jobs generate tax revenue for city, state, and federal governments, which help policy makers pay the bills and reduce the deficit. Jobs are essential to breaking out of the Great Recession.This year, Congress has been working on several jobs bills. One bill known as the HIRE Act, which is now the law of the land, provides tax relief to small businesses and expands important highway projects. Other legislation on which Congress has been working include bills to provide additional small business tax relief, to expand lending opportunities for small businesses, and to stimulate small business growth and expansion.Today, the House of Representatives is considering H.R. 4213, a bill that would create additional jobs in our country by cutting taxes for American families and businesses and by spurring new infrastructure improvements. It would also take care of American veterans by eliminating the so-called disabled veterans tax for two years, would provide American farmers with tax relief and emergency disaster assistance, and would extend emergency assistance to American families.H.R. 4213 is supported by Farm Bureau, by veterans, by small businesses, and by AARP.For Missouri farmers, H.R. 4213 would extend the five-year depreciation for farming machinery and equipment, would extend the charitable tax deduction for donated food, and would extend the tax deduction for donating conservation easements. H.R. 4213 would also extend critical tax incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel. The biodiesel tax credit is very important to the development and sustainability of America's renewable fuel industry. H.R. 4213 would also provide emergency financial assistance to farmers for qualifying 2009 agricultural losses. For these reasons, today's legislation has been endorsed by the Farm Bureau and the National Biodiesel Board.For America's veterans, H.R. 4213 would allow many military retirees who are also disabled veterans to receive both Department of Defense military retirement pay and VA military disability pay for the next two years. Often referred to as the disabled veterans tax, finding a legislative solution to the concurrent receipt issue has been a top priority of our nation's veterans and of Congress. I have worked on the House Armed Services Committee to end the disabled veterans tax and am pleased that H.R. 4213 will provide full retirement and disability benefits to 77,000 of these disabled service members for two years. Its passage is a critical first step toward extending concurrent receipt to all 136,000 medically retired veterans over four years. Because of the bill's positive impact on veterans, it has been endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America, MOAA.For Missouri businesses, H.R. 4213 would allow credit to flow more easily to small businesses through popular and effective SBA lending programs, would extend the research and development, R&D, tax credit that encourages financial investment and job creation in America's high tech sector, would allow corporations to receive a refund of a portion of their alternative minimum tax credits if they invest during 2010 in capital equipment for use in the United States, would extend the 15-year cost recovery for qualified improvements to restaurants and retail space, and would extend benefits for investments in economically distressed areas of our country. Because the business provisions included in H.R. 4213 are so very important, the bill is supported by the National Restaurant Association, the Independent Community Bankers Association, and the National Retail Federation.For Missouri families, H.R. 4213 would provide important tax relief. The bill would extend for one year tax deductions for qualified college education expenses. It would extend a special deduction for teachers and other school professionals who use personal funds to buy school supplies for their classrooms. And, the legislation would ensure activated military reservists do not suffer a pay reduction by providing a tax credit for small businesses that continue to pay National Guard and Reserve employees when they are called to active duty.For Missouri's senior citizens, military personnel, military retirees, and people with disabilities, H.R. 4213 would ensure they are able to continue seeing the doctor of their choice by preventing a 21 percent reduction in Medicare and TRICARE physician fees. Without making these changes, doctors in Missouri and elsewhere would likely not continue to see Medicare and TRICARE patients. That is why H.R. 4213 is supported by AARP and MOAA.H.R. 4213 would extend other valuable provisions of the U.S. tax code, including deductions for charitable contributions by individuals and businesses, would provide for important pension relief sought after by the Missouri Rural Electric Cooperatives, would provide emergency assistance for American families who are impacted by unemployment, would create summer jobs for American youth, and would allow for state and local governments to finance the reconstruction of schools, sewer systems, and hospitals through Build America Bonds and Recovery Zone Bonds--work that would create thousands of jobs across our country. Because infrastructure improvements are so vital to jobs, H.R. 4213 has been endorsed by our nation's mayors and county governments.The non-emergency spending associated with H.R. 4213 is compliant with the PAYGO law enacted earlier this year. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4213 so that we can provide tax relief to American families, farmers, and businesses, can take care of America's veterans and senior citizens, and can create small business jobs.,2015-03-17 19:11:58.838662,2015-03-17 19:11:58.838662,Extensions,TAX EXTENDERS ACT OF 2009,2010-06-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-09/html/CREC-2010-06-09-pt1-PgE1047.htm,86,0,156,E1047,S000465,mr. skelton
2967,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I promised the gentleman that we did have a chart that was taking a look at these foreign countries. We've taken a look at Greece, and Greece has been in the news because it has just created shock waves in Europe as to how it has been affecting their economic system.This is the deficit as a percent of GDP. I mentioned that, as to where we are in the United States, which is at that $1.4 trillion level that we just saw last year and at another even higher year this year, we are at about a 10.3 deficit as a percent of GDP. Greece is at 9.4. So our deficit, as a percent of GDP, is worse than that of Greece. Spain and the United Kingdom seem to be worse off than we are, but we are the next worse on this chart with regard to the deficit.If you go to debt as a percent of GDP, you've got the United States here. Greece is ahead of us there, and Italy is ahead of us, but we're ahead of the other European countries as well. So this isn't exactly a cheery picture of the job we should be doing in terms of management.We are coming close on time here, and I have one other chart here, which is that of our corporate tax rates. The green one over on the right is the second highest corporate tax of any nation in the country.So what's the solution?I promised we'd deal a little bit with solution. The solution is quite simply that you've got to cut spending and that you've got to cut taxes. If the Democrats could not learn from Ronald Reagan or from Bush when they cut taxes and restored the economy, they should learn from JFK, who did the very same thing. Here is an example of this. It's called the ``Laffer curve.'' You can see that this red is the tax rate. As the tax rate comes down, the bar chart shows the total Federal savings in receipts, so we actually get more revenues in. When you drop taxes, you get more revenue.So the solution has been demonstrated by JFK, by Ronald Reagan, and by Bush. They turned economies around. Instead of doing what FDR did, which is what Henry Morgenthau told us would not work, you can simply do this: what you do is you've got to drop the tax rate and drop government spending. The trouble with dropping government spending is you can't do giveaways to everybody and do bailouts to everybody.So what's going to happen here?America is in the cross-hairs of a choice. We're either going to choose to follow--because there are two U.S.s: one U.S. had the idea that government is going to provide health care and education and jobs and food and housing. The other U.S. said that we believe the job of government is to provide life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That is a very narrow description of government--just national defense and a level playing field. Those are the two U.S.s. The one is, of course, the USSR, and that system didn't work. The other is the one that has worked for hundreds of years.We need to get back to that idea of a limited government, doing just what it is supposed to do constitutionally and not try to be the bailout king of the entire world and of the entire country.I thank my good friend, Congressman Gingrey from Georgia, for your insight, and not only your medical professionalism but the way that you've run your office. And the same thing for my good friend from New Jersey, Congressman Garrett. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.Good night, and God bless all of America.,2015-03-17 19:11:59.097852,2015-03-17 19:11:59.097852,House,LESSONS FROM THE PAST,2010-06-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-14/html/CREC-2010-06-14-pt1-PgH4409.htm,88,40,156,H4409-H4416,A000358,mr. akin
2968,MO,Todd,Akin,R,The point you bring up, gentlemen, I was not a Boy Scout, but we had a bunch of boys that were Boy Scouts. And one of the things that they learned, which we did, because my wife and I were outdoors people and did a lot of backpacking and canoeing and all, is that when you come to a campsite, you always want to leave it better than the way you found it. It was just sort of like a tradition among outdoorsmen. And that tradition very much reflected the mindset of my parents' generation, the people that fought World War II. My father is 89 and was with Patton in the Army.But there was a general way of thinking in that generation. And the mindset was that they were going to sacrifice a lot of things they wished they'd had as kids in order to give their kids something better. They're going to leave the campsite better than it was left for them.And so my parents' generation, if they made a mistake, it was they tended to spoil us. They tended to give us everything we wanted, whereas they had had to really--the other generation, they might not have had a college education but said, My son is going to be a doctor. My son is going to be an engineer. I'm going to make sure they have enough money to go to college, which I didn't have a chance to do. And that was their mindset. And that's what breaks my heart about such a boring subject as budgets is because of the fact that we're not following--we're leaving that campsite look like a dump truck full of litter just got dumped on it. We're leaving litter that our kids can't pick up, our grandchildren won't be able to pick up. And that's just wrong. And it is not the American way.And yet what's it spring from? Our own selfishness politically that we have to appease--which is wrong in the first place. It's theft and we're going to steal money from a lot of people that aren't even alive yet and we're going to spend it and hand it out to people. And that's a sad place to be in.So we're doing two things. So we're increasing taxes radically, but we're increasing spending even more. The ironic thing is that when you increase taxes, you also kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs and you start to take in less revenue.Here's a list of some of them. This cap-and-tax bill that we passed. This thing is supposed to be about global warming. It's supposed to be about reducing CO. The only thing this thing does is create more taxes and more government regulation and probably more CO to boot. If they wanted to stop CO--if people were honest about stopping CO--let's assume you're a greenie and that your CO is really bad and we've all got to stop breathing. How are you going to do it? You're just going to double the number of the nuclear power plants and you wipe out all the equivalent of all the CO burned by every passenger car in America. But that's not what this bill does. It supposedly is about global warming, but in fact it's just more taxes.222222And the health care tax thing. This deal here, that bill, they had to struggle to keep it under a trillion dollars. The President said, I won't do it if it costs a dime. No. He did it because it costs more than a trillion. So there's another great big tax. Death tax. Capital gains. They're going to expire. So we're going high in taxes. But does that mean we're cutting back on spending? No.This, my friend, is why if I were a Democrat I wouldn't want to put a budget out there. Take a look at that picture.

2969,MO,William,Clay,D,I want to thank my colleague from Utah for promoting an awareness of cancer screening.Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the chief sponsor of this legislation, and one of the most courageous colleagues we have because she is a survivor, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).Thank you, Chairman Clay, for your very kind remarks.Congressman Chaffetz, thank you very much for taking the lead on your side of the aisle. Let me just express the grief that I know you felt for the loss of your mother. I have shared that grief with so many women since I shared my own personal story, and hopefully the resolution that we have today will raise awareness so that we can continue to catch more cancer earlier so that we can have more survivors in the United States.Let me also commiserate with you on the pre-50 experience that I had for a colonoscopy, which wasn't any fun, but is absolutely necessary. Thank you for mentioning that too, although we all will spare the gory details for everyone. Suffice it to say that it's not a fun experience, but one that is very necessary.But I rise today to offer H. Res. 1522, expressing support for designation of the last week of September, this year being the week of September 26, as National Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Week and the last Wednesday of September as National Previvor Day.Of all the cancers that affect women, roughly 10 percent of cases are caused by genetic factors. Though this percentage is relatively small, the risk for this group, as you have just heard, is huge.Women with hereditary risk factors for breast cancer carry an 85 percent lifetime risk of developing the disease. For ovarian cancer, most women have about a 1.5 percent lifetime chance of developing the disease. But for those with hereditary risk factors, that chance can be as high as 50 percent, and as I learned almost 3 years ago, I am one of those women.Together with my colleagues and inspirational organizations, including Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered, or FORCE; Bright Pink; and the Young Survival Coalition, this resolution gives a voice to these women and brings awareness to the risks of hereditary cancer and, as I have said many times and as so many of my colleagues have said on the floor many times, knowledge is power.Hereditary cancer syndrome describes an inherited gene mutation that increases the risk for one or more types of cancer. The main hereditary breast and ovarian syndromes are caused by mutations in one of two genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2--I am a BRCA2 carrier--which substantially increase the risk for breast and ovarian cancer and slightly increase the risk for other kinds of cancers.For women with a hereditary risk of cancer, it often strikes at an earlier age when they are less likely to expect it, but when the cancer is often more aggressive and more deadly. These young women with a heightened genetic risk are known as previvors, individuals who are survivors of a predisposition to cancer, but who haven't yet had the disease.I was 41 when I discovered that I had breast cancer. Because my cancer was discovered so early, I may have only needed minimal treatment. However, as an Ashkenazi Jewish woman, as a woman of Eastern European Jewish descent, I was at a higher risk of carrying a BRCA mutation, and my early cancer set off warning bells for my doctors.At the time, I did not know of my increased risk for carrying the BRCA gene mutation, but I was fortunate that once diagnosed with breast cancer, I had access to experts that helped me learn more about what the BRCA gene mutation meant for me. Genetic testing confirmed the worst. Unfortunately, I had hereditary cancer which dramatically increased my chances of a recurrence of breast cancer and getting ovarian cancer as well. Facing my disease, I have become both a survivor and a previvor.As a mother of three beautiful children, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to make sure that I would be around to see them grow up. I faced tough choices, but seven major surgeries later, I have dramatically reduced the chances that my own cancer will come back.Fortunately, there are organizations like FORCE, Bright Pink and the Young Survival Coalition that support young women as previvors and as survivors of cancer. These organizations bring essential awareness to these issues and help women at risk by providing the information, support and the voice they need to help survive their hereditary risk. As I said before, knowledge is power.It is also why, with the help of 377 cosponsors in the House, I filed the Breast Cancer Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act, known as the EARLY Act, to bring this message of knowledge and awareness to the forefront of the story about cancer. I am proud that the EARLY Act is now the law of the land.With the odds stacked against them, young previvors need to know their risks. It is our responsibility to empower these women to know their bodies, speak up about their health, and work together to wipe out these deadly diseases.I believe this resolution will help in that effort. National Previvor Day and Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Week, which bridges September's Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and October's Breast Cancer Awareness Month, will bring added public awareness to the risks for genetic cancers. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in support of H. Res. 1522.Mr. Speaker, let me just add, before I close, that I am thrilled to see that our colleague from Connecticut, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who is an ovarian cancer survivor, has joined us on the floor in support of this resolution.,2015-03-17 19:11:59.483120,2015-03-17 19:11:59.483120,House,SUPPORTING DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL HEREDITARY BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER WEEK AND NATIONAL PREVIVOR DAY,2010-09-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-15/html/CREC-2010-09-15-pt1-PgH6700.htm,124,8,156,H6700-H6703,C001049,mr. clay
2970,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I am delighted you made those points. And I have some charts here that have been kicking around my office for 4 or 5 years on the very points you are making because you are so absolutely correct. It seems to me that somehow President Obama and the other leadership here in Congress have forgotten some amazingly simple things, but we make life too complicated sometimes.One thing is the American Dream was not to make rich people poor. The American Dream was about making people who didn't have much money to be richer. Sometimes richer economically, sometimes because they come here without a high school education and watch their kids pick up a college diploma. There are a lot of ways that American Dream works, but it was never to tear people down. It was always to build people up. That seems like kind of a basic idea, but it seems like the focus is we are so worried about somebody being rich that we are willing to melt the economy down just to try to get them. And the funny thing is that people who are very rich have ways of hiding their money, and all you do is hurt a lot of innocent people.The other thing that seems so simple to me is if you are really honestly worried about unemployment and jobs, it seems like the obvious thing is jobs come from employers. And if you destroy employers, how are you going to have jobs? That is not a complicated formula. In Missouri we would say that is kind of a no-brainer; and yet somehow here in Washington, D.C. we make it too complicated. We have a tremendous level of Federal spending, bury people in red tape, mess with their liquidity, create uncertainty in the markets, spend money like mad, and tax all of these businesses, create uncertainty, and then wonder why there aren't any jobs. It doesn't seem like it is that complicated an issue.Getting back to what you said, my good friend, right here, and this is May 2003, there were a series of tax cuts that happened right here in May 2003. The tax cuts was capital gains, dividends, and the death tax. Those are not really popular taxes. When the Republicans passed them, we were criticized, you are trying to do special deals for rich people and blah, blah, blah. The question is when we cut these taxes, the liberals were saying you've spend all of this money because if you cut the taxes, you won't get this revenue that comes in.And that was their reasoning because their mindset is the government owns everything and we're going to let the people who work keep a little bit of it. Well, we did this tax cut, even though it wasn't popular, in May of 2003, and this talks about job creation. I started on the subject of jobs. This is the job creation before and after taxes, and anything that's going down means we lost jobs. Any line that goes up says we gained jobs. Well, here's the tax cut here, and look at this. Look at this graph of the job creation. Now, that says that something is going on at this point. Now, why would that be the tax cut made jobs? Well, simply because you let the businessman keep more of what he owns. So, in terms of job creation, these taxes had a very beneficial effect.What happens if we reverse this? What happens if we go from here? Now, right here, we have a lot of unemployment. What happens in a time of unemployment if we reverse this effect? What we're going to do is it's going to be the same process but backwards. We're going to take jobs that existed and destroy them. Are we in a position with 10 percent or more unemployment to turn around and destroy more jobs? That seems like a definition of an insanity.And these are month by month, year by year. This is what happens after this tax cut and this is the job effect, and I will allow you to comment on it if you want. I've also got two other kinds of interesting charts here, not just jobs but gross domestic product, and your last point, which was government revenues, quite interestingly.

2972,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I come to the floor today to recognize an organization that serves on the frontline of our Nation's most important international and humanitarian efforts--the U.S. Peace Corps. This week, the Peace Corps celebrates its 48th anniversary, and this is National Peace Corps Week.Since the early 1960s, more than 195,000 Peace Corps volunteers have fostered positive relationships between the United States and nations across the globe through its grassroots efforts.At present, 7,500 or more Peace Corps volunteers are active in over 75 countries around the world. These volunteers are exposed to a diverse array of cultures and languages during their time abroad. Approximately 22 percent of the Peace Corps volunteers are currently working in 16 predominantly Muslim countries. It is in these countries, in particular, where I believe the efforts of the volunteers are positively shaping and improving the much beleaguered and much misunderstood image of America within the Muslim world.But there is still much work to be done. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting an expansion of the Peace Corps and all of our Nation's smart power assets.Smart power initiatives build upon our successful defense efforts and add economic and educational efforts, diplomatic efforts, including educational exchanges, free trade, public diplomacy, fostering private sector investments, agricultural development, humanitarian assistance, and English language teaching, just to name a few.All of these smart power initiatives contribute not only to a better life for so many in need, but they also help create conditions for a more stable and peaceful world.America and the developing world will benefit together from a greater investment in these initiatives and in particular in a revitalized and enlarged Peace Corps.Over the past few years, the Peace Corps has received numerous inquiries about entering or reentering the countries where volunteers once served. I made similar inquiries, particularly with respect to friendly Muslim countries in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia. Engaging moderate mainstream countries such as Indonesia with our Nation's smart power initiatives will enhance the conditions for lasting peace and stability.Or as I like to say, putting more sandals and sneakers on the ground will prevent us from having to put more boots and bayonets on the ground in the future.The work undertaken by Peace Corps volunteers serves as a fine example of the United States reaching out to foreign neighbors to foster a greater understanding and dialog. The willingness of Peace Corps volunteers to engage people at the local, community level is exactly how we ought to be providing effective and sustainable development assistance.We need to get back out among the very people we are trying to help, which is why I also believe we need more USAID Foreign Service officers as well. Providing practical, hands-on assistance that is based on listening to the needs of the local population is a recipe for sustainable and lasting development. I believe that by having these kinds of contacts, we can do a great deal to improve the conditions of the countries themselves as well as the people in them. The stronger, more stable these countries are, the better our relations are in the world and the more we foster world peace.We offer our hardy congratulations to all members, current and past, associated with the Peace Corps on its 48th anniversary. We thank you for improving the lives of so many and for helping America be a good neighbor to those in need. Your country is grateful for your service. Your country is grateful for the good will and the seeds of peace you have sown or are sowing. Your country is grateful for your contributions to the safety and long-term security of our Nation. Your efforts and the efforts of other volunteers are needed now more than ever. I will continue to work in supporting your important missions and expanding your ranks.I can't stress enough the importance of our Smart Power initiatives and the importance of investing in efforts such as the Peace Corps. I am very glad to see the Obama administration, particularly Secretary of State Clinton, our former colleague, giving these initiatives an important public boost. And more important, I would say to young people and old--the young people who work with us here and any who may be listening in--that this is a wonderful opportunity to make a significant contribution to other countries, to the cause of peace in the world, and to provide yourself with an education you cannot get in any institution.I look forward to partnering with the new administration and will work with those and others in Congress to lead the effort to make Smart Power initiatives a cornerstone in our foreign policy and in our efforts to combat extremism and terrorism around the world.,2015-03-17 19:12:00.137590,2015-03-17 19:12:00.137590,Senate,NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK,2009-02-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-02-26/html/CREC-2009-02-26-pt1-PgS2545-2.htm,34,0,155,S2545,B000611,mr. bond
2973,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, when Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States, there were a number of statements that were subliminally made to the Nation and, indeed, to the world. And one of the statements was that we, as a Nation, had moved significantly from the days of not only chattel slavery but even the days of Jim Crow and the bitter segregation that enveloped the entire United States.I can remember growing up in Texas, in Wichita Falls, Texas, and my father purchased a home in what was then, very clearly, what was known as a white neighborhood. And when my father purchased the home across the street from, I think, a shopping center that was going to be built, a strip shopping center, he had to move the home from its location to the east side of the tracks, where the African American community lived.He purchased the home, hired a moving company that moved homes, and the home in which my father lives in today, the home in which I and my three sisters grew up in now stands at 818 Gerald Street in Wichita Falls, Texas, and it has been moved, probably, 8 miles from where it was built, because in those days African Americans could not live on the other side of the tracks.Now while I speak very clearly and experientially about Wichita Falls, Texas, please understand that was the case all over the length and breadth of the United States. We had problems where the banks would not lend money to purchase homes in certain neighborhoods. It was called ``red-lining,'' where if a white homebuyer wanted a home, it was clear that the banks would not sell them a home or would not finance the home in certain areas, and they would only finance homes in certain areas for African Americans and to some degree to Hispanics. And this went on in our country for years and years and then decades and decades.And then, finally, as our Nation began to experience what I like to call the ``Great Awakening,'' we found that Martin Luther King, Jr. and Whitney Young really began to change things. And things began to change, really, in the 1950s with Brown v. Topeka Board of Education. And then with the movement, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Martin Luther King, Jr., when you look at what was going on with the NAACP, the Urban League, and I think a beginning of an awakening by all of the country, things began to change, albeit very slowly. And we had the Voting Rights Act approved. We had the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 1965.And then by the 1970s, there was, for the first time, a very clear movement of the United States Congress toward creating some kind of a society that would allow all Americans to enjoy the benefits of America. And so, in 1977, the Congress of the United States put in place something called the Community Reinvestment Act. It is called CRA. And in this act, there was an attempt by Congress to address discrimination in loans made to individuals and businesses from low to moderate income neighborhoods.Now, this is important because finally in 1977--and I know probably for young people who may be watching this broadcast on C-SPAN, they probably are having difficulty even grasping the fact that in 1977 the Congress of the United States had to pass a law that would stop the redlining that pretty much pushed African Americans and Hispanics in certain neighborhoods. They don't see that as much today, although we are still, unfortunately, still bitterly segregated in terms of housing. But in 1975, to reduce discrimination, Congress moved to pass the Community Reinvestment Act. That was a major piece of legislation.And while many Americans probably don't even know what CRA is, this is an opportunity for you to understand what began to change the whole housing drama in the United States of America, the Community Reinvestment Act.This act began to cancel out, to erase, the practice known as ``red-lining.'' And in this Community Reinvestment Act, it required that appropriate Federal financial supervisory agencies would regulate financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local community in which they were chartered, consistent with, I might add, safe and sound operations. And that is important, and I will get to that in just a moment.The agencies that have been commissioned with the responsibility for regulating these agencies, I think most people would know who they are. They would be the FDIC, they would be the Federal Reserve, they would be the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the OCC, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the OTS. And those agencies would have the responsibility to monitor what banks in the United States did to make sure that they did not arbitrarily and capriciously exclude entire segments of cities for loans both in terms of residential homes and in terms of businesses. And therein, Mr. Speaker, we began a new chapter in the United States.At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield time to my friend and colleague from Houston, Congressman Al Green.,2015-03-17 19:12:00.371759,2015-03-17 19:12:00.371759,House,PREDATORY MORTGAGES AND FORECLOSURES,2009-05-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-05-06/html/CREC-2009-05-06-pt1-PgH5286.htm,69,1,155,H5286-H5293,C001061,mr. cleaver
2974,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I come to the floor to celebrate the life of a great American, Jack Kemp.Jack Kemp was many things to many different people. Probably everyone knows the basics about Jack. He was a football player, a Member of Congress, a Cabinet Secretary, and a Vice Presidential nominee. Perhaps he was best known as the coauthor of the Kemp-Roth tax cuts that were the basis of the Reagan economic plan that brought progress out of prosperity and stagflation.Today's Wall Street Journal said about Kemp:He was among the most important Congressmen in U.S. history. He wasn't powerful because he held a mighty post, and he never served in the House majority. He helped to transform the Republican Party though he was never its Presidential standard-bearer. His influence sprang from the power of his ideas, and from the sincerity and enthusiasm with which he spread them.To millions of Americans, he was much more than a football player, Congressman, and candidate. For minorities who suffered from discrimination, Jack was an olive branch from a party that too often ignored them. As a quarterback and as leader of the football players union, he championed the cause of African-American ball players and fought against segregation. For the poor struggling to rise above their circumstances in the inner city, Jack was hope for a better future. He proposed empowering tenets in public housing, offering vouchers for housing and education. For hard-working families who wanted more freedom from Government, Jack was a crusader for their cause. He believed everyone, especially those in inner cities, should have an opportunity to participate in our economy. His idea of enterprise zones has expanded and developed into many different areas of providing opportunities for those caught in circumstances in which they would otherwise have none.Jack was all these things and more. Today Jack serves as a role model, I believe, for the future of our party. Known as the happy warrior, Jack always focused on the positive.Don't get me wrong, Jack never shied away from a fight, and I know that in a couple instances. He called out his fellow party members for protectionism and anti-immigration efforts, believing they were wrong for this country and for the opportunities we seek. No matter how big the adversary, whether it was a linebacker or a powerful committee chair, Jack was a fearless fighter. But as a happy warrior, Jack understood the power of the positive.Today's Washington Post carried an article by Michael Gershon in which he said:Opportunity, [Kemp] argued, is the most important measure of economic justice; capitalism is perfected by the broadest possible distribution of capital; and economic freedom and political freedom are inseparable.Jack was well known for saying:The best way to oppose a bad idea is to replace it with a good one.You see, Jack was more about solutions than party labels. It is that pragmatism and willingness to work across the aisle to solve problems that all of us would be well advised to embrace today. As a self-described bleeding heart conservative, there are so many examples of Jack Kemp doing that. Jack worked across the aisle on some of the most important issues of our time, from civil rights to safe housing for all families. It was Jack who, along with the esteemed Dr. Benjamin Hooks, brought to the national stage the scourge of lead paint poisoning which was afflicting children and families in many of our cities, particularly older ones. Exposure to lead, particularly by young children, was causing learning disabilities, behavioral problems, slowing growth, and possibly causing seizures, coma and, in some serious instances, death.Jack Kemp and Dr. Hooks gave this avoidable tragedy a face and a very powerful voice. Thanks to their advocacy, Senator Mikulski and I launched a $50 million initiative to remove exposed paint in targeted neighborhoods. What started as an idea and a mission is now a more than $300 million program that has helped countless children and their families. But this is just one example of the ideas that Jack, with his tireless advocacy, turned into action to improve the lives of the most vulnerable and needy in our country. Jack's extraordinary life has made a lasting impact on the generations of conservatives he inspired, on the Republican Party, on the national debate, but, most importantly, on the countless lives and communities which have benefited from his powerful ideas being put into action.To Joanne and the rest of the Kemp family, Linda and my thoughts and prayers are with you. We shall always remember and treasure the memory of Jack Kemp and the great contributions he made.I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a copy of the Wall Street Journal piece entitled ``Capitalist for the Common Man'' and the Washington Post column by Michael Gershon entitled ``Head and Heart.'',2015-03-17 19:12:00.593916,2015-03-17 19:12:00.593916,Senate,IN MEMORY OF JACK KEMP,2009-05-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-05-04/html/CREC-2009-05-04-pt1-PgS5046-3.htm,67,0,155,S5046-S5048,B000611,mr. bond
2975,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I wish to speak on the introduction of S. 1547--the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and to join my good friend, Senator Jack Reed, along with Senators Tim Johnson and Patty Murray, on addressing the tragedy of homelessness among our Nation's veterans. My three colleagues have been steadfast in their resolve to address the needs of veterans, including the tragedy of homelessness, and I commend them.Senator Reed has been a strong and committed leader on affordable housing and homeless issues and his leadership played a strong role in the recent enactment of the historic Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act or HEARTH Act. I am honored to join him again.Like the HEARTH Act, the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act builds on our work over the past several years by focusing on the importance of permanent supportive housing. Further, it takes important steps to break down the barriers between the Departments of Veterans Affairs, VA, and Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to ensure that veterans receive the quality services and housing they deserve and need.The most notable element of the legislation is the authorization of HUD-VA Supportive Housing or HUD-VASH rental-assistance vouchers. Working with Senator Patty Murray, new HUD-VASH vouchers have been funded over the past 2 years. While other HUD homeless-assistance programs serve veterans, HUD-VASH is the only permanent housing program that is specifically targeted to veterans and tied to veteran-specific supportive services from the VA.We have been fortunate to fund 10,000 new vouchers each year but with over 130,000 homeless veterans on any given night and thousands more who are at risk of becoming homeless, we must do more and this bill does exactly that.As I noted, there are over 130,000 homeless veterans in America. Sadly, veterans make up a significant and disproportionate amount--over 20 percent--of the country's homeless population. Many of these veterans are from the Vietnam war. Even more sad and stunning is the fact that the number of homeless Vietnam-era veterans is greater than the number of service persons who died during that war.But the face of homeless veterans is changing and is not limited to those who fought in Vietnam. We also are seeing homelessness increase among Desert Storm veterans and veterans returning from the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.In addition, recent reports are finding a troubling trend of homelessness among female veterans. The VA estimates that the number of homeless veterans who are female has doubled over the past decade. And many homeless female veterans carry the burden of being single parents.This bill that I cosponsor sends a loud and clear message that homelessness among our veterans is unacceptable and intolerable.As I have stated in previous speeches, homelessness is thankfully no longer a hopeless situation. We have learned that permanent housing tied to supportive services, such as mental health care and job training, was the antidote to homelessness. Nevertheless, we must continually adjust our programs to meet the changing composition of homelessness.Before closing, I comment on a couple of other items that will help to prevent and end homelessness among our Nation's veterans.First, we must improve the coordination between the Department of Defense, DOD, and the VA. Specifically, DOD, and VA can prevent homelessness among veterans by improving discharge planning and coordination of the medical programs between the two Departments.Second, we must find ways to improve the integration of HUD-VASH programs with services that deliver job training, employment, education, and health care. Specifically, we need to integrate fully the Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program and programs run by the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness was reactivated to address the coordination between Federal agencies. It is my hope that the ICH will work within existing authorities to address the DOD and other service integration issues that I have raised, and come forward with specific recommendations for the Congress to consider. I also look forward to working with Senator Reed and others to address these issues as we move this bill through the legislative process.Again, I thank Senator Jack Reed for his leadership and commitment on issues related to housing, veterans, and national security. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.,2015-03-17 19:12:00.760033,2015-03-17 19:12:00.760033,Senate,ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VETERANS HOMELESSNESS ACT,2009-07-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-07-31/html/CREC-2009-07-31-pt1-PgS8628-2.htm,118,0,155,S8628-S8629,B000611,mr. bond

2977,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank the leaders of this effort, my good friends, Senators Dodd and Shelby, for their hard work and their efforts to address the housing crisis and the need to reform regulatory oversight of the government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mack, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, and reforming FHA.These are clearly needed. They are long overdue. I am happy to support them.In addition, there is clearly a role and a need for the Government to address the current housing crisis. I have supported and led various efforts in the SAFE Act--Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act--that I introduced in March. That had additional housing counseling, improved disclosure and transparency in the home-buying process, and strong enforcement actions against predatory lending. These were essentially included in the bipartisan measure this Senate passed early in April. But I have grave concerns about some aspects of H.R. 3221, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. I filed three amendments to that bill today that I hope we will be able to discuss thoroughly and act upon.It is a fundamental principle that the Congress does not create programs that perpetuate or reward the behavior that led to the housing crisis or damage the key agencies that play a key role in stabilizing the housing market. Unfortunately, this legislation before us today goes against that principle.Specifically, I am gravely concerned about the proposed expansion of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's--HUD--Federal Housing Administration--FHA--contained in this bill. The proposed creation of a new FHA program called the HOPE for Homeowners loan program would allow certain at-risk borrowers to refinance their mortgages and authorize FHA to guarantee up to $300 billion in new loans. The program would allow lenders and borrowers to refinance voluntarily their mortgage loans into a new FHA-insured loan at a significantly reduced loan level with lenders agreeing to write off these reductions as losses.According to the Congressional Budget Office's review of the HOPE for Homeowners loan program, about 400,000 loans would voluntarily participate in this program, which would require about $68 billion in loan commitment authority. CBO projects that about 2.2 million borrowers of subprime and alt-A loans will face foreclosure proceedings during the next three years. Based on a comparison of these numbers, the expected reach of this program will be significantly limited in assisting of homeowners who are expected to face foreclosure. While I would like to keep as many homeowners in their homes as possible, this strategy is more likely to result in a huge bailout for lenders while protecting a very limited number of homeowners. In particular, CBO estimates that under this program, ``mortgage holders would have an incentive to direct their highest-risk loans to the program.'' For a modest write-off, lenders who were, in a number of cases, either fraudulent or negligent in their treatment of borrowers, will be able to clear out many of their problem loans. At the same time, CBO estimates that the cumulative default rate for the HOPE program would be 35 percent--meaning that one out of every three loans refinanced would fail. Frankly, creating a new Federal program that takes on the worst of the worst subprime loans, which will hurt FHA is extremely troubling.The Senate bill pays for to the new FHA HOPE program from GSE assessments. This offset potentially avoids the need for funds from the Treasury to cover the losses as required under the Federal Credit Reform Act. However, whether the costs for the HOPE program would be paid by proceeds from the GSEs or from direct appropriations, it does not change the nature of this program--it is a bailout.As a former member of the Senate Banking Committee and current longtime member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over FHA, I have held a strong and long-time interest on housing and finance issues. A major lesson learned from my work on both the authorizing and appropriating committees is that FHA is significantly limited in managing and implementing its loan activities due to longstanding management and resource challenges. Let me emphasize that point. FHA is significantly limited in managing and implementing its loan activities due to long standing management and resource challenges. They do not have the people and the people are not adequate to the task in too many cases. FHA's challenges have been well-documented by the HUD Inspector General and Government Accountability Office for several years, which has been heard through numerous congressional hearings. All my colleagues who wish access to that information can have it.It also is troubling to me that we are burdening FHA at a time when they are playing a growing role in assisting distressed homeowners. I have heard that FHA's market share has grown tremendously from about 2 percent to as high as 8 percent. To add 400,000 of the worst of the worst new loans to FHA's portfolio at this time is potentially creating a perfect storm for failure. Any collapse in FHA will be borne by the American taxpayer and future appropriations bills, potentially at the expense of other housing programs.It is my belief that the FHA HOPE proposal takes the Government and the taxpayers down a dangerous and risky path, which may worsen the housing problem for borrowers it aims to address. Further, when taking into account the longstanding management and financial challenges of FHA, the expectations being created by the new FHA HOPE program are unrealistic.For those reasons I offer an amendment, No. 4985, to strike title IV of division A, which establishes the HOPE program. I recognize this program is a part of a delicate compromise, but it is too troubling and risky for the American taxpayer. Therefore, I call up amendment No. ,2015-03-17 19:12:01.358481,2015-03-17 19:12:01.358481,Senate,AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008,2008-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-06-19/html/CREC-2008-06-19-pt1-PgS5775.htm,102,33,154,S5775-S5819,B000611,mr. bond
2978,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, to begin, I think I should make some general comments about my concern and about my ability to work with the distinguished chairman of the committee on affordable housing programs. We have worked a long time on these programs together, and he and I, together, pushed for $180 million for counseling for families facing foreclosure. We have gotten that passed. I have been out and talked with the people who are victims, the people who are helping them, the local officials, and that is working.Based on what I learned from talking to the people who are suffering from this foreclosure epidemic and from the real problems in the subprime market caused by predatory lending, which the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, and I tried to get HUD to stop a few years ago, we came up with a solution. That solution I offered on the floor: the Security Against Foreclosure and Education Act, the SAFE Act, most of which was incorporated in the housing bill we passed in April. I believe those things went at this problem in the right way. We understand there is a problem.What I am saying is I fear that taxing GSEs or taking money, expropriating money from GSEs and setting up this HOPE Now Program is a false hope because FHA can't manage it, and they are likely to have a tremendous impact, No. 1, potentially on the housing budget coming out of the taxpayers' pockets. We don't have enough money to pay for all the things we need to do for public and assisted housing.The SAFE Act said reform FHASecure so it could work for somebody who had missed a payment or two, lower the GSE's capital requirement so they could lower this capital housing program; also, provide $10 billion of authorization for State housing finance agencies to raise additional funds to refinance these mortgages which are in default. That, I believe, is the best way to do it. That is why I am very much concerned that we are going down the wrong road, trying to put a burden on the FHA to do something they are not up to. I am afraid the HOPE Program is a false hope for 130,000 families who will enter the program and then default and face foreclosure.The hope is the FHA will somehow be able to dispose properly of those 130,000 homes while they are trying to manage their portfolio. Experience shows that will not work. No matter what kind of board you set up, FHA cannot take on all those additional responsibilities. This program is far more likely to result in a huge bailout for lenders, while protecting a very limited number of homeowners.The Congressional Budget Office--hear this: the Congressional Budget Office estimates that under this program, mortgage holders would have an incentive to direct their highest risk loans to the program. They estimate the cumulative default rate of the HOPE Program would be 35 percent--one out of three--worst of the worst loans and FHA would get them. Where would they get them? From companies that have been a part of the problem.According to the Wall Street Journal, Countrywide issued $167 billion--Countrywide Financial, $167 billion. They had 11 percent of the subprime market and now, according to the Wall Street Journal, they have $30 billion of it, either in their own foreclosures or for those they have offered a guarantee. So there is $30 billion of bad loans on which Countrywide is at risk, and this program could be used to refinance all those programs.If a lender or a holder was facing foreclosure and knew he had to go to foreclosure, it calculates the cost of foreclosure and takes some of that off the value of the home and refinances that value and hands it off to FHA, and FHA gets stuck--gets stuck with it. The FHA has shown they cannot manage and implement the existing loan activities. You can read the lengthy IG reports, the GAO reports. Anybody who has looked at the FHA said they can't handle the job now. They have expanded from 2 percent to 6 percent of the market, and they can't even handle that additional level now.The head of the FHA said this could be a tremendous burden on his agency and potentially on the taxpayers. If FHA is ultimately held at risk for these, they could be in a position where money that would otherwise go to support Section 8 vouchers or public housing operating or capital subsidies would have to be diverted to FHA to pay back the worst of the worst loans--according to CBO--the worst of the worst loans that would be pawned off on the FHA.Nobody cares more than I about dealing with and providing as much help as possible to those people who are unfortunately facing foreclosure, perhaps because of lack of information or even misinformation that was given them about the loans into which they entered and the change in the market which caught them unaware, such as the situation I discussed earlier today of Mr. Willie Clay, the Vietnam veteran who found his mortgage rate readjusting 50 percent higher, which would throw him out of the house. He had an 8.2 percent rate and it was going to go up to over 12 percent. He needs help. These people need help. But bailing--let us bail out the people who are in trouble through the housing--State housing finance agencies or FHASecure; don't have FHA set up to take the fall with the worst of the worst loans from lenders, some of whom may have been ones who put us in the problem.I urge the support of my two amendments and I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:12:01.593627,2015-03-17 19:12:01.593627,Senate,AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008,2008-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-06-19/html/CREC-2008-06-19-pt1-PgS5775.htm,102,209,154,S5775-S5819,B000611,mr. bond
2979,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that goes to the heart of one of the major problems in our loan operations. We have had a system develop where no longer are loans just made available by the State-regulated banks and thrifts. Too many loan offers come over the Internet or by fax. I have not been able to develop a good enough screening program on my computer to keep them out. I know what kinds of solicitations are being made. They are being made by unregulated entities, people not subject to any regulation. As we say back home: We regulate the bricks but not the clicks. We regulate the banks and the savings and loans but not the people who offer you loans too good to be true by fax or Internet.Congress has already taken some steps to address the mortgage origination problem by developing a mortgage licensing and registry system through the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 and protecting consumers by requiring greater mortgage loan disclosure requirements. In addition, I have worked with Senator Dodd, last year and this year, to include more housing counseling funding to assist homeowners. I strongly believe the Mortgage Origination Commission, proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury, is an important element to complement these efforts.As many of us know, the root cause of the current financial crisis is traced to the breakdowns in the mortgage market, led by the high level of failures in subprime mortgages. These failures occurred due to many reasons, but one major reason was the loophole in the Government's oversight and regulatory system for mortgage origination. Specifically, many mortgage brokers with no or uneven regulatory oversight originated a substantial number of all housing mortgages and over half of all subprime mortgages.To help close regulatory loopholes in mortgage origination, my bill contains the key components recommended by the Treasury.First, this legislation creates a new Federal oversight entity called the Mortgage Origination Commission. The Commission would be led by a Presidentially appointed Director for a 5-year term who would chair a seven-member board comprised of the Federal Government's key financial regulators: the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.Second, the Commission would be empowered to develop uniform minimum licensing qualification standards for State mortgage market participants. As laid out in the bill, these standards would include personal conduct and disciplinary history, minimum educational requirements, testing criteria and procedures, and appropriate license revocation standards. The Commission would also evaluate, rate, and report on the adequacy of each State's system for licensing and regulation.The bill retains State-level regulation of the mortgage origination process, but the new Federal Mortgage Origination Commission would ensure that the States have adequate protections in place and improve transparency in the mortgage origination process by providing information on the strength of each State's standards. The Commission will also provide transparency in the securities market by providing evaluations and ratings on mortgages.Finally, the bill clarifies the Federal Government's enforcement and examination responsibilities over mortgage origination companies. Specifically, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision would have clear authority over mortgage originators that are affiliates of depository institutions with a federally regulated holding company. States would have clear authority to enforce Federal mortgage laws governing mortgage transactions involving mortgage originators.In formulating this legislation, my goal was to develop a proposal to provide more effective regulation, transparency, and oversight in a streamlined manner. This bill enhances the current structure without creating a major new Federal entity. If enacted, the Commission could be up and running in a relatively short time.As I said, the legislation mirrors the Secretary of Treasury's proposal, and it is intended to be part of the overall response. I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve this. I know time is running short. I hope they will carefully consider this proposal and perhaps include it in the bill coming to us or in separate legislation. By Mr. BINGAMAN:S. 3584.

2980,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an Ozarks institution--KWTO Radio. AM 560 KWTO will celebrate its 75th anniversary of continuous service to Southwest Missouri providing music, news and information. On Christmas Day 1933, broadcast pioneer Ralph Foster brought KWTO to life with its first broadcast from the old Chamber of Commerce Building on St. Louis Street in Springfield.Foster decided that KWTO's hallmark would be to provide the highest quality news, weather, farm reports and entertainment to its listeners and dubbed the station's call letters ``Keep Watching the Ozarks.'' Adherence to that tradition has kept KWTO the region's longest continuously operating radio station.75 years is a long time to keep any business going. By hiring great talent in broadcasting and entertainment, Foster amassed an amazing group of artists and journalists that would become well known and trusted names in radio. Floyd Sullivan, Bill Bailey and C.C. Williford, who was widely known as one of the nation's best weathermen, filled the region's airwaves from the 1930s.Another group of broadcasters were also laying the foundation for what would become ``the Golden Age'' of entertainment on KWTO AM. Slim Wilson, George Earl and Bill Ring were the showmen that Foster and associate Si Simon used to launch and develop programming that would take a weekly ``hillbilly variety'' program and turned it into one of televisions early sensations.KWTO's Korn's-A-Krackin', which began airing during World War II and continued into the 1960s, was picked up nationally by the Mutual Broadcast System. In July 1954, KWTO became part of American broadcast history when the KWTO Barn Dance program was revamped for the brand new medium and named The Ozarks Jubilee. This live program broadcast from Springfield was an early TV hit (1955 to 1960 on ABC).KWTO, which also produced the Ozarks Country Jubilee, and its television cousin used local artists like Wilson, Red Foley, Mother Maybelle Carter and the Carter Family, Johnny Cash, Porter Waggoner, Les Paul, Brenda Lee and a guitar player named Chet Atkins. These were staff musicians hired to perform live on KWTO from the 1930s through 1950s well before they established iconic careers in country music that led many to Country Music Hall of Fame and/or the Grand Ole Opry decades later.Other notables broadcasting for KWTO at the start of their careers:Charles McCord, from the nationally syndicated Don Imus Show, and whose grandmother, May Kennedy McCord, was also a KWTO broadcaster during the 40s and 50s.Jim Bohannon, now nationally syndicated and a member of the Radio Broadcaster Hall of Fame, was a news reporter at KWTO.Les Garvin, creator of MTV.While not originating his program from KWTO, Ralph Foster's close friend Paul Harvey frequently broadcasted live from the KWTO studio.More contemporary alums from KWTO now hold important positions in business, education and broadcasting including Greene County Clerk Richard Struckhoff, President of the St. Johns Foundation Mike Peters, and Vice President of University Advancement at Missouri State University Brent Dunn, just to name a few.KWTO has long provided vital information to its family of listeners on local and world events. It's where Ozarkers learned on a cold December morning about the attack on Pearl Harbor and heard President Roosevelt's response a day later. KWTO was also the source for news of the surrender of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces. Its broadcasters reported the shocking news of President Roosevelt's death as well as the elation of President Harry Truman's surprise win in 1948. KWTO was home to the Lone Ranger and many other radio favorites for generations.KWTO's commitment to community involvement has also been an integral part of its mission to enhance the quality of life for its listeners. There was ``free ride day'' that started as a charity event cosponsored with the Salvation Army at the Ozark Empire Fair and the hugely successful KWTO Christmas Parties held at the Shrine Mosque that drew crowds so large some people had to be turned away.Local news has always been a critical part of KWTO's commitment to the region. Reporting on a wide range of social, political, law enforcement, and events that marked and shaped the area was a mainstay of everyday programming. In more recent years, the KWTO microphones have been opened to the public for talk show programming that gives voice to a range of opinions.This Christmas Day AM 560 KWTO Radio will celebrate its 75th year of operations and its continuing dedication to serving the Ozarks. I wish KWTO and its current owner Kenneth Myer continued success and many more years of ``Keep Watching the Ozarks.'',2015-03-17 19:12:02.132009,2015-03-17 19:12:02.132009,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF AM 560 KWTO RADIO'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF SERVING SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,2008-12-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-12-10/html/CREC-2008-12-10-pt1-PgE2380-2.htm,185,0,154,E2380,B000575,mr. blunt
2981,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designating the new Federal Courthouse in Cape Girardeau, MO. as the Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr. United States Courthouse.When people talk about the American Dream, the ``Spirit of America'' and the people who helped make this country great, all one really has to do is mention the name of the late Rush Hudson Limbaugh Sr.Mr. Limbaugh led an extraordinary life in which he practiced law for almost 80 years until his death at age 104 in 1996. At the time of his death, Mr. Limbaugh was the Nation's oldest practicing lawyer and still came into work about twice a week at the law firm he founded over 50 years before in Cape Girardeau, MO.Known by his peers as a superb trial lawyer with impeccable character and integrity, he was a beloved icon of the Missouri legal community, especially in Southeast Missouri where he lived all his life.Born in 1891, on a small farm in rural Bollinger County, he was the youngest of eight children and attended school in a one room primary school house. It is said that a passion for the law first developed in Rush as a 10-year-old boy when a Daniel Webster Oration that he memorized inspired him to become a lawyer. Fourteen years later, he began a legal career that lasted eight decades. Throughout those 80 years, his interest in the law and his dedication to his clients never wavered.Rush paid his way through college at the University of Missouri at Columbia by working on the university farm and doing odd jobs such as carpentry, firing up furnaces, caring for animals and waiting tables. While in college, his oratory skills won him awards which he later utilized with great success in the courtroom.In 1914, he entered law school, and after two years, he skipped the third year and passed the Missouri Bar examination. In 1916, he was admitted into the Missouri Bar and his long distinguished legal career began in Cape Girardeau.Over his career, Rush argued more than 60 cases in front of the Missouri Supreme Court along with many prominent civil cases. He was a specialist in probate law and helped draft the 1955 Probate Code of Missouri. He also tried cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the U.S. Labor Board and the Internal Revenue Appellate Division.From 1955 through 1956, he was President of the Missouri Bar and later served as President of the State Historical Society of Missouri. In addition to this, Mr. Limbaugh was a leading member of numerous legal and civic organizations including the American Bar Association, the Missouri Bar Foundation, the Missouri Human Rights Commission, the Cape Girardeau Board of Education and the Salvation Army Advisory BoardHowever, Rush's contributions were not just limited to Missouri. In the late 1950's, Rush served as a U.S. State Department special envoy to India where he promoted American jurisprudence and constitutional government among lawyers, judges and university students in that newly formed country. And in the 1960's, he served as Chairman of the American Bar Association's special committee on the Bill of Rights.Rush was truly an inspiration and mentor to many aspiring lawyers, especially the ones in his own family. His two sons, Rush Jr. and Steven, both practiced law with him for many years. His son, Steven N. Limbaugh, currently serves as a Senior Federal Judge in St. Louis. Four of his grandsons followed in his footsteps and pursued legal careers including his grandson Steven Jr. who is now a Missouri Supreme Court Justice.Perhaps the best measure of Rush Hudson Limbaugh' legacy as a lawyer and as a human being comes from the praise and admiration of his peers in the legal community. ``A top notch all-around lawyer; the epitome of what a lawyer ought to be said one colleague. ``A legend in his time,'' said another.However, his grandson Steven may have offered the best possible description of this great citizen: ``He was an extraordinary man, exemplary in every way, yet very humble. He was a lawyer's lawyer, a community servant and a gentle and kind man whose family was the very center of his life.''It is only fitting that the new Federal courthouse in Cape Girardeau, Missouri be named after this great hero of American Jurisprudence.I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:12:02.416210,2015-03-17 19:12:02.416210,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2007-01-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-01-10/html/CREC-2007-01-10-pt1-PgS359-2.htm,5,33,153,S359-S394,B000611,mr. bond
2982,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President. I rise today to speak in honor of the 150th anniversary of Stupp Bros., Inc., from the great State of Missouri. Five generations of the Stupp family in Missouri have devoted themselves to the success and innovation of this homegrown St. Louis business. On this milestone in the history of Stupp Bros., Inc., I commend the company leaders and employees for their contributions to the worldwide business community.In 1856, the city of St. Louis was a tremendous boomtown and the bustling inland port at the seat of the Mississippi River for pioneers heading westward. Thousands of immigrants flocked to the city from Italy, Ireland, and Germany in search of a better life for their families. One German immigrant named Johann Stupp settled in St. Louis. There he founded J. Stupp and Bro., Blacksmiths, a shop focused primarily on repairing tools and machinery parts.Like many Missourians at the time, Stupp became deeply involved in the Union effort as the Civil War unfolded. During the conflict, Stupp assisted the work of James Eads in crafting a fleet of ironclad gunboats for use in battle by the Union Army. Shortly following the war, the blacksmith shop faced hard times. Yet with the aid of his sons George, Peter, and Julius, Stupp rebuilt the business as Stupp Bros. South St. Louis Iron Works, receiving a charter of incorporation from the State of Missouri for building and repairing iron and steel structural work.After Johann Stupp passed away in 1915, the Stupp brothers continued to manage the company with great success. Recognizing the fast changing and ever-modernizing world in which they lived, the Stupp brothers reorganized the company's services to keep up with the needs of a rapidly growing United States. Like their father during the Civil War, the Stupp brothers supported World War I by fabricating parts for Liberty ships. In World War II, the Stupp Bros. received the Army Navy E-Award for its construction of 176 LCTs, which landed allied troops on beaches throughout the world in the defense of freedom.During much of the 20th century and still today, the Stupp Bros. family of companies has provided bridge fabrication, structural steel for commercial buildings, custom-made piping for oil and gas, steel line pipe coatings, and community banking services. Some of their accomplishments have been designing carrying structures for the Department of Defense to protect missiles from attack, building two straddle-carrier transporters to assist the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, for the ``moon shot,'' and completing a 796 mile natural gas pipeline spanning from northwest Texas to Illinois.Despite its impressive contributions to the country during both war and peace time, the mark of Stupp Bros. is nowhere greater than in the city of St. Louis. As the Kiel Center took shape in 1933, Stupp Bros. provided the steel for its construction. Later in 1978, the Stupp Bros. fabricated over 7,000 tons of steel for the First National Bank highrise building in the downtown area. Perhaps of most interest to me, given my particular fondness for the St. Louis Cardinals, is that Stupp Bros. fashioned the floodlighting and electronic scoreboard for Sportsman's Park, the original Busch Stadium.Recognizing its responsibility to the community, Stupp Bridge has also been a civic contributor to the greater community. In 1951, the company launched a charitable trust to be known as Stupp Bros. Bridge and Iron Co. Foundation Trust. Over the last 50 years, the foundation has generously provided millions of dollars in contributions to local and national charities. One of its most notable actions is the establishment of a scholarship program which supports the college education for the son or daughter of a Stupp employee.The story of Stupp Bros., Inc, is one of American determination, innovation, and service. For 150 years, the company has been a staple among the St. Louis business and industry community. Today, under the leadership of Robert P. Stupp, John P. Stupp, Jr., and R. Philip Stupp, Jr., Stupp Bros. continues to leave its mark upon the landscape of our State. On behalf of all Missourians, I extend my best wishes and warmest regards to the Stupp Bros., Inc., family of companies, and especially to their dedicated employees and company leaders for their 150 years in the great State of Missouri. ,2015-03-17 19:12:02.571322,2015-03-17 19:12:02.571322,Senate,THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF STUPP BROS.

2983,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk about all of the things that the Corps has done wrong and the problems in the past. I don't think anybody believes that there is not a need for reform, review, independent review by experts who can comment on and who can provide valuable input to the Corps. The Corps has learned a lot of lessons, and the Inhofe-Bond proposal creates a mechanism for improving technical quality of the projects that move forward, not an incubator for more lawsuits to delay needed projects.The Inhofe-Bond amendment would encourage independent review of technical information and science, not a review of policy decisions, which are appropriately made in the executive branch and by this body. We don't want to outsource our policy decisions to some other group, as the Feingold-McCain amendment would do. We want to continue an open, fair, and public review of recommendations, and not create a public review created by special interests designed to undo projects for reasons other than policy reasons.We support stabilizing, not destabilizing, Federal/ non-Federal interests in reliance on the Corps. We support Presidential oversight of independent review, not handing government functions over to some unelected commission.When you take a look at the past work of the Corps, you see that the Corps now currently provides 3 trillion gallons of water for use by local communities and businesses. The Corps manages a supply of one-quarter of our Nation's hydropower. The Corps operates 463 lake recreation areas. The Corps moves 630 million tons of cargo valued at over $73 billion annually over the inland water system. It manages over 12 million acres of land and water.The levees that have been properly constructed have prevented an estimated $76 billion in flood damage within the past 25 years, with an investment of one-seventh of that value. These are the tremendous values that can be provided if we can pass this bill and if we can make sensible Corps reform, without providing major hindrances and roadblocks.I hope that the 80 Senators who joined with us in saying ``bring this bill to the floor'' will realize that there is such a thing as appropriate review and there is such a thing as unnecessary, late-stage second guessing, which can be extremely expensive and can delay the benefits that could come from the work of the Corps.The McCain-Feingold independent review amendment has a tremendous potential to delay project construction. They wait until the end of the process, and any mistakes found at the end of the process, as envisioned in the Feingold-McCain amendment, would necessitate a repeat of the study to correct the problems--beginning over again. Clearly, this would delay project construction and drive up costs.Under our proposal, since reviews are integrated into the process, any mistakes made or improvements suggested could be corrected and incorporated at the time. As I said earlier today, it is like waiting to test students in the eighth grade to see if they have first-grade reading capabilities. If a child cannot read at the first-grade level when he or she finishes the first grade, give them remediation then, help prepare them for the second grade; don't wait until they get to the eighth grade and say we just wasted 8 years of this child's education because they could not read at the first-grade level. This essentially--testing at the eighth grade level for first-grade compliance--is what the Feingold-McCain amendment would do.Let's be clear about it. We passed a bill 2 years ago that had all sorts of regulatory redtape and delays. This was opposed by the House, which could not agree on a conference with us. That is why we lost this bill. Putting in a batch of redtape and bureaucratic delays is going to make possible negotiations with the House extremely difficult and could lead to no bill being passed again.So the 2002 Water Resources Development Act that we are still trying to pass in 2006 would go into 2007 and 2008. The benefits that come from the authorized projects in this bill will be delayed. I want the 80 Senators who want to see this bill passed--because they have projects that are important--to understand that the review that is necessary is being incorporated in the Inhofe-Bond amendment. It is being incorporated in a sensible timeframe, reviewing with representatives from the National Academy of Science, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the Independent Research Council, as the project goes along.Everybody knows there needs to be review. The Corps has learned a lot of lessons from mistakes. We ought to learn from our mistakes. One of the mistakes we have made is to try to burden the process and make it so cumbersome it can't work.If you don't want to see the Corps providing water supply, protecting against floods and hurricanes, making sure we have the most efficient, economical, environmentally friendly, energy-friendly means of transportation, then support more bureaucracy, more redtape, and more delays.If, on the other hand, you want to see the Corps do the job and get the job done right, then I ask my colleagues to support the Inhofe-Bond amendment and let us get on about the business of protecting people from floods, from hurricanes, and making sure that our waterways continue to be an efficient energy-conserving means of transporting bulk commodities.I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:12:02.871557,2015-03-17 19:12:02.871557,Senate,WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2005,2006-07-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-07-19/html/CREC-2006-07-19-pt1-PgS7813-2.htm,95,72,152,S7813-S7894,B000611,mr. bond
2984,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. President, today I wish to pay my respects and to say goodbye to a man who was bigger than life itself. John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil passed away on Friday, October 6, in Kansas City at the age of 94. Buck was a gifted baseball player, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, a devoted community leader, a role model for young and old and a good friend he was and will always be an American Hero.I count myself as truly fortunate to have known Buck and will always cherish the opportunities I had to visit with him. When I think of Buck, I think of a great and loving man with a heart as big as Kansas City who believed that love and education could heal all wounds. I think of his near mythical baseball career, a career that spanned seven decades, making him a foremost authority of the game and one of its greatest ambassadors. I think of his contributions to his community as a role model and to society as a leader in the civil rights movement. Buck's contributions to the game of baseball and society will be everlasting.I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about Buck's life.Buck O'Neil, the player, was a first baseman and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs from 1937 through 1955. His achievements include hitting .353 and leading his team to the 1942 Negro World Series Title. His career batting average of .288, included four .300-plus seasons winning batting titles in 1940 and 1946, hitting .345 and.353 respectively. Buck played in the 1942, 1943 and 1949 East-West All-Star Classics and barnstormed with the Satchel Paige All-Stars during the 1930s and 1940s.Buck O'Neil, the manager, led the Monarchs from 1948 through 1955. His achievements as a manager include sending more Negro League players to the Major Leagues than any other manager in baseball history, including Ernie Banks, Elston Howard, Connie Johnson, Sweet Lou Johnson, and Satchel Paige. He led the Monarchs to league titles in 1948, 1950, 1951 and 1953 and he managed the West squad in the East-West All-Star game in 1950, 1952, 1954 and 1955--the West won all four contests.In 1956, Buck was hired by the Chicago Cubs as a scout paving the way for him to make history 6 years later when he became the first African American to coach in the Major Leagues. As a scout he discovered such superstars as Lou Brock and Joe Carter. In 1988, after more than 30 years with the Cubs, he returned home to Kansas City to scout for the Kansas City Royals.The work Buck did after his retirement from the game are arguably more significant to the history of baseball than his exploits on the field as a player, scout and manager. Buck's true passion over the past 16 years was to share with the world the contributions that Negro Leagues players made to our National Pastime and more importantly to society through his work as chairman of America's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City.Buck's tireless work led the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY, to hold a special election this spring to induct Negro Leagues and pre-Negro Leagues candidates into the Hall. In July, 17 legendary players, managers and owners were inducted into the Hall. This induction was bittersweet for many of us as its most visible legend, Buck O'Neil, did not receive the necessary votes. Although many of us viewed this as an outrageous oversight, Buck graciously viewed this as one of the greatest days in Negro Leagues history. That was Buck in his truest form. He was always about doing the right thing. No matter what doors had been closed to him; he always picked himself up and did what was right, never what was easiest or most beneficial to himself. What was most important to Buck was his true love for the Negro Leagues, the Negro Leagues players and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum--he poured all of his life and energy into seeing that their stories were told and never forgotten.Buck reminded us that these Leagues and their players are significant on so many levels: they represent a triumph of the human spirit, tremendous sportsmanship, high quality of play, were of vital importance to the African American community, and they led directly to the integration of the Major Leagues, which was the first in a series of major civil rights landmarks that eventually led to the progress we have achieved today. Buck was significant in so many ways and on so many different levels in his own right--he played an important part in shaping the America we live in today.Buck's remarkable life reminds me of a favorite poem, Game Called, by Grantland Rice. I'd like to read it into the Record:There is little question that Buck played the game with all his heart and lived his life to the fullest. Buck, you will be missed but not forgotten. Our Nation is better by virtue of your play on the field and service off the field. The principle by which you lived your life will carry on through all who knew you. The freedom for which you fought endures. May God bless you with a splendid room within His house. He has certainly blessed me with the privilege of having known you. ,2015-03-17 19:12:03.083679,2015-03-17 19:12:03.083679,Senate,JOHN ``BUCK'' O'NEIL EULOGY,2006-12-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-12-07/html/CREC-2006-12-07-pt1-PgS11494-2.htm,134,0,152,S11494-S11495,T000024,mr. talent
2985,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, 2 weeks ago when I talked about relief for the victims of the tsunami in Indonesia and what we are doing there, I said there was much more I wanted to call to the attention of my colleagues and the people of the United States. One area that is extremely important is the enormous effort that is underway in Indonesia's mainstream, moderate Muslim population to promote a moderate, pluralistic, democratic Islam, both in Indonesia and throughout the region.Unlike the Middle East, in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, Islam and Muslim organizations have been at the forefront of the country's struggle for a democratic society.And Muslim groups and leaders in Indonesia have been among the world's pioneers in driving inter-faith dialogues.During my recent visit to Indonesia, I met Yenny Zannuba Wahid, one of the latest leaders in this movement. Yenny is the daughter of His Excellency Abdurraham Wahid; a Muslim cleric, a leader in promoting religious tolerance in Indonesia and one of Indonesia's first democratically elected presidents.Yenny has founded the Wahid Institute, an organization dedicated ``to bringing justice and peace to the world by espousing a moderate and tolerant view of Islam and working for the welfare of all.''As Yenny noted in a recent speech, Islamist parties gained a sizable vote in the 1999 and 2004 Indonesian elections; these developments present the question of what role Islamic forces will play in setting the direction of social and political evolution in today's Indonesia. Will Indonesia, a democracy with Muslim population of over 200 million, remain on the path of a moderate, pluralistic democracy or will a small but increasingly influential minority of fundamentalistic Islamists steadily gain ground with the masses?Through the creation of the Wahid Institute, Yenny has chosen not to allow these currents to flow without resistence. To be precise, the goal of the WI is to expand on the intellectual principles of Gus Dur to development of moderate Islamic thought that will promote democratic reform, religious pluralism, multiculturalism and tolerance amongst Muslims both in Indonesia and around the world. The institute has set out to create a dialogue between the highest spiritual and political leaders in the West and Muslim world.The Wahid Institute has embarked on an impressive agenda of programs, including an effort to facilitate communication between Muslim and non-Muslim scholars on Islam and Muslim society and on the subjects of Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism; through conferences, discussions, publications and its website--wahidinstitute.org.The Wahid Institute has plans to build a Muslim library, to serve scholars, researchers, activists, built on the library and life work of President Wahid. It is also planning to link Muslim NGOs and committed individuals to build a network of individuals and groups dedicated to promoting these ideals.Just an importantly, the Wahid Institute will focus on the education of young people, supporting opportunities for promising young men and women in Indonesia to focus on progressive and tolerant Muslim thinking.But the Wahid Institute is the latest of the groups committed to promoting moderate Islam. The Liberal Islam Network and International Center for Islam and Pluralism have been hard at work at promoting a peaceful and progressive Islam for sometime. I encourage all to become familiar with these groups.In neighboring Malaysia, a country with a majority Muslim population of 18 million Muslims, recently elected Prime Minister, Abdullah Badawi, has emerged as a strong voice in promoting ethnic and religious tolerance and equality for women.His own country struggled through times of violent race riots and has made ethnic and religious tolerance an objective. Malaysia has been an economic success story and U.S. businesses consider it a great place to invest and do business. But the growing strains of fundamentalist Islam have emerged as a challenge. The new Prime Minister has confronted them.As noted in an excellent opinion piece in the Asian Wall Street Journal written by Diana Lady Dougan, ``with senior positions held by women in his government and a strong personal commitment to religious and ethnic tolerance, . . . Prime Minister Abdullah walks the talk. If he can combine his strong and vocal advocacy of Islam Hadhari with continued progress in Malaysia's economic development based on a rule-of-law government and market-based economies, he is well positioned to become an inspiration far beyond the borders of Malaysia''.I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Ambassador Dougan's op-ed be printed in the Record at the end of my speech.,2015-03-17 19:12:03.338867,2015-03-17 19:12:03.338867,Senate,MODERATE ISLAM MOVEMENTS,2005-02-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-02-09/html/CREC-2005-02-09-pt1-PgS1189-2.htm,13,0,151,S1189-S1191,B000611,mr. bond
2986,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the life, leadership and the truly remarkable legacy of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.President Reagan was a great communicator with a powerful message. He preached the gospel of hope, freedom and opportunity not just for America but for the world. Reagan was a genuinely optimistic person who brought that spirit of optimism and hope to the American people and to enslaved peoples around the world. He was a man who took disappointment and moved on. He was a man of unfailing good humor, care and thoughtfulness. Even people who disagreed with his policies across the board could not help but like him.In the U.S., his policies encouraged the return of more tax dollars to average Americans and unfettered entrepreneurship to create jobs and build the economy. Reagan's strong military opposition to the Soviet Union helped bring down the walls that harbored communism and tyranny throughout Eastern Europe and much of the world.In a letter to the American people in 1994 Ronald Reagan announced he was one of the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease. One of the most courageous things Ronald and Nancy Reagan did was to announce publicly that he had Alzheimer's disease. Through their courage and commitment, the former President and his wife, Nancy, changed the face of Alzheimer's disease by increasing public awareness of the disease and of the need for research into its causes and prevention.In honor of Ronald Reagan, today my colleague Senator Mikulski and I are introducing the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act. This bill will increase research for Alzheimer's and increase assistance to Alzheimer patients and their families. This bill will serve as a living tribute to President Reagan and will: 1. Double funding for Alzheimer's Research at the National Institute of Health; 2. increase funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program from $153 million to $250 million; 3. reauthorize the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program that provides grants to states to fill in gaps in Alzheimer's services such as respite care, home health care, and day care; 4. authorize $1 million for the Safe Return Program to assist in the identification and safe, timely return of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias who wander off from their caregivers; 5. establish a public education campaign to educate members of the public about prevention techniques that can ``maintain their brain'' as they age, based on the current research being undertaken by NIH; 6. establish a $3,000 tax credit for caregivers to help with the high health costs of caring for a loved one at home; and 7. encourage families to prepare for their long term needs by providing an above-the-line tax deduction for the purchase of long term care insurance.Ironically it was President Reagan who drew national attention to Alzheimer's for the very first time when he launched a national campaign against Alzheimer's disease some 22 years ago.In 1983 President Reagan proclaimed November as National Alzheimer's Disease Month. In his proclamation President Reagan said ``the emotional, financial and social consequences of Alzheimer's disease are so devastating that it deserves special attention. Science and clinical medicine are striving to improve our understanding of what causes Alzheimer's disease and how to treat it successfully. Right now, research is the only hope for victims and families.''Today, approximately 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's, with annual costs for this disease estimated to exceed $100 billion. Today there are more than 4.5 million people in the United States with Alzheimer's, and that number is expected to grow by 70 percent by 2030 as baby boomers age. In my home State of Missouri, alone, there are over 110,000 people with Alzheimer's disease. Based on population growth, unless science finds a way to prevent or delay the onset of this disease, that number will increase to over 130,000 by 2025--that is an 18 percent increase.In large part due to President Reagan, there has been enormous progress in Alzheimer research--95 percent of what we know we discovered during the past 15 years. There is real potential for major breakthroughs in the next 10 years. Baby boomers could be the first generation to face a future without Alzheimer's disease if we act now to achieve breakthroughs in science.President and Mrs. Reagan have been leading advocates in the fight against Alzheimer's for more than 20 years, and millions of Americans have been helped by their dedication, compassion and effort to support caregivers, raise public awareness about Alzheimer's disease and increase of nation's commitment to Alzheimer's research.This bill will serve as a living tribute to President Reagan and will offer hope to all those suffering from the disease today. As we celebrate the life and legacy of Ronald Reagan, we are inspired by his legendary optimism and hope, and today we move forward to confront this expanding public health crisis with renewed vigor, passion, and compassion.,2015-03-17 19:12:03.617065,2015-03-17 19:12:03.617065,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2005-03-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-03-10/html/CREC-2005-03-10-pt1-PgS2484.htm,28,11,151,S2484-S2496,B000611,mr. bond
2987,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Madam Speaker, I rise and ask my colleagues in the House to support this resolution. In addition to the kind words that already have been mentioned, FarmHouse had a unique, but a humble, beginning in my home town of Columbia, Missouri.Like many social organizations at the University of Missouri campus, there were few students back in 1905 to draw from for its members. Its purpose, its objective back then was really not clearly defined or understood. And so it attracted little attention. It was not the result of any sort of a crisis among ag students, but was rather the result of a need for recognition of a small and subordinate and specialized group in the area of higher education.The University of Missouri College of Agriculture was established back in 1870 as part of the land grant system. A lot of my colleagues here still to this day defend mightily the land grant system. It was a small division of the ag school back in 1905 within the University of Missouri. There were less than 100 students. It was not really held in the same high regard or high esteem as the school of law or the school of medicine, and most of those students were all farm-reared boys.But a rather close relationship developed among this group of 35, a lot of them attended the same class, everyone knew each other, and there developed among them this sense of camaraderie. So as an outgrowth of this fellowship and the friendships that were formed, there were three men, D. Howard Doane, Henry P. Rusk and Earl Rusk, who conceived this idea of forming an agricultural club in order to perpetuate this congenial association.In fact, as history has it, at least as we tell it, they began to have this discussion on a Sunday afternoon at a YMCA Bible meeting. So it was desirable that they were going to make this group, and they proposed to rent a house and live together, and this was in the spring of 1905.And from the diary of Mr. Doane comes the following record: ``At the close of my freshman year, there was organized a club of farmers, principally from the freshman class, to run a clubhouse to be known as the FarmHouse. When school opened in September, only seven of the group returned.''I mentioned Mr. Doane and the two brothers Rusk, and the others that joined them were Robert F. Howard, Claude B. Hutchison, Henry H. Krusekopf, and Melvin E. Sherwin.Back now to Mr. Doane's diary: ``They took the house on their hands and turned it into a regular rooming and boarding house. Those seven fellows were the best bunch that ever got together. During the whole year they managed the house without one single disagreeable incident.''I am tempted to go into a parenthetical aside regarding this body, but I will choose not to do that. And then finally from Mr. Doane's diary: ``Many a night this dear old bunch assembled with gravest doubts assailing them and wondering if it was all worth while.''Well, Mr. Doane, in the humble opinion of this FarmHouse alum, it was indeed worthwhile. Thirty chapters across the country, including Canada, with a list of notable alumni, including just a smattering of those: former Kansas Governor, John Carlin; George Beadle, who received a Noble Prize in medicine and genetics back in 1958; Pulitzer Prize winner Ezra George Thiem; and Hall of Fame athletes Ed Widseth from Minnesota and legendary Missouri Coach Don Faurot; 49 past national FFA officers; one former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture; and entertainers Leroy Van Dyke, Michael Martin Murphey, and Pat Green.More than 24,000 men have become members of FarmHouse Fraternity. And while the others do not necessarily hold a title, each has made his own mark within the community and the family in which they live, putting into action the FarmHouse motto: ``Builder of Men.''I was honored to be invited to speak to an event back in Columbia, Missouri, over 530 participants, back in April of this year. And I would ask that this body, that the House of Representatives today recognize the 100th anniversary of FarmHouse Fraternity and commend the fraternity and its members for a century of service.Miss McMORRIS. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-17 19:12:03.897286,2015-03-17 19:12:03.897286,House,RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF FARMHOUSE FRATERNITY, INC.,2005-06-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-06-21/html/CREC-2005-06-21-pt1-PgH4808-7.htm,83,15,151,H4808-H4810,H000948,mr. hulshof
2988,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the brave survivors of this disease. The statistics for breast cancer are staggering. One out of every eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, and 1 out of every 229 women in their 30s will be affected by the disease at some point in their lives. The unfortunate truth behind these numbers is that there is a limited amount of information available on women under 35 with breast cancer. The general sentiment is that women in their 20s and 30s are too young to contract the illness, but the reality is that women of this age are not immune.Four young women have shared their stories of survival with each other as part of a support group called Nordie's at Noon, and they recently published a book of the same name documenting their stories. These women were in the first stages of their lives when they were diagnosed with breast cancer, and their stories, although different, are bound together by a common challenge. These courageous women are Patti Balwanz, Kim Carlos, Jennifer Johnson, and Jana Peters.Patti Balwanz fought a long and brave battle against breast cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 24, while working as an IT consultant. Her cancer metastasized to her bones, lungs and liver, but she used her experience to educate women about the disease. Patti stayed active in breast cancer awareness outlets during her treatment by serving as a Board Officer of the Ribbons of Pink Foundation and being honored with the foundation's ``You Are an Inspiration'' award. Patti also continued her education by receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree trom Southwest Missouri State University and remaining active in the Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority. Until her death in 2003, Patti continued to educate women about breast cancer while bravely facing her own fight.Kim Carlos was diagnosed with breast cancer during the planning of her son's second birthday party. After three years of extensive treatment including eight rounds of chemotherapy, a mastectomy with breast reconstruction, and treatments for lymphedema, Kim is now cancer-free. Currently Kim serves as President of the Board for the Greater Kansas City Affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, and she was recently selected to serve on the Komen National Public Policy Council. Kim is also a member of the American Cancer Society State Advocacy Committee. She has been honored by Lifetime Television and SELF Magazine for her efforts in educating women about breast cancer. Kim now focuses on advocacy full-time with her business, K.C. Consulting, where her focus is governmental and public relations and grassroots avocacy.While five months pregnant with her first child, Jennifer Johnson was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 27. Her treatment involved chemotherapy and a mastectomy during her pregnancy. Jennifer completed her final chemotherapy treatment in 2000, and the next day delivered a healthy baby boy, Parker Matthew. Three years later, Jennifer had a daughter, Emma Grace, and she has been cancer-free for six years. Jennifer is active in several breast cancer advocacy groups including the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. Komen Association, the Ribbons of Pink Foundation, and the Pregnant with Cancer organization.Jana Peters was 27 and engaged to be married when she received her breast cancer diagnosis. She has undergone several treatments since then including a mastectomy and chemotherapy. In 1999 Jana founded the Ribbons of Pink Foundation, a non-profit organization with the goal of promoting breast health and serving as a support for young breast cancer survivors. She is a member of the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, and she is a volunteer for several breast cancer organizations and events. Jana continues her career in the clinical research industry in San Francisco, where she resides with her husband Chris.We celebrate these courageous women who have battled breast cancer and those who continue their fight against this illness. Breast cancer survivors and supporters gather to raise awareness and encourage the access of information for breast cancer in young women. Thank you to Patti, Kim, Jennifer and Jana for sharing their stories of bravery and determination.,2015-03-17 19:12:04.053376,2015-03-17 19:12:04.053376,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH,2005-10-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-10-27/html/CREC-2005-10-27-pt1-PgE2188.htm,139,0,151,E2188,C001061,mr. cleaver
2989,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ray Beck, the presiding city manager of Columbia, MO, as he is retiring this January after 45 years of service to the city of Columbia. Ray has held numerous positions during his tenure with the city of Columbia, the most notable of which is his current post of city manager, which he has held since 1985.The second youngest of six children, Ray Beck was born in St. Elizabeth, MO, on November 9, 1932. After graduating from St. Elizabeth High School, Ray went on to earn both a bachelor's and a master's degree in engineering from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Ray then dutifully served his country as an officer in the US. Army. He is also a graduate of the US. Army Field Artillery School as well as the US. Army Command and General Staff College.Ray always knew that his life would be best spent working as a public servant. As my colleagues here in this Chamber can attest, public service can be an extremely rewarding experience. This calling is the reason why I ran for Congress and am fortunate enough to represent the good people of the Ninth District of Missouri. I am saddened to see Ray leave this position with the city of Columbia, as he has not only been an invaluable resource to the city and myself, he has also become a good friend. His counsel and words of wisdom have certainly aided me as we worked collaboratively for the benefit of Columbia.Columbia looks a lot different today than in 1960 when Ray first started working for the city. Over this time span, Columbia's population has more than doubled to its current size of roughly 91,000 residents. The cityscape continues to evolve as more and more families and businesses flock to the area. With its strong business climate, close-knit community, excellent public schools and ready access to world-class higher education, Columbia has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable places to live. Ray can look back with pride at this progress.Through his official capacities as city manager, Ray has helped Columbia develop into the vibrant city it is today. During his tenure, Columbia established a city-operated waste removal program, expanded the local parks and recreation services, and implemented a municipally operated transit system as well as many other public works projects.Whether it was working to improve the city's sewer systems, roadways or public utilities, these infrastructure improvements have made Columbia a better place to live and work. Ray accomplished all of this and much more while working with 14 different mayors.Aside from his official duties, Ray has always been actively involved in the community. Through his involvement with the National Recreation and Parks Association, the University of Missouri-Columbia Dean's Engineering Advisory Council, or the Missouri Highways Engineers Association, Ray was always seeking additional resources or contacts that could assist him in his various endeavors for the city. His drive, however, was not only limited to work related activities. Ray should be commended for his good work and involvement with the MU Alumni Association, the United Way and the U.S. Army Retired Officers' Association, just to name a few.When Ray retires this January, I suspect he may shed a few tears--some of joy and some of sadness. But when he looks back upon his career, I hope he realizes how much his work has improved the lives of those who make Columbia their home. And for that, I am eternally grateful.I know his new priorities will no longer focus either on housing or sewer systems, but spending time with his wife, Dee, his 4 children, his 13 grandchildren and his many friends. I only hope that on the day of my retirement I can look back upon a career as accomplished as his.Ray, I sincerely thank you for your dedication and service to Columbia and the State of Missouri. Congratulations on a well-deserved retirement.,2015-03-17 19:12:04.365597,2015-03-17 19:12:04.365597,Extensions,HONORING THE WORK OF RAY BECK,2005-12-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-12-18/html/CREC-2005-12-18-pt1-PgE2614.htm,164,0,151,E2614,H000948,mr. hulshof
2990,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce a celebration to honor Cesar Chavez on April 24, 2004, in Kansas City, Missouri. This celebration commemorates his legacy and the eleventh anniversary of his death, April 23, 1993.Cesar has become a champion of working people everywhere. Born into Depression-era poverty in Arizona in 1927, he served in the United States Navy in the Second World War, and rose to become one of our greatest advocates of nonviolent change.The farm workers who labored in the fields and yearned for respect and self-sufficiency pinned their hopes on this remarkable man, who, with faith and discipline, with soft-spoken humility and amazing inner strength, led a very courageous life. And in so doing, he brought dignity to the lives of so many others and provided inspiration for the rest of our Nation's history.After achieving only an eighth-grade education, Cesar left school to work in the fields full-time to support his family. It was there that he noticed the labor contractors and the land owners exploited the workers. He tried reasoning with the farm owners about higher pay and better working conditions. But most of his fellow workers would not support him for fear of losing their jobs. Cesar's dream was to create an organization to protect and serve farm workers, whose struggles he shared. At the age of 35, he left his own well paid job to devote all his time to organizing the farm workers into a union. Cesar traveled from camp to camp recruiting workers, and the National Farm Workers Union was born.With a strong leader to represent them, the workers began to demand their rights for fair pay and better working conditions. Without these rights, no one would work in the fields. In 1965, the grape growers didn't listen to the union's demands, and the farmhands wanted a strike. The workers left the fields, and the unharvested grapes began to rot on the vines. Union members, Cesar included, were jailed repeatedly. But public officials, religious leaders, and ordinary citizens from all across the United States flocked to California to march in support of the farm workers. In 1970, some grape growers signed agreements with the union. The union lifted the grape boycott, and its members began to pick grapes again. That same year, Cesar thought that even people who could not travel to California could show their support for his cause. Thus he appealed for a nationwide boycott of lettuce. People from all parts of the United States who sympathized with the cause of the farm workers refused to buy lettuce. Some even picketed in front of supermarkets.By 1973, when Cesar inspired the people of Kansas City with his message of equality, justice and social change in an address at Penn Valley Community College, the union had changed its name to the United Farm Workers of America. Relations with the grape growers had once again deteriorated, so a grape boycott was added to the boycott of lettuce. On several occasions, Cesar fasted to protest the violence that arose. Finally, by 1978, some of the workers' conditions were met, and the United Farm Workers lifted the boycotts on lettuce and grapes. This is just one example of how dedicated Cesar was to the union and the people who counted on him.Up until the day he died, he was concerned as ever about dignity, justice, and fairness. He said, ``Fighting for social justice, it seems to me, is one of the profoundest ways in which man can say yes to man's dignity, and that really means sacrifice. There is no way on this earth in which you can say yes to man's dignity and know that you're going to be spared some sacrifice.''Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring a small man with a big dream, Cesar Chavez. Cesar Chavez is a dedicated and true American hero: A civil rights, Latino and labor leader, a community servant and a crusader for nonviolent social change.,2015-03-17 19:12:04.628778,2015-03-17 19:12:04.628778,Extensions,HONORING CESAR CHAVEZ ON THE ELEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH,2004-04-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-04-02/html/CREC-2004-04-02-pt1-PgE533-3.htm,45,0,150,E533-E534,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2991,MO,James,Talent,R,I thank my friend from Virginia for yielding, and I congratulate him for his great work in getting this bill together. It is very much needed.We cannot operate a modern college or university today without being up to date with information technology. The range of uses and needs for that kind of technology are almost unlimited. They cover everything from long distance learning to access to research for students to the ability to teach your students about information technology. Of course, most jobs include a requirement that you be up to date in that kind of technology.Another important use for universities is helping the communities around them. I will talk about an example of that in just a few minutes. Most modern colleges and universities, whatever their background, are networking very close to the communities which they serve. As centers of excellence in information technology there is a wide variety of ways to make a difference. That is an important contribution that historically black universities and minority institutions make.It is important to understand these institutions are not just important for the students who attend. That is their primary function, but they are very important centers of achievement and community activities in the communities of which they are a part. That is the reason this bill is so important and why I am pleased to cosponsor it and pleased to speak for just a few minutes today on its behalf.Most of the background has been given here and I appreciate very much the work of the chairman and Senator Allen in supporting this bill and assembling this information. They had a great hearing.Let me talk about a couple of historically black colleges in Missouri that would benefit from this bill. One is Lincoln University in Jefferson City. Lincoln was founded in 1866 by former officers and soldiers of the Union Army. It has 2,500 undergraduates, 200 graduate students. David Henson, the president of Lincoln University, told us that the passage of the bill would give Lincoln the opportunity to acquire equipment, networking capability, digital network technology, wireless technology, and infrastructure to develop and provide educational services to its students, its faculties, and its staff, and also give Lincoln students universal access to campus networks around the country.Another historically black college is Harris-Stowe State College with a rich tradition in the St. Louis area. Henry Givens, Jr., the president of Harris-Stowe State College, said this would enable their students and faculty to take advantage of a variety of sources, such as distance learning, online services, and continuing education.I mentioned before that the colleges are very important parts of the communities they serve. Harris-Stowe helps educate young kids from the community. This kind of a grant would benefit the local public elementary school. It sends its children ranging from first to fifth grade to learn at the Southwestern Bell Library and Technology Resource Center at Harris-Stowe College. Harris-Stowe got a grant to build the center, but the technology is now very much out of date. This is another aspect that this bill will help address, and I think it is important.Of course, most historically black colleges and minority-serving institutions have not had a lot of money and do not have access to a lot of money to build these kinds of information technology centers in the first place. But even when they can get the money to do that, it is extremely difficult for them to maintain and upgrade and update that technology. There is no area where it is more important to be up to date than the area of information technology. That is the situation with Harris-Stowe. Their resource center is 5 years old. It is greatly in need of a technology upgrade. Without Federal legislation of this type, as a practical matter that is simply not going to be possible on an ongoing basis.But with this support it will be possible, not only because of the Federal dollars we can help provide but also because the Federal dollars will be leveraged by these institutions with foundations, with State money, and will be an important way for them to gather resources from around the community and help serve their students and their communities with information technology.I am grateful the Senator from Virginia has taken up this legislation and pushed it. A lot of what we do here is an attempt to directly fund or subsidize what some people are doing. It works so much better when we work through institutions that already have strong records of performance and strong records of service to constituencies around the country. That is what this bill does. I am very pleased to support it.,2015-03-17 19:12:04.860949,2015-03-17 19:12:04.860949,Senate,DIGITAL AND WIRELESS NETWORK TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 2003,2003-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-30/html/CREC-2003-04-30-pt1-PgS5504-2.htm,63,23,149,S5504-S5510,T000024,mr. talent
2992,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. President, I am looking forward to voting for the jobs and growth package when it comes out of conference and reaches the Senate floor. One of the lessons of the last few years is that we cannot do anything that any of us want to do without prosperity. We cannot do education the way we would like; we cannot improve the quality of health care the way we want to; we cannot protect our Nation's borders the way we would like to; and we cannot provide for our defense the way we would like to without prosperity.Prosperity means jobs. The way to get jobs, among other things, is to put more money into the hands of people who save, spend, and invest, and that means tax relief. That is what the jobs and growth package is about.It is not the only way, though, to increase jobs and create economic growth in our country. Another way to do that is by opening up markets abroad. One of the ways we do that is by getting our competitors to end tariffs, end the nontariff obstacles they have placed on importing our products.For too long we have let the European Union get away with illegal, unwarranted, and protectionist trade policies regarding agricultural biotechnology. I strongly support the President and the administration in the case before the WTO against the European Union. I want to take a few moments to talk about that situation this evening.For the past 5 years--half a decade--the European Union has effectively blocked our agricultural trade into Europe through their moratorium on the approval of new biotechnology products entering the European market.Since its implementation in October 1998, the moratorium has blocked more than $300 million annually in U.S. corn exports to the European Union countries. When you look at the total cost of the moratorium, our corn producers have lost $1.5 billion in exports to the European Union.This moratorium clearly violates WTO rules requiring measures regulating imports to be based on ``sufficient scientific evidence'' and mandating countries to operate regulatory approval procedures without ``undue delay.'' And as far as sufficient scientific evidence is concerned, they have zero standing. Moreover, their policies are holding back products that hold tremendous promise for improving the food supply, advancing human health and preventing famine in the developing world.The actions of the EU not only violate laws established by the WTO, but also, the EU is violating its own laws requiring science-based regulatory decisionmaking.The EU policy decisions on biotechnology are being driven by people disdainful of science and its capacity for solving problems facing mankind and critical of the leading role of the United States in scientific advancement.It is likely that nearly every American has eaten a meal made with corn and soybeans enhanced through biotechnology. These products have been sold and served in restaurants, local grocery stores and farmers' markets for years, without any adverse health consequences ever being reported.Additionally, agriculture biotechnology, contrary to what the EU may say, is good for the environment. In 2001 alone, biotechnology reduced the application of pesticides by 46 million pounds, in addition to reducing soil erosion and creating an environment more hospitable to wildlife. However, the facts have not stopped the EU from propping up their moratorium on a flimsy foundation. In addition to their anti-American policies, the EU has more recently pursued policies to undermine the development and support of genetically engineered products around the world, including in countries facing famine, and that was the turning point in this case.About 40 million people in Africa's famine-stricken nations are at risk of starvation and diseases brought about by incessant hunger. Additionally, 800 million children are starving worldwide. Ongoing droughts and famines have devastated these countries, leaving them without options, and much too often, without hope.Last fall, three African countries--Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique--were pressured to turn down shipments of safe, nutritious, U.S. humanitarian biotech food aid by the EU. The EU even threatened their export markets if they accepted biotechnology food aid. To do that to a country threatened with famine is nothing less than extortion.This is the same food that we eat here in the United States. It is unconscionable to me that the EU would promote these anti-humanitarian, anti-development policies.The EU should try honesty for once. They should try explaining the real reason they do not like American biotechnology: they want to protect their market from competition. They want to protect European markets by ignoring the scientific evidence, which makes clear the safety and nutritional advantage of biotechnology.Our agriculture producers are leading the biotech revolution and providing us with the most affordable, most abundant and safest food supply in the world. And Missouri's producers are among the leaders in the country.When the U.S. wins this lawsuit, it will be a victory for our producers who have lost more than $300 million annually in corn exports, and also for science, the environment and everyone who wants to win the war against famine and world hunger.I applaud the President for filing this suit in the WTO. In doing so, he is once again demonstrating the kind of leadership and courage we have come to expect from him I appreciate our leadership working so quickly on this important issue.Senator Bond and I, along with several others, have submitted a resolution in support of the action in the WTO against the European Union. I urge my colleagues to consider this resolution expeditiously, to support it, and to give the administration the ammunition they need to prosecute this lawsuit successfully.I yield the floor.,2015-03-17 19:12:05.138145,2015-03-17 19:12:05.138145,Senate,JOBS AND GROWTH PACKAGE,2003-05-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-05-22/html/CREC-2003-05-22-pt2-PgS6958.htm,77,13,149,S6958-S6964,T000024,mr. talent
2993,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to MG Arnold Punaro, United Stated Marine Corps Reserve, on the occasion of his retirement. Major General Punaro has served our Marine Corps and our Nation for more than 35 years.A native of the great state of Georgia, Major General Punaro grew up in the town of Macon, and graduated from Mount de Sales Academy. He then chose to focus on higher education, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in English from Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama. He would later earn Masters degrees at the University of Georgia and also Georgetown University. Like many fine, Southern gentlemen before him, he answered the call to duty and joined the Marine Corps, serving as a platoon commander in Vietnam where he was decorated for heroism and wounded in combat.In 1973, after completing his active duty tour, Major General Punaro transferred to the Marine Corps Reserve, and continued to dedicate himself to the service of our country, working in the U.S. Senate for Senator Sam Nunn on national security matters for 24 years. In his work with the Senate Armed Services Committee as Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he was involved in the formulation of all major defense legislation and the oversight and review of all major defense activities for over two decades. This included the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act and its Reserve counterpart, the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act, the Acquisition Streamlining Act, personnel transition provisions, special operations reforms, and all pay and benefits matters. Major General Punaro also remained actively involved in numerous Reserve organizations, including a tour on active duty in Operation Desert Shield and an extended tour on active duty as the Commander of Joint task Force Provide Promise (Forward) in command of U.S. Forces serving in the former Yugoslavia.Throughout his career, both civilian and military, MG Arnold Punaro dedicated himself to improving our national security. He serves as a member of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's newly formed Defense Business Board and is also a Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. He serves on the adjunct faculty at the Marine Corps University and on the Secretary of Defense Reserve Forces Policy Board. As a general officer, he has spent 5 years in command, focusing on increased operational readiness and the integration of reserve forces into the total force Marine Corps. Always keeping the welfare of his Marines at the forefront of his efforts, Major General Punaro spearheaded several programs that directly benefited the quality of life for our service members.Major General Punaro was recently mobilized on active duty, serving concurrently as a Special Assistant to the Commander, U.S. European Command and as Director of Reserve Affairs Division where he oversaw the largest mobilization in the history of the Marine Corps. In support of the Global War on Terrorism, more than 22,000 Reserve Marines were called to duty. More than 75 percent of those were deployed into theater, where they served with distinction. His dedication to the defense of our country, as a young man in Vietnam to his actions with the Senate together with his continued service with the Marine Corps Reserve, has been a lifelong endeavor. We have been fortunate to have such a high caliber marine officer in support of our nation.Throughout his distinguished career, Major General Punaro has demonstrated uncompromising character, discerning wisdom, and a sincere, profound sense of duty to his country, and his Corps. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I would like to recognize Major General Punaro's accomplishments and his devoted service to the Nation. Congratulations to him, his wife Jan and their four children, 2LT Joe Punaro (USMC), Julie, Meghan, and Daniel on the completion of a long and distinguished career. I wish them all the best as they continue to live life beyond our country's beloved Corps.,2015-03-17 19:12:05.294256,2015-03-17 19:12:05.294256,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO MG ARNOLD PUNARO,2003-10-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-10-07/html/CREC-2003-10-07-pt1-PgE1980-2.htm,140,0,149,E1980,S000465,mr. skelton
2994,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to my parents, William ``Bill'' and Carol Clay, on the occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. As many of you know, my father, former Congressman Bill Clay, represented the 1st Congressional District of Missouri in this body for 32 years.My parents were married on October 10, 1953 in St. Louis, Missouri. Their life together has been built upon a solid foundation of love, mutual respect, honor and dedication. Over the years they have worked very hard to be responsible parents to their three children, while at the same time toiling tirelessly to provide service to the ``larger'' family of constituents in St. Louis and beyond.My father served in elective office for over 40 years and my mother stood by his side every step of the way. From their attempt to desegregate the public swimming pool at Fort McClellan in Alabama, to the marches and protests for employment opportunities at the Jefferson Bank and Trust Company and Howard Johnson's Restaurant in St. Louis, my parents were at the forefront of the struggle for justice and equality from the very early years of their marriage. On one occasion, my father spent 118 days in jail as a result of protesting injustice. During that period, my mother would take us regularly to the jail house to see him, so that we would understand what he was doing and why. My parents instilled a deep sense of commitment to fighting injustice and righting wrongs within my sisters and me at an early age.One of my fondest memories was in January 1969 when my father was sworn in as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Following his lead, as we normally would, my sisters and I raised our right hands in an effort to take the oath of office with him. At that time, we could not have foreseen an even prouder moment for our family when, 32 years later I had the privilege and honor of being sworn in as a Member of this esteemed body. As I was taking the oath of office, I looked over to my father and noticed a tear fall from his eye while my mother stood beside him, misty-eyed as well.Throughout his long and distinguished career, my father has been a trailblazer, a pacesetter, an innovator and a fearless leader. At the same time, my mother has been the advocate, the nurturer, the rock solid supporter and the foundation of the Clay family. I take pleasure in reflecting upon all of the wonderful lessons and guidance they have given my sisters and me over the years. They taught us the importance of family commitment, being patient and respecting the opinions of others. They also taught us to always be prepared and look at life from a practical point of view.Their contributions to our community and our Nation are enormous. In addition, their strong commitment to the education of young people is exemplary. Together they have helped raise over $3 million in college scholarships for minority students through their efforts with the William L. Clay Scholarship and Research Fund. This Fund was founded by my father and the Congressional Black Caucus Spouses organization, of which my mother was a cofounder.My sisters, Vicki Clay Jackson, Michelle Clay Rorie, and I will honor Bill and Carol in celebration of their golden wedding anniversary on Saturday, October 11, 2003. We are being assisted in this momentous undertaking by all five of Bill and Carol Clay's grandchildren--Angela Clay, Michael Alexis, H. Clay Rorie, Carol W. Clay and William L. Clay, III. Family, life-long friends and colleagues from throughout the Nation will be joining us on that marvelous occasion to extend thanks and appreciation for their love, guidance and friendship.Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues extend a well-deserved and heartfelt round of congratulations to Bill and Carol Clay as they celebrate 50 years of love and devotion to one another and to the Clay family.,2015-03-17 19:12:05.560445,2015-03-17 19:12:05.560445,Extensions,HONORING THE 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF BILL AND CAROL CLAY,2003-10-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-10-07/html/CREC-2003-10-07-pt1-PgE1982-2.htm,140,0,149,E1982,C001049,mr. clay
2995,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, discussions about the state of our democracy too often focus on what is wrong with our political system.Experts bemoan low turnout; they say young people are turned off by politics; they say grassroots campaigns no longer can work in the age of 30-second television ads.But Americans cherish their democracy. Political participation allows us to express our deepest held beliefs. When we fight for something we believe in we are true participants in our democracy. I know this is true because I saw it myself. Missourians during the last election, even in the face of grief, went to the polls to make their will known. The 2000 election, however, revealed a number of flaws in our electoral machinery.Far too many Americans were being disenfranchised without their knowledge. Too many voters left the polling places in confusion; too often registration lists had not been properly maintained.The promise of American democracy is that everyone has the right to vote without regard to their individual circumstance. It is our job to make that promise a reality.The Constitution calls for a decentralized system that puts states in charge of elections. But since States hold elections for Federal offices, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to encourage and empower States to improve the voting process. I believe this bill does just that and I am pleased to support it.I congratulate the sponsors and those who have put many hours of hard work to bringing this consensus bill to the floor.This bill is framed around two basic premises: Those who are not properly registered to vote are not allowed to cast a ballot, but for those who are properly registered, we should make it as easy as possible for them to go to the polls, vote, and have their vote counted.To those who say we need additional steps to eliminate voter fraud and punish those who abuse the system, you are correct. We must work harder to put systems in place that will adequately update voter rolls. Many States and local registrars are plagued by insufficient technology, and thus an inability to maintain databases that are current. There must also be adequate voter education so that our citizens understand what steps they must take to register properly. And we must make sure that poll workers receive the appropriate training so that we can reduce any potential issues at the polling places.To those who say we must live up to the promise of our Constitution and do all within our power to bring more people into the process, I say your call must be heard.This Nation's history is built on the fight for suffrage. To place even the lowest hurdle before someone seeking to exercise the right to vote is an affront to our democracy. This bill ensures that we go the extra mile to protect the rights of those populations most vulnerable to disenfranchisement: the elderly, the disabled, those who are not fluent in English, ethnic and racial minorities, and members of the armed services who are serving overseas.Perhaps the most significant reform in this bill is that States will be required to implement a system of provisional voting. From now on, if someone's eligibility is challenged at the polling place, they will have the right to cast a vote. If it turns out that the voter was properly registered, his or her vote will be counted.The bill will also prevent disenfranchisement by updating voting technology. In the future, voters will know if they unintentionally selected more than one candidate for a single office, or if their ballots are not otherwise properly marked, and they will have a chance to correct their ballots, and make sure their vote is counted. It is common sense that when a system is broken, we must mend it.When this system concerns a fundamental and cherished right, it is not only common sense, it is vital to the health of our Nation. Our efforts today to empower voters remind me of the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said:Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country.Let us renew the promise of our great Nation and enact legislation that will promote fairness, enhance participation, and increase our faith in the greatest democracy in the history of the world.,2015-03-17 19:12:05.785607,2015-03-17 19:12:05.785607,Senate,SENATOR DODD'S BABY,2002-02-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-02-14/html/CREC-2002-02-14-pt1-PgS838.htm,14,8,148,S838-S840,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2996,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the Democrat substitute which provides immediate, permanent estate tax reform, but in opposition to H.R. 2341. Small businesses and farm owners should not be penalized for their success, nor should they need to worry about their ability to pass the family business on to future generations, and the substitute addresses these concerns. I continue to oppose complete repeal as proposed in the measure before us because it disproportionately benefits a small number of extremely wealthy individuals and runs our Nation's budget into deeper deficits.In its current form, the estate tax affects less than 2 percent of the wealthiest Americans. As of January 1, 2003, the substitute will immediately increase the estate tax exclusion to $3 million for a single person and $6 million for a married couple. The substitute permanently exempts 99.7 percent of Americans, leaving the tax burden entirely on the wealthiest 0.3 percent of estates. This substitute updates our most progressive tax to affect even fewer families. I continue my support for immediate, permanent estate tax reform, unlike the Republican bill, which will not provide relief until 2011.The Democratic substitute offsets the cost of the estate tax increase, but the Republican bill to totally repeal the estate tax, which costs more than $50 billion per year, comes at the cost of a prescription drug benefit, our children's education, and paying down the debt. I have worked too hard balancing budgets during my 25 years of public service to permit such irresponsible fiscal policy to prevail.Totally repealing the estate tax is contrary to the wishes of two Republican Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, who put this tax in place. In 1907, Theodore Roosevelt said the following regarding this progressive tax, ``Such a tax would be one of the methods by which we should try to preserve a measurable quality of opportunity for the people of the generation growing to manhood.'' During his Inaugural Address in 1909, William Howard Taft said, ``New kinds of taxation must be adopted, and among these I recommend a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection.'' Historically, the richest in our society are the ones who pay the majority of the estate tax, and the original justification for this progressive tax is still applicable today, but reform is needed as our economy and times change.Rick Mos is a small business owner in Kansas City, and he has concerns about the future. His company, High Life Sales Company, is a beer distributor in my district. He supports the reform that has already taken place to raise the exemptions and decrease the tax rates, and he supports permanent reform. He does not, however, support permanent repeal. He told me that if it were not for the estate tax, the wealthiest Americans would lose a necessary incentive to create charitable foundations which help all of our communities. Two of the largest charitable foundations in my district, the Kauffman foundation and the Hall foundation, have donated millions of dollars to the Kansas City community, including the construction of a state-of-the-art concert hall which is scheduled to be completed in 2007. Would there be as much money available if the estate tax was repealed? It is unlikely. Ewing Kaufman and Joyce Hall were great philanthropists, but they were also businessmen, and they recognized the tax benefits of giving to charity under the estate tax. Voting for H.R. 2341 repeals this charitable incentive.Mr. Mos supports the Democratic substitute, but not a total repeal. We are hearing a lot of Members today talk about small business owners and farmers, but how many of you have spoken to small business owners in your district? I am sure you will find many constituents with the same beliefs as Mr. Mos.Many of our Nation's billionaires have bonded together to form an organization called Responsible Wealth. Warren Buffet, one of the group's founders, argues that repealing the estate tax would be equivalent to ``choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold medal winners in the 2000 Olympics.''Let's do what is responsible for America and permanently reform the estate tax but not repeal it.,2015-03-17 19:12:06.060802,2015-03-17 19:12:06.060802,House,PERMANENT DEATH TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2002,2002-06-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-06-06/html/CREC-2002-06-06-pt1-PgH3238-2.htm,73,141,148,H3238-H3276,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
2997,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,I thank my good friend from North Dakota and assure him I hope to be brief and to the point. I am somewhat disappointed I will not share all that testimony with my colleagues, but there will be another opportunity.I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his kind indulgence.Today I rise to join in expressing my concern about recent accounting practices in publicly held companies and their auditors. As a former State auditor, I have an interest in that profession being performed properly. Obviously, something is seriously broken. We hear about Enron, Global Crossing, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen. The people of America are very concerned. We have seen millions of families with their investments diminished or even wiped out. That is not acceptable. The vast majority of investments were not in the volatile sectors, or not what we thought were the volatile sectors of the stock market. They were invested in the so-called blue chip companies. The families who made those investments on their strong belief in the integrity of our financial markets and accounting industry now find that because of corporate shams, accounting gimmicks, and inadequate auditing, they have lost significantly the investments they planned for education or retirement--for their families.As far as we know, overall the overwhelming majority of publicly traded companies are in full compliance with corporate accounting standards. But the fact that there has been a significant deception by a handful of companies raises suspicions of all companies. In addition, we don't know how many others will come forward in coming weeks.We must restore the public's confidence in the market. Without this, the economic recovery which should be beginning will remain elusive.While much of the focus in the debate here and in the news media is on the auditing problems of the big conglomerate companies, unfortunately little attention has been paid in this bill to how the impact will fall on small publicly traded companies and small auditing firms. As the ranking member on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have some concerns, after reviewing this bill, that we may be pushing ahead without considering the serious effect and the unintended consequences the bill could have on smaller firms--both small auditing firms and small publicly traded companies.The bill is clearly targeted towards abuses in extremely large businesses, which we all think should be dealt with. I personally hope it will result in prison sentences for people who are proven to have committed criminal acts in their accounting activities.But the SEC is not even aware of how many small auditing firms there are auditing small, publicly traded companies. There are some 2,500 small companies, and we believe many of them are audited by small- and medium-size auditing firms. For small auditors, the bill will require many new elements including registration, annual filing requirements, as well as partnership rotation of lead auditors. In addition, the bill would codify a list of banned services or nonauditing services that an auditing company might conduct for a company that it audits.While some of these elements clearly are necessary to restore confidence, and I think are going to be dealt with by regulatory action and maybe even by the industry itself, no one knows how these requirements will affect the small firms. It has been argued that the bill allows for a case-by-case exemption, but that exemption process itself could be extremely costly and untimely for small firms and lead to inconsistent results.I fear that some of these small auditing firms will not have the resources to implement these requirements and will stop auditing services or just go out of business. The result may be that small, publicly traded companies may not be able to obtain auditing services at reasonable cost. As a result, the bill might be setting up a hurdle for small companies to reach the public markets, one that is too expensive and too great to overcome.Clearly, when we deal with the major problems we ought not cause significant problems for the smaller, growing entrepreneurial sector of our country.As for publicly traded companies, the bill also places new requirements for auditing committees and for corporate responsibility. Again, many of these may be necessary. However, we need to look at how these requirements will affect the small, publicly traded companies.The entrepreneurial spirit of our country is really the envy of the world. People know that entrepreneurship works in America. That is where we get the new ideas. That is where we get the growth. That is where we get the new services and the products. We should be careful as we adopt reforms not to put a disproportionate burden on these companies, dampening the entrepreneurial spirit or impeding access to the public markets.I fully support accounting reform and the taking of steps necessary to restore investor confidence in the market. I think we should pass a balanced bill that will not overburden small firms and not create additional hurdles that will impede them from growing. We don't want an incidental consequence of this bill to be a monopoly of large accounting firms when it comes to corporate audits.I agree with the other speakers that the American public is looking to us for answers. I intend to work to see that the needs of the small businesses, publicly traded small companies, and small auditing firms are protected. I am committed, and I think we all are committed, to restoring the public's confidence in the markets so families can feel safe once again in investing in America and in America's future.I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure a balanced bill which will do that without bringing unnecessary hardship on the entrepreneurial sector of our economy.I thank my colleague from Wyoming for the courtesy in allowing me to go ahead.

2998,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, we are all familiar with our changing demographics. Those once a part of the baby boom are now well on their way to creating a senior boom. By the year 2020, one in six Americans will be age 65 or over. By 2040, the number of seniors aged 85 and older will more than triple from about 4 million to 14 million. This boom will create a dramatic increase in the demand for services for seniors especially long-term care.Long-term care is more than just health care. It includes any services that seniors need to maintain their quality of life, such as transportation, nutrition, or other supports that help seniors live independently.Long-term care can mean help with buying groceries, paying bills each month, getting dressed in the morning, getting a ride to the doctor's office, or taking medicine at the appropriate time. We need to make sure our society is ready to provide these kinds of services for seniors, and we need to make sure that we give seniors options. We need to be creative in what we offer.Last year I learned about an innovative option for providing long-term care services for seniors. The concept is based on naturally occurring retirement communities, NORCs. A naturally occurring retirement community develops in a community or neighborhood where residents remain for years and age as neighbors. A NORC may be a large apartment building or a street of single family homes. According to AARP, about 27 percent of seniors currently live in NORCs. NORCs represent a new model for giving seniors the support services they need. We can bring services directly to seniors, and we can help enhance their quality of life and allow them to age in place.This is important because most seniors prefer living in their own homes. To address the need for long-term care services, I secured $1.2 million last year to establish a NORC project in downtown St. Louis. To get this project underway, first there will be assessment of residents' needs. The funds will then be used to meet these individual needs. Residents will receive such services as individual case management, family education, wellness services, and other needed supports.The St. Louis program is only the first step. This unique model could be used to deliver support services to seniors in communities across the country. That is why I am pleased to introduce the Senior Self-Sufficiency Act. This legislation would lay the foundation for a new way of helping seniors stay in their own homes and in their own communities. The Senior Self-Sufficiency Act would create ten demonstration projects in naturally occurring retirement communities across the country. Each would last 4 years. The grant would be used to provide comprehensive support services to seniors.The services offered would be created to meet the individual needs of the residents and to help them maintain their independence. Funds would also be used to make housing improvements that would allow seniors to live in their own neighborhoods longer. For example, they could install safety bars in bathrooms or replace stairs with wheelchair ramps. Two of the ten projects would be located in rural areas where access to services is often harder or more distant. We will learn from the research how best to expand the program to all areas of the country.If given the choice, most people would prefer to grow older in their own homes, surrounded by friends and family. This is exactly what this legislation will allow seniors to do. By making support services available to seniors in their own homes, we can extend the time they live independently, and we can improve their quality of life. We can provide services at lower cost, and we can start preparing now for the future needs of our population.I am pleased to announce that the Senior Self-Sufficiency Act has the support of the Missouri Department of Health and the Jewish Federation of St. Louis.I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-17 19:12:06.644217,2015-03-17 19:12:06.644217,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2002-08-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-08-01/html/CREC-2002-08-01-pt2-PgS7903.htm,108,10,148,S7903-S7964,C001043,mrs. carnahan
2999,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, today I am reminded that 2 years ago when I came to the Senate, it was with a heavy heart. Life had not turned out the way it was supposed to. My husband, not I, was supposed to have been sworn in to the Senate, and I was to be seated in the gallery, beaming with delight at the shared victory we had won.As someone has pointed out, life is not the way it is supposed to be. Life is the way it is, and it is the way we cope with it that makes a difference. I had some difficult lessons to learn in that regard.It was not by chance when I stepped down from the dais, after being sworn in, that the first to welcome me was Senator Joe Biden. He had come to this Chamber many years ago after a tragic loss in his own life. He told me the story of having been greeted by Senator McClellan of Arkansas, who looked him in the eye and said: Work, hard work, it is the sure path to healing.Senator Biden said: I thought at the time how callous that advice was; he just does not understand the hurt I am feeling. He later found out Senator McClellan spoke from having experienced a family tragedy of overwhelming proportion. Joe Biden took the advice to heart and he passed it on to me. You were right, Joe, and I thank you for that wisdom.There has been much work to throw ourselves into during the 107th Congress. It has been a monumental period in our Nation's history, a time marred by unprecedented national tragedy, deep political divisions, economic upheavals, corporate corruption, continued threats to our national security, and now the gathering clouds of war. Through all of these disasters, we have seen the triumph of the American spirit. Yes, Americans have taken to heart the advice Louis Pasteur once gave to a group of young people. He said: Do not let yourselves be discouraged by the sadness of certain hours which passes over nations.Thankfully, the Congress has refused to be discouraged. We have endured anthrax attacks, dismantled offices, tighter security measures, major alterations to the Capitol complex, not to mention three shifts in legislative leadership. Through it all, we have managed to address a number of important issues. We passed a historic tax cut, reformed education, overhauled campaign finance laws, called corporate America to a higher standard, and prepared our Nation to respond to global terrorism. We have found that being the guardian of freedom is a relentless and consuming work. The immensity of our task would cripple a lesser people. Rather than be cowered by events, America and her institutions have always been emboldened during times of crisis. I am convinced the Author of Liberty, who has blessed and protected our Nation in the past, will enable us to meet the stern responsibilities of the present.As the 108th Congress takes on this new burden, I will not be among them but my prayers will be with them. I leave realizing that to have served in the Senate for even a short while is an honor afforded very few in their lifetime. I am forever grateful to the people of Missouri who have allowed me and my family to serve them for three generations. Reporters often ask me to reflect on those years. Most recently, I was asked what impressed me most during my time in the Senate. And I replied it was the diligence beyond duty shown by all who are part of this Chamber--Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Staff, parliamentarians, clerks, pages, security officers, maintenance workers, elevator operators, all spend long hours serving America. For the most part, their names, their selfless deeds will go unrecorded, but their life and work demonstrate a deep devotion to duty.In recognition of the loyalty and exemplary work of my own staff, I ask unanimous consent to have their names printed in the Record at the close of my remarks.,2015-03-17 19:12:06.931420,2015-03-17 19:12:06.931420,Senate,FAREWELL TO THE SENATE,2002-11-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-11-18/html/CREC-2002-11-18-pt1-PgS11238.htm,149,0,148,S11238-S11239,C001043,mrs. carnahan
3000,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, as we begin the 107th Congress and our debate turns to our national security, I want to remind our colleagues that we must remain vigilant in protecting the greatest asset in our defense arsenal, our military personnel. Without our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, we cannot sail our ships, fly our fighters, or put boots on the ground to protect our Nation's interests here and abroad.Our highly qualified, well-trained military personnel are the core of our Nation's defense. I am concerned that the new administration will rush to fund high visibility weapons systems with important political constituencies, like the National Missile Defense, at the expense of ensuring that our military personnel remain the best in the world.I believe we must make every effort to continue to recruit quality service members to ensure the continued success of our Armed Forces. With the good economic times, rising numbers of high school graduates going on to college, low unemployment, myriad job opportunities in the private sector, and a whole host of other factors, it is no secret that the military services have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting and retaining enough qualified individuals.Last year, all of the services reached their yearly recruiting goals for enlisted active duty personnel, but this success was not easily achieved. For example, the Air Force, which historically has an easier time recruiting, had to establish a special task force in order to improve its recruiting program. This year, the services are forecasting that they will each make their active duty recruiting goals for enlisted personnel. Time will tell.Active duty recruiting is not the only challenge facing the services. Maintaining a suitable reserve force to provide the additional support for our military is also a daunting challenge. Last year, two of the seven reserve components, the Navy Reserve and the Air Force Reserve, missed their enlisted recruiting goals.Currently, the Army National Guard and the Naval Reserve are both on a path to miss their projected goals for this fiscal year. Both the Army and the Air National Guard are struggling to meet a higher recruiting mission with fewer recruiters than last year. With our growing dependence on the Guard and the Reserve, these difficulties are a cause for serious concern. Unlike years past, our military cannot operate effectively without the participation of the National Guard and Reserve. So we must do everything possible to ensure that we devote sufficient resources to Reserve and Guard recruiting.Retaining those highly trained service members who are already in the military is also vitally important. We cannot afford to lose the investment we make in our service members by failing to provide adequate education, training, working conditions and quality of life to make military service an attractive career option. Today, highly skilled, motivated individuals are being enticed to leave the military and to use their skills and expertise in the private sector. We simply cannot allow this trend to continue if we hope to remain the world's most foremost military power.Last year, enlisted retention was a particularly acute problem for the Air Force. In the officer corps, the Army missed its officer retention goal by 1,069 while the Air Force was short 523. Many officers who leave are in the junior officer ranks. These are the leaders of tomorrow; and if we hope to keep them in the military, we must be responsive to their needs and concerns.Spending on high-tech weapons systems is important, but we simply cannot afford to neglect the people side of our defense equation. The personnel and compensation systems of today are based on outdated notions which do not make sense for the 21st Century. For example, the up or out promotion system may not make the most sense in an era where we have computer experts who aspire only to work with computers for their entire careers.We need to revisit how the services fill critical specialty positions. The current retirement system, which penalizes those who do not stay for a full 20-year career, clearly merits scrutiny. And although the Committee on Armed Services addressed retiree health care last year, it is clear to me that the TRICARE system, which also serves the active duty and reserve communities, is broken and needs to be fixed.If we do not attend to these people programs, all the sophisticated weapons systems in the world will not do us any good because we will not have enough people who are smart enough and well trained enough to operate them.We simply cannot afford to let that happen. Therefore, as we begin this new millennium, let us renew our commitment to the dedicated men and women who serve in our Nation's military and to ensuring that our Nation's Armed Forces continue to be the best trained, most highly qualified force in the 21st Century.,2015-03-17 19:12:07.339711,2015-03-17 19:12:07.339711,House,PROTECTING OUR GREATEST MILITARY ASSET: OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL,2001-02-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-02-06/html/CREC-2001-02-06-pt1-PgH190.htm,16,1,147,H190-H191,S000465,mr. skelton
