301,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the Democratic Leadership Substitute and in opposition to the Republican Budget, H. Con. Res. 393, which fails to meet the fiscal and societal challenges Americans face today. While the Republican budget focuses on a tax cut for only a few, slashes important funding for health care, veterans, education and environmental programs, and does little to revive the economy, the Democratic plan is a fiscally responsible solution to balance the budget, reign in the deficit, fund priorities, and promote job creation and economic growth.The Democratic Leadership Substitute achieves a balanced federal budget within eight years and invests in meaningful job creation, education, veterans benefits, environmental protection, infrastructure and economic development.Since 2001, the economy has lost more than 3 million private sector jobs. In the Kansas City Metropolitan Area in the past three years, 21,300 jobs have been lost. The Republican proposal we are considering today continues the Administration's same failed economic policies, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has concluded will have, at best, a small impact on the economy over the next five years. Alternatively, the Democratic substitute promotes job creation by restoring funding to small business loan programs, job training and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program. Additionally, it extends temporary federal unemployment benefits for workers looking for jobs and extended tax cuts, such as the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief.The Republican budget does not adequately fund our nation's top priority: homeland security. Of particular concern is its failure to fully fund our first responders including police, firefighters, and emergency medical service technicians. Federal funds for first responders is a top concern in my district and across the country, and the Democratic substitute ensures these needs by providing $5 billion in additional funding over the next five years. As a member of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, I support adequate funding for state and local governments to prevent and prepare for any type of terrorist threat.The Democratic budget also restores funding to important veterans programs that the Republican resolution cuts. It provides the full funding level, $32.3 billion, requested for 2005 by the Committee on Veterans Affairs. Additionally, it includes $6.6 billion more than the Republican budget over the next five years for critical health needs.The Republican budget resolution shortchanges authorized education programs by approximately $9 billion just as many costly federal mandates, such as annual testing and highly qualified teacher requirements, will take effect. It is unacceptable to impose federal mandates on the states without the funding necessary to fulfill them. As a formal teacher, I understand how important education is to the future of our children. The Republican budget also proposes the smallest overall increase for education programs in nine years. Additionally, it falls further behind on fully funding special education by proposing only a 0.5 percent increase in funding. Finally, it freezes Pell Grant funding, making college unaffordable for millions of low income students. Alternatively, the Democratic substitute provides $9.8 billion more for education and training programs over the next five years. It also restores $3.7 billion for Pell grants and additional funding to make college loans more affordable.The federal budget resolution must fulfill the priorities of the American people. It must be fiscally responsible in ensuring our security, providing adequate funding for domestic programs, putting Americans back to work and balancing the budget. With passage of the Democratic Leadership Substitute, we can work together to put the priorities of the American people first.Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget resolution fails to meet the fiscal challenges Americans face today and slashes programs that are their lifeline. I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic substitute as a more realistic budgetary solution that funds programs essential to those who seek the American dream.,2015-03-16 17:57:37.119534,2015-03-16 17:57:37.119534,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005,2004-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-25/html/CREC-2004-03-25-pt1-PgH1495-2.htm,39,232,150,H1495-H1565,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
302,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today--at least a few moments are justified--in offering some words to help the Nation celebrate the Brown v. Board of Education decision that occurred 50 years ago. It is a good thing we remember and honor that decision. That case was the culmination of a strategy by the NAACP and others that attacked racial segregation at its heart and, by the way, also a decision that redeemed the Supreme Court's record in cases of this kind because we should not forget the Court had earlier placed its imprimatur on slavery in 1856 in the Dred Scott decision and had subsequently placed its imprimatur on the Jim Crow decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. It was, indeed, time in 1954 for the Supreme Court to stand up for the Constitution and live up to the promises of the Declaration of Independence, specifically the promise that all of us are created equal, at least in this sense: that we are equal in our right to enjoy the inalienable rights that Almighty God gives us simply by virtue of the fact that we are people and have human dignity.The history of the United States is, in one sense, a history of a progressive realization of that promise that in fact had been made in theory in the Declaration and also an understanding by the American people that unless that promise is realized and enjoyed by everybody, it is secure for nobody. Brown v. Board of Education was a milestone in that realization.I do want to make the point that the Supreme Court's decision in Brown was not an isolated act of courage by nine Justices, although it was certainly a courageous decision. It was, as I said before, the culmination of a strategy by the NAACP, but also years of advocacy by that group and other groups around the country and thousands of Americans on their own who refused to accept the assumptions underlying racial segregation and, indeed, refused to let the American people go on year after year quietly and in an unthinking way accepting those assumptions.That activity by thousands and thousands of people in protests, in op-ed pieces, in books they wrote, in appearances on mass media, and just the way they conducted their day-to-day lives changed public opinion, by no means entirely in 1954 but enough so that the Brown v. Board of Education decision became possible, in a way that it would not have been possible--clearly was not possible in 1934 or even 1944.The same Supreme Court, staffed by the same nine Justices, would not and did not issue a decision such as Brown v. Board of Education 20 years earlier or 10 years earlier because those people had not yet done enough of their work to move enough of the American people toward the right conclusion that that decision became possible.In that sense, I suggest that people such as Jackie Robinson and others around the country probably did more to desegregate the schools than the Supreme Court did in Brown v. Board of Education, and certainly people such as Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King did more to ensure the implementation in practice of the Brown v. Board of Education than the Federal courts did.I want to dedicate this day on which we justly celebrate the decision to the thousands of people, some who are recorded in history and some who have remained anonymous, who made that decision possible and helped correct a tremendous injustice and redeem America's honor before the bar of history.The Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, changed laws, and that is hard, as we know in the Senate.Those other folks, in standing up for the rights of their fellow citizens, changed hearts, and that is even more difficult.,2015-03-16 17:57:37.286647,2015-03-16 17:57:37.286647,Senate,BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION,2004-05-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-05-17/html/CREC-2004-05-17-pt1-PgS5505-2.htm,69,0,150,S5505-S5510,T000024,mr. talent
303,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I have been listening with a great deal of interest as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed their views on education. I particularly commend my neighbor and colleague from Kansas and my good friend from Idaho for their very perceptive comments about education.As I listen to the debate back and forth, it is clear we have two very different approaches to education being championed. On the one side, we have trust of local schools; on the other side, we have mistrust.On one side, we advocate local control; on the other side, they advocate Federal control.On our side, we say that parents, schools, teachers, and school boards know best. On the other side, they say Washington knows best.For me it is not a tough choice. This is not rocket science: trust, local control, parents, schools know best. There is no question in my mind.I come to the Senate floor today to say--and I have said it before and I will say it again--I spent my adult career working with parents, teachers, and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I have watched their education decisions. I spent the last 13 years in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal bureaucracy administer programs.When it comes to wasting money, it is not even close. It is not a contest. It is a good thing that local schools do not operate as does the Federal Government because local schools could not afford to. Luckily, schools are far better at applying resources to the needs of children in their schools. Unfortunately, the Federal bureaucracy has been good at creating waste, misdirected priorities, red tape, and unnecessary hassles and regulations.As it is the case in other areas as well, our congressional zest to provide assistance has become part of the problem--our good intentions. And they are good intentions. Nobody questions the intentions. When the Congress went about creating 765 programs, every single one of them was a good idea. Unfortunately, it was at the wrong place. It was a good idea in Washington, not a good idea at the local school level.Our good intentions have become burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, mounds of paperwork, and unwanted meddling. We have created a system where parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom.Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials, we have empowered the Federal Government and the bureaucrats. We have been slowly eroding the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have put a system in place where the Olympians on the hill pretend to know what is best for the peasants in the valley.We need to be bold enough to stand up and admit that these good intentions have gone astray. Our good intentions are failing our public schools and, most importantly, they are failing our children. Let's recognize what we do not know in Washington has become obvious. Washington does not always know best, especially when it comes to micromanaging the education of children in local schools throughout this country.What is wrong with giving control of education to local schools and to the States? What happened to everyone saying that education is a national priority but a local responsibility? I firmly believe that is true. If that were true, and the other side trusted those at the local level, this debate would not be as controversial as it is.What is wrong with letting classroom teachers, principals, and school boards fashion plans to improve learning and achievement in their own schools?Back in my home State of Missouri, no one thinks the answer to improving public education lies within the Halls of Congress or in the granite buildings in downtown Washington's Department of Education.Almost everyone I have talked to will say: Stay out of the way and give the local schools the opportunity.Missourians know, and I know, that the real solutions--the laboratories--are the local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not have to play the ``Mother, May I'' game with Washington, DC.My colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep talking about class size, afterschool programs, and numerous other programs. These will be new programs, with new mandates, and new responsibilities for schools directly controlled and regulated by Washington, smothered with reports and regulations and redtape. Is this the direction we want to go? I do not think so. This will only exacerbate the ``Mother, May I'' game.As we debate ESEA today, I hope we will keep certain things in perspective. One of those things is how much money the Federal Government actually provides to the local school district and what amount of Federal involvement is appropriate with the amount of funding provided.I have heard over and over again that the Federal Government provides less than 10 percent of a local school district's budget. Yet the Federal Government accounts for over 50 percent of the local school district's paperwork burden. How can any of us justify this proportion of Federal meddling and paperwork burden for less than 10 percent of the district's funding? In my State of Missouri, on average, Federal funding accounts for only 6 percent of the local school district's budget.My great State of Missouri has some wonderful teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members--some of the best in the country. I cannot believe my colleagues are not hearing the same thing from their constituents that I am hearing from mine. If you are not, I suggest you are not listening. Go back and ask them. They will tell you. However, just in case you have not heard, let me share some of the things I have been told.The Superintendent of Springfield Public Schools in Missouri said:The amount of paperwork that the federal government causes local school districts to engage in is often overwhelming. That extra effort and time often reduces productive classroom time and energy that could better be spent working directly with children.Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV School in Missouri said:Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had in mind.From Neosho R-5, in Missouri:The individuals working most closely with the students are indeed the ones who can best decide how this money can be spent for the benefit of students' education.From the Superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County, MO:As head of a school district specializing in special education, I fully understand how my district's financial needs differ from other school districts' needs. In order to best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those funds to the best use.From the Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School District in Missouri:Without local control, the focus is taken away from the needs specific to the children in each school system.I think the Superintendent of the Taneyville R-II School District in Missouri sums it up well:I feel that the State and Federal government has tied our school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school does this; pull it another way and the school does that. School systems and communities are as different from one another as individual people are different. What works for one will not work for another.These are the types of comments I have heard over the past couple years. These comments led to the development of my Direct Check for Education proposal that is S. 52.As introduced, S. 52 took six Department of Education programs, primarily competitive grant programs, and combined them and determined that the funding would go out based on average daily attendance in school districts. It would give school districts added flexibility.I intend to offer an amendment that would allow us to try this as a demonstration program.I know it is hard sometimes to get Governors to support this concept. But I stand here as a recovering Governor. I know that Governors and States have the responsibility for welfare programs, State transportation programs; but the responsibility for directly delivering student education rests in the hands of those at the local level.Let's give them the opportunity to demonstrate they can deliver. States can still establish standards and requirements. They still have the ability to control their local school districts. What I am saying, with Direct Check, is to keep their hands out of the bureaucratic maze that the Federal Government imposes on them. I hope my colleagues will take a look at that proposal when I offer it.Another area I am looking at very carefully is having an amendment on Impact Aid. Impact Aid is one of the oldest Federal education programs, dating from the 1950s, and is meant to compensate local school districts for the ``substantial and continuing financial burdens'' resulting from Federal activities. These ``activities'' include Federal ownership of land, such as military installations or Indian reservation lands, as well as local school enrollment of children whose parents work on Federal property. It is a Federal responsibility.In my State, we have two outstanding military bases: Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base. I would argue it is a quality-of-life issue for our military and one we must address. I look forward to working on it with my colleagues. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma will be working on it.I also offer my support, in advance, for an amendment I have been working on for some time with Senators Stevens and Jeffords, along with a number of our other colleagues, that focuses on early childhood education and development.While most of the debate this week will be about elementary and secondary education--the years of what we might call ``formal schooling''--the education and mental development of a child, however, begins long before that child enters kindergarten. In fact, the education and development of a child begins practically at birth. From the experiences we have had in Missouri with parents and teachers, we know that those first 3 years are vitally important. Giving the parents the right tools to help that child get started can make a tremendously important difference in the educational achievement of that child throughout that child's educational experience.The amendment the Senators from Vermont and Alaska will offer recognizes these basic facts; that the education and mental development and entire development of a child begins early in life. Through this amendment, we hope to support families with the youngest children to find the early childhood educational programs that can help those families and parents provide the supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children need.The amendment recognizes that if we want to do everything possible for our Nation's children and their overall education, we need to focus on the earliest years, as well as the years of formal schooling. We can do this--and this amendment proposes to do this--by supporting and expanding the successful early childhood programs and initiatives that are working right now at the local level. I invite anybody to come to Missouri to see how well these programs work.I am pleased to say the amendment is based on the basic ideas and principles set forth in legislation that I was pleased to introduce several years ago with my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.Mr. President, it is my opinion that if we want to improve our public education system to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement, we must take the stranglehold of the Federal Government off the local school districts and the States and give the resources directly to those local school districts and States so they can do their job.I look forward to supporting an amendment by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, which deals with some of the very serious problems that the current IDEA imposes. Talk to any school official, any schoolteacher, any school personnel in Missouri, and they will tell you they are scared because the requirements of IDEA put other students, teachers, and school personnel at risk from dangerously violent students who sometimes carry guns and are sheltered by the Federal regulations that come with the individual education program. We should not have a Federal Government program that puts people associated with schools at risk. We need to change the laws to protect and nurture those with IEPs but not to expose those with whom they deal to violence and perhaps even to guns.In closing, we must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, and school boards because education decisions can best be made by educators, board members, parents, teachers, and local school officials who know the names and the needs of the children in their schools. I hope we will be spending our time debating education, not every issue under the Sun that may come up as an effort to derail this vitally important reform of our education system.Our children deserve the reform this bill delivers. This ESEA bill deals with one of the most important national priorities, and that is education. It deals with it by moving the control and the responsibility out of Washington and back into the real world where the best decisions can be made. I look forward to working with my colleagues.I thank the floor manager, the chairman of the committee, for allowing me the extra time. I look forward to continuing the debate and working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve successful ESEA reform, with perhaps some of the bells and whistles added that I have mentioned.

304,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to honor the new Lincoln University President, Dr. David B. Henson. On April 4, 1998, Dr. Henson will gather with friends, family, colleagues, faculty, and students to be inaugurated as the seventeenth President of Lincoln University which opened its doors on September 17, 1866, in Jefferson City, Missouri as the Lincoln Institute.Dr. Henson has a twenty-five year history of service to higher education. The list of educational institutions he has served is a prestigious one. At Howard University College of Medicine, Dr. Henson served as the Acting Chairperson in the Department of Biochemistry, the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, and an Associate Professor of Biochemistry. At Yale College, he was the Dean of Student Affairs and the Associate Dean. Dr. Henson's work in the fields of science is commendable. He was a Lecturer in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and a Fellow in Timothy Dwight College at Yale University, a Professor of Chemistry at Alabama A&amp;M, and a Provost and Professor of Chemistry at the Broward Campus of Florida Atlantic University. Furthermore, at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Dr. Henson held the position of Associate Vice Chancellor of Academic Services and Student Support Services. Dr. Henson also served as Vice President of Student Services at Purdue University.President Henson is actively involved in state and local community services. He is an honorary member of Purdue Iron Key Society; a member of the Executive 21 Continuous Quality Improvement Steering Committee; a steward at St. John's AME Church in Huntsville; on the National Committee on International Science and Education; on the Education Committee, U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center; and on the Board of Huntsville Boy's and Girl's Clubs of America.Dr. Henson contributes his services to Missouri organizations as well. He currently is the Treasurer of the Council on Public Higher Education of Missouri; on the Board of Directors with the Jefferson Chamber of Commerce; on the Board of Governors at Capital Region Medical Canter; a member of the Steering Committee for the River Rendezvous; an active member of the Rotary Club of Jefferson City; and a member of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Central Missouri Celebration Planning Committee.To his credit, Dr. Henson has received the African Americans Who Make a Difference Award, the Howard University College of Medicine Student Council's Award for Excellence in Teaching, the George Washington Carver Research Foundation Student Award, and an American Council on Education Fellowship.For this lifetime of service to education and commitment to community involvement, I rise today to recognize and salute Dr. David B. Henson as he becomes the seventeenth President of Lincoln University. I think I speak for all Missourians when I say that we are grateful that he has chosen a Missouri university to continue his service to higher education.,2015-03-16 17:57:37.575851,2015-03-16 17:57:37.575851,Senate,HONORING DR.

305,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, if the National Endowment for the Arts is terminated and a State block grant is enacted, local communities will suffer tremendous losses, educationally, culturally and economically. Under the block grant, less than $50 million would be directed to the States for school-based art education programs. Currently, there are approximately 51 million students enrolled in primary and secondary schools. Thus, under the block grant each child would receive less than $1 for arts education activities. Dispensing funds in such piddling amounts is tantamount to throwing that money away.During its 31-year history, the NEA has fostered the placement of thousands of artists-in-residence in our public schools and has allowed for the creation of literacy programs and children's festivals. In partnership with the Department of Education, the NEA assists over 100 national arts and education organizations to implement arts education in the curriculum. The NEA has also assisted universities in providing training for teachers and faculty, including national research on the effects of arts education on cognitive learning. The block grant would eliminate funding to universities, as well as lifelong learning programs that serve our Nation's adults, senior citizens, and disabled citizens.In addition to improved quality of life and education, the NEA has made a very positive contribution to our Nation's economy. Through grants to orchestras, theaters, music ensembles, and other cultural festivals, the arts industry has supported nearly a million jobs across the Nation. In turn, these jobs have resulted in billions of dollars in revenue to the Federal Government. Local economies have seen the benefits of the arts through increased hotel stays and increased sales in local restaurants and shops.Supporters of the block grant of Federal arts funding argue that it allows more equitable funding to all congressional districts. This is simply untrue. Under the Ehlers funding formula, funds to State arts agencies would be cut below the fiscal year 1997 level, which was already reduce 40 percent under the fiscal year 1996 budget cut. It is unlikely that these limited State funds will actually reach local programs, particularly in the Nation's poorest and most isolated counties. NEA programs, such as Chamber Music Rural Residences--that have brought chamber music and jazz ensembles to rural areas, including Tifton, GA, Jesup, IA, and Blytheville, AR--would be eliminated. A block grant would likely neglect those art and culture groups that have been historically underserved, groups such as the native American woodcarvers and the black American dance troupes.The NEA has brought art to people in small towns and rural areas throughout the United States. The NEA has helped to educate and enlighten the young and the old. The NEA has enriched urban and rural communities across this country, financially as well as culturally.The Ehlers amendment makes no effort to promote effective development of, and access to, the arts. The Ehlers amendment does not endeavor to make effective use of scarce Federal resources. Rather, to please a fringe group that regard art as synonymous with sin, the Ehlers amendment would scatter those funds to the winds in amounts too small to make a difference. I urge rejection to the Ehlers approach.,2015-03-16 17:57:37.733965,2015-03-16 17:57:37.733965,House,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-07-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-07-15/html/CREC-1997-07-15-pt1-PgH5266.htm,100,5,143,H5266-H5272,C000488,mr. clay
306,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to extreme Republican anti-labor riders in this legislation.I had thought the radical House Republicans had learned their lesson last year, when the legislative riders that they added to appropriations bills led to two government shutdowns. Here they go again, with two special interest provisions designed to weaken an agency that protects both working Americans and, ironically, many employees.To start with, this bill already imposes a draconian cut in the budget of the National Labor Relations Board--a fifteen percent cut from the current level, and a twenty percent cut from the President's request. Cuts of these magnitude will only result in increasingly growing backlogs--backlogs that are in the interest of neither employees nor employers. But the special interests served by this bill don't care.The first rider would prohibit the issuance of a final single location bargaining unit rule by the NLRB. But if Republicans were true to their principles, they would be supporting, not opposing, the issuance of a final rule.Indeed, such a rule, by minimizing the need for case-by-case adjudication, would reduce expensive litigation and resultant delay. This would promote certainty, for the benefit for both labor and management. In addition, a rule would promote the more efficient use of Board resources, a crucial consideration in light of the drastic cuts in the Board's budget proposed in this bill. By opposing such a rule, the Republican are showing their hypocrisy.The second rider would effectively force the NLRB to raise its business volume threshold for exercising jurisdiction over labor disputes. This is a major policy change that should not be adopted in haste on an appropriations bill.Ironically, this change would not necessarily reduce the NLRB's workload, since jurisdiction would become an issue in many more cases.Indeed, this rider shows how blind the sponsors are to the role and function of the Labor Board. The NLRB is a referee that maintains the rules of the game for both labor and management. It protects both employees and employers. The supporters of this amendment want to take away the NLRB's jurisdiction over smaller employers and restore the law of the jungle.Is this really what the supporters of this rider want to see--the law of the jungle? Do the supporters of this rider really want to decrease protections for small employers? That's what this rider would do. Perhaps that's why both labor and management experts oppose this rider.These riders are just another example of the extreme anti-labor animus of the House Republican leadership. They don't care about the facts, they don't care about the law, they don't care about the procedure, they just know they hate labor.Let's strike these extreme riders from this bill. Let's help prevent another government shutdown.Ms. ESHOO, Mr. Chairman, the shortsightedness of this bill should be obvious to us all. Inadequate funding for education compromises our children's future and the future of our nation.Listen carefully to what's not being funded:Compensatory Education--$475 million less.Safe &amp; Drug Free Schools--$99 million less.Special Education--$306 million less.Bilingual Education--$94 million less.Goals 2000--eliminated.Mr. Chairman, one cannot cut these programs without serious ramifications. Funding for education is an investment that we can and must make a priority.I return to my district every weekend and one of the issues I consistently hear from my constituents about is the importance of education. Education is the very foundation upon which our nation is built and it is what will determine the very future of our citizenry and our country.I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to oppose this shortsighted bill.,2015-03-16 17:57:37.891077,2015-03-16 17:57:37.891077,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997,1996-07-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-11/html/CREC-1996-07-11-pt1-PgH7327-3.htm,102,391,142,H7327-H7374,C000488,mr. clay
307,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an original cosponsor with Senator Bob Kerrey of the ``Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998.'' This bill seeks to address an unintended inequity in federal support for graduate medical education. If not addressed, this inequity will jeopardize the future of the pediatric health care work force as well as the pediatric biomedical research enterprise for our nation's children.Specifically, this bill will provide capped, time-limited, interim commensurate federal funding for the nearly 60 independent children's teaching hospitals, including the children's hospitals in Kansas City and St. Louis, which are so important to the training of the nation's physicians who serve children. They are equally important to the conduct of research to benefit children's health and health care.Let me illustrate the magnitude of the inequity in federal investment in graduate medical attention (GME). In 1977, the federal Medicare program reimbursed teaching hospitals, on average, more than $76,000 for each resident trained. In contrast, Medicare reimbursed independent children's teaching hospitals--children's hospitals that do not share a Medicare provider number with a larger medical institution--less than $400 per resident, because children's hospitals care for children, not the elderly, and therefore do not serve Medicare patients, except for a small number of children with end stage renal disease.Until recently, this inequity was not a problem as long as all payers of health care were willing to reimburse teaching hospitals enough for their patient care to cover the extra costs of GME. As the health care market has become increasingly competitive, it has become harder and harder for all teaching hospitals to generate patient care revenues to help cover their GME costs. But only independent children's teaching hospitals face these competitive pressures without the significant federal GME support, which the rest of the teaching hospital community relies upon.This is more than a problem for the financial well-being of the education programs of a small number of children's hospitals--less than one percent of the nation's hospitals. It is a problem for our entire pediatric workforce and pediatric research enterprise, because these institutions play such a disproportionately large role in academic medicine for children. On average, their education programs are equal in size to the GME programs of all teaching hospitals, but they train twice as many residents per bed as do other teaching hospitals.As a consequence, independent children's teaching hospitals train about 5 percent of all physicians, 25 percent of all pediatricians, and the majority of many pediatric subspecialists who care for children with the most complex conditions, such as children with cancer, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, and more.Recommendations to address the inequity in federal GME support for children's teaching hospitals are supported by the National Association of Children's Hospitals as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs. Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote to President Clinton, to express support for the establishment of interim federal support for the GME program of freestanding, independent children's hospitals. The AAP said, ``(w)e regard the education programs of independent children's hospitals as important to our pediatric workforce and therefore to the future health of all children, because they educate an important proportion of the nation's pediatricians.''Last year, many members of the Senate, including myself, recommended that any comprehensive reform of graduate medical education financing should include commensurate federal GME support for children's teaching hospitals. Instead of enacting GME reform, Congress directed the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission to prepare recommendations for the future of GME financing, including for children's teaching hospitals.Since it will be at least another year before Congress receives those recommendations and potentially several years before Congress is able to act on them, the ``Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act'' will provide interim funding for just four years. It will be commensurate to federal GME support for all teaching hospitals. Specifically, the bill provides, in a capped fund, $100 million in FY 1999 and $285 million in each of the three succeeding fiscal years, for eligible institutions. It will be financed by general revenues, not Medicare HI Trust Funds.I know what a critical role children's hospitals play in the ability of families and communities to care for all children, including children with the most complex conditions and children on families with the most limited economic means. Through their education and research programs, they are also devoted to serving future generations of children, too. Certainly, the children of Missouri as well as Kansas and Southern Illinois, depend vitally on the services and research of independent children's teaching hospitals such as Children's Mercy in Kansas City, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, and the care givers they educate.Children's hospitals are places of daily miracles. Healing that we would never have thought possible a few years ago for children who are burn victims, or trauma victims, or even cancer victims now occurs daily at these hospitals. And while I am sure divine intervention plays a role in this healing, it is also due to the very hard work of skilled doctors, nurses, and dedicated staff that is second to none. We must therefore ensure that these facilities have the resources to continue their noble mission of saving children from the clutches of death and disease.I know trustees, and medical and executive leaders of these institutions. All are committed to controlling the cost of children's health to the best of their ability. But their future ability to sustain their education and research programs will also depend on commensurate federal GME support for them. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the enactment of the ``Children's Hospital Education and Research Act.'',2015-03-16 17:57:38.045186,2015-03-16 17:57:38.045186,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1998-05-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-07/html/CREC-1998-05-07-pt1-PgS4528-4.htm,56,13,144,S4528-S4538,B000611,mr. bond
308,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come back to the floor to talk about Ed-Flex and the importance of that measure for the good education of our kids, and that is what we ought to be talking about.We heard a lot of posturing. Everybody thinks the ideas that come out of Washington are great. Frankly, listening to some of the ideas, I think those are good ideas. If we were a great big United States school board, if we were making the decisions, if we had the responsibility and the authority of making decisions for educating our kids, these might be ideas we would adopt. In any event, they are good ideas to be talking about.There is a real disconnect, and that is what the Ed-Flex measure begins to address. I sincerely hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will let us have a vote on this very, very important bill. We need to move on. There are a lot more things we need to do in education beyond this.I am going to have a very radical proposal to get the Federal Government strings off local education all the way. But I think Ed-Flex is a good bipartisan start, and it builds on a successful example that has been tried in 12 States. It is working. It is working because it gives the flexibility to local school districts to decide how they wish to use the money.The people in the local schools--the school board members, the teachers, the administrators, the parents--know the names of the kids. They know Joe and Sally and Harry and Willie and Thelma and the kids who are being educated in that school district. They know what their challenges are. Some of the good ideas we have in Washington may not work in a particular school district. It may not be the right recipe. Who better to make the decision than the people who know the children, who know their potential, who know their problems?I have found in meetings with educators and parents in every section of this State--in the metropolitan areas, in the urban schools, in the suburban schools, in the rural schools, in the big school districts and the small school districts--that there is one theme that has become a recurring and a growing crescendo. It is: The Federal camel's nose is under the education tent, and it is not doing good things. It is taking time away from the task of educating the kids. When a teacher has to spend hours writing a grant or a principal has to spend time to figure out if they are doing things the way the bureaucrats in Washington want them, he or she is not worrying about what is good for educating Sally or Tommy or Ralph or Cheryl or the kids who are actually getting educated.I am very fortunate, my son is finishing up high school. We watched during his education; we wanted to know what was going on in the classroom, how was he working with his teacher. We as parents knew that. The people who run the local schools know that, but those coming up with great ideas in Washington have no idea of the names of the kids or what their problems are.I thought maybe it would help my colleagues if I shared a few of the stories we are getting from schools in our State. These are smaller schools. It does not matter what the size of the school is, the child who is in that school is just as important whether she or he is in a major metropolitan school district or in a small rural district.Here is a letter from the superintendent of the Bismarck R-V School District. In part it says:. . . In our small school of 700 students, we receive less than $15,000 in the combination of Title II, Title IV and Title VI funds. The restrictions on these funds make them very difficult to deal with for such a small amount of dollars. Some years we consider not using them, simply because the time and effort are not worth the small amount we receive. Removal of some or all of the restrictions would allow us to use the funding to better meet the needs of our school instead of spending the funds in the very restrictive designated areas of Federal funding.Signed, Donald E. Francis, Superintendent, Bismarck R-V Schools.North Mercer District R-3 Public Schools:. . . As the system now works we are overwhelmed by federal and state forms and regulations. We also sacrifice many dollars to support federal and state bureaucracies that compound the forms, rules and regulations. We encountered one program this school year with in excess of 150 pages of instructions. We would like to bring dollar, services and equipment directly to children for their educational benefit.And one more. The Webb City School District R-7:. . . Those of us who have spent a career in education have repeatedly experienced the jubilation of anticipation that arose from promises made by the Federal Government toward education. Unfortunately, however, excitement was then always tempered by the reality of the red tape that accompanied the promise. As the result, frustration was generally the only product forthcoming.Signed, Ronald Lankford, Superintendent of Schools, Webb City School District R-7.Mr. President, that is just a very small sample of the kind of response we are getting from our schools. I challenge any one of you here, any one of our colleagues, to go home and ask the educators who have the job--it is a wonderful opportunity, it is the most important job that we have in this country--of educating our students: Are the 763 different Federal education programs we have right now improving education? I get an overwhelming no. We have to worry about the Washington bureaucracy rather than the needs of the kids in our classrooms.This reality has been recognized. The Nation's Governors--Democrat, Republican, and Independent--50 to 0, said, ``We want to expand Ed-Flex; we want the opportunity in all of the schools in this country to get rid of and cut away some of the bureaucracy and some of the redtape and put that money directly back to education.''There is bipartisan support for this bill. The bill has been supported by the President, by the Secretary of Education, both of whom were former Governors. I am a former Governor. I served with both of them, and we know the importance of education. But the decisions on how we spend the last dollar of Federal aid are not best made here, they are best made at the local school district level.I really hope we can move forward and get this money directly to the schools, giving them the flexibility to use those funds where they are most needed. I urge our colleagues to allow us to do so and pass this bill and go on to the many other important issues involving education that we will be facing later this year.Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.,2015-03-16 17:57:38.189288,2015-03-16 17:57:38.189288,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT,1999-03-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-09/html/CREC-1999-03-09-pt1-PgS2448.htm,37,10,145,S2448-S2453,B000611,mr. bond
309,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume; and I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) for her support for this very, very important bill and thank her for her keen interest in professional military education.I rise today to support H.R. 1490, which would award a masters of science degree to the officers who complete the Joint Advanced Warfighting School at the Joint Forces Staff College. As the gentlewoman from Virginia noted, this bill will give the Department of Defense the authority to award graduates of the Joint Advanced Warfighting School their masters-level degrees. I also urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill.It is important that Congress pass the bill and the President sign it so that we can present those men and women with the accolades that they have earned when the first class of that program graduates this coming Thursday at 9 o'clock in the morning. Madam Speaker, as my colleagues know, I have spent a great deal of my career promoting the need for a rigorous program of joint professional education. We have two missions as I see it: to fight the war that we are fighting today and to prepare for the next. It was the professional military education system that sustained the warfighting competency during the lean years between the First World War and Second World War. Men like General Troy Middleton, who went on to command an Army corps during the Battle of the Bulge, spent years and years in the school system studying the art and science of war. Warfare is becoming more complex at lower and lower levels, and our professional military education system must continue to evolve to develop the thinking warriors the future will require.The Joint Advanced Warfighting School, or JAWS as it is called, at the Joint Forces Staff College is a wonderful example of how joint professional military education has grown to meet the new and unique challenges military professionals face. This first class of JAWS has given its graduates the tools to be able to create campaign-quality concepts, employ all elements of national power, and succeed as joint force operational and strategic level planners as well and commanders. These graduates will populate the Joint Staff and Combatant commands with officers expert in the joint planning processes and capable of critical analysis in the application of all aspects of national power across the full range of military operations.The student of the JAWS program have spent the past year immersed in a rigorous course of study. They have completed a curriculum focused on ``high end'' operational art consisting of courses such as Foundations in Theory of War, Strategic Foundations, and Operational Art and Campaigning, all of which blend theory foundations and historical evidence to provide them with a developmental framework. They have honed their decision-making, problem-solving, and planning skills using seminar exercises, war games, as well as simulations.Additionally, the JAWS course included several field research trips. The students participated in a comprehensive historical staff ride to Gettysburg, for example. They also traveled here to Washington and spent a week with senior military and governmental policymakers as well as practitioners.Madam Speaker, I am sure my colleagues will agree that joint professional military education is so very important. Sir William Francis Butler put it very well when he said, years and years ago, ``The Nation that will insist on drawing a broad line of demarcation between the fighting man and the thinking man is liable to find its fighting done by fools and its thinking done by cowards.''That is why I believe, Madam Speaker, that Congress should vote to support H.R. 1490 so we may recognize the students of the Joint Advanced Warfighting School with a degree they have properly earned.Madam Speaker, having no further speakers, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 17:57:38.354412,2015-03-16 17:57:38.354412,House,AUTHORIZING NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY TO AWARD DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE IN JOINT CAMPAIGN PLANNING AND STRATEGY,2005-06-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-06-07/html/CREC-2005-06-07-pt1-PgH4147-3.htm,74,7,151,H4147-H4148,S000465,mr. skelton
310,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in recognition of the achievements of Dr. Wayne Giles, Chancellor Emeritus of the Metropolitan Community Colleges (MCC) in the Greater Kansas City area. Dr. Giles retired as Chancellor on June 30, 2005 after 22 years of distinguished service to MCC and our community. He served as Vice-Chancellor for Educational Services for the first ten years and the past twelve as Chancellor. He has been a tireless advocate for urban education and has implemented programs that have brought national recognition to the Community College system. For this reason and many more, I rise today to honor and celebrate his achievements.Wayne Giles' tenure with the Metropolitan Community Colleges has been fruitful for the bi-state area, the State of Missouri, and our entire Nation. Dr. Giles has overseen the establishment of two new campuses during his tenure, bringing the total to five community colleges in a system that serves approximately 43,000 students each year. The Longview campus was the first community college in the United States to be recognized as a College of the Year by Time Magazine and the Princeton Review. The Business and Technology College is the first community college in the country to earn ISO 9002 certification, which places it within a select group of companies and organizations worldwide that have achieved this quality standard.Dr. Giles has brought many innovative enhancements to MCC, most recently with the development of writing intensive and diversity courses as part of the general education learning requirements. To best serve MCC's increasingly diverse population, he initiated a faculty internship program, which will be featured at this year's American Association of Community Colleges national conference. This program has significantly increased the number of MCC faculty of color in the last two years.Wayne Giles has served on numerous committees, including: Member of the Presidents Advisory Council, NCATC from 2000 to present--a national network of resources that advocates and promotes the use of technology that enhances economic and workforce development programs and services; Member from 1993 to present, and President in 1994 of RC-2000--a national organization of presidents and chancellors of urban community colleges; Member of the Missouri Training and Employment Council from 2001 to present; Member from 2001 to present of the Coordinating Board for Higher Education Resource Group for Postsecondary Technical Education; and as a Member of the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education Advisory Committee from 1990 to present, serving as Chair in 1998.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Wayne Giles, not only for his unwavering effort to educate youth and adults in the Greater Kansas City area, but also for his courage in bringing about diversity in education and providing a vehicle for workforce training to our citizens. I urge my colleagues to please join me, in congratulating Wayne on his retirement as Chancellor of the Metropolitan Community Colleges, and in celebrating his invaluable contributions and sacrifices to provide educational and employment opportunities to constituents of the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri and throughout our region.,2015-03-16 17:57:38.499514,2015-03-16 17:57:38.499514,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF DR.

311,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise on this rule today to let the American people know of the subterfuge that is going on in these waning days of the Congress.If this rule passes, we will have a bill which amends the budget law to raise the spending limits that now enforce our discretionary budget to reflect the leadership's wanderlust for spending over the past 2 months. This is the day of reckoning for Republicans to wake up and admit the budget resolution they set forth earlier this year was based on a false premise.But in typical fashion, the leadership has decided to determine unilaterally the fiscal priorities of this Congress without a bipartisan agreement on education funding. No money for new teachers, no money for school repairs or expansion, no money for after-school.I ask Members to support the Democratic effort to defeat the previous question so we can appropriately decide the scope of our education investment and then set the new spending levels accordingly.I deeply regret that we have reached this point in the larger budget process. This is no way to run a budget process, a Congress, or a country. This body does not meet. We do not negotiate. We do not discuss. Republican leaders take off 5 days at a time; and as a result, our basic work is undone because we are not here doing our work. The result is one of the biggest budget disasters that anybody can remember.My colleagues on the other side have been so busy throwing money at projects just to get out of town that we have already spent $11.4 billion over the President's request, $11.4 billion over what the President asked for, and they still have not spent a dime to hire a new teacher or build a new school.They have not spent a dime on quality teaching or after-school programs because they have refused to make education the priority of this Congress.We now pass a new CR every day because we are so far into the fiscal year and so far behind in our work. We should be focused on legislation to lift up every public school. This should be the true focus and passion of this Congress.Instead, just yesterday Republican leaders rejected the bipartisan Johnson-Rangel bill supported by 228 Members, Democrats and Republicans, to help districts with school construction, and they came up with their own plan that is a day late and a dollar short. Their plan creates incentives that delay school construction, and half the benefit does not even go to school districts but to bond holders. Private investors. Not children, not principals, not teachers, but bond holders.We are calling on the leadership to pass the bipartisan school construction measure to help modernize our schools. This bill reduces the burden on local taxpayers struggling to finance new construction for their communities. We urge Republican leaders to set aside their opposition and provide enough funding for teachers, emergency school repairs, after-school programs and teacher training, and to put all these measures into the education bill so the President can sign a bill that improves our schools this year.Let us not block progress on education. Let us impose order on this irresponsible budget process. Let us do the work of the American people on education. Stop the delays, stop the foot dragging, stop the electioneering and accomplish something meaningful for our children. We can still salvage something important from this budget process. Let us get it done, and let us get it done this week.,2015-03-16 17:57:38.643617,2015-03-16 17:57:38.643617,House,WAIVING POINTS OF ORDER AGAINST CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4811, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-10-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-25/html/CREC-2000-10-25-pt1-PgH10817-3.htm,135,21,146,H10817-H10841,G000132,mr. gephardt
312,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the Hope and Opportunity Act of 1997 proposed by President Clinton. The bill creates a Hope scholarship tax credit of up to $1,500 per student for tuition and fees in the student's first year, and another $1,500 in the second year if the student earns at least a B average. The credit will help 4.2 million students next year and will save families $18.6 billion over 5 years. The HOPE scholarship is designed to make the first 2 years of college as universal as a high school degree.The act includes a tax deduction up to $10,000--$5,000 maximum in 1997 and 1998--for tuition and fees paid for undergraduate and graduate education, or job training or retraining. The deduction would be ``above the line'' so it is available even if the taxpayer does not itemize. Some 8 million Americans would benefit from this deduction next year, and it will save families $17.5 billion over 5 years.The act increases the maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000, which would be the largest increase in Pell grants in 20 years. Also, some 218,000 older students would become newly eligible for Pell grants by increasing the Pell grant living allowance.I commend President Clinton for including a Pell grant increase in the bill; however, I think it is critical to demonstrate an even greater commitment to helping low-income families obtain educational opportunities. I propose that Pell grants spending be made mandatory for the next 5 years, with a commitment to restore the maximum Pell grant to its full value by 2002 and will introduce my own bill to do that shortly.The President's bill cuts student fees in half for 4 million low- and middle-income students, saving them $2.6 billion over 5 years. It also reduces the in-school interest rate for 2 million students, saving them an additional $1 billion.The bill extends section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code through December 31, 2000, and reinstates the application of that section to graduate students. The provision, scheduled to expire this year, excludes employer paid educational assistance from an employee's gross income and wages. The bill also creates a tax credit for employer provided educational assistance, and provides income exclusion for student loan forgiveness.The act proposes a number of measures that will level the playing field between the Direct Lending and Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL] programs so they can fairly compete and operate efficiently. It recalls $2.5 billion of Federal moneys currently held in reserve by student loan guaranty agencies by clarifying that the Department of Education is the ultimate insurer of all FFEL guarantees. The bill also standardizes repayment plans for the Department of Education loan programs, and increases the percentage lenders and guaranty agencies must bear for student loan defaults.Unlike proposals made by Republicans who want to give tax breaks to the wealthy, the Hope and Opportunity Act of 1997 gives tax relief to middle-class families struggling to pay for college. It is critical to ensure that middle- and low-income students not face insurmountable barriers to higher education. I believe we should move the President's higher education plan to the top of our legislative agenda.,2015-03-16 17:57:38.810730,2015-03-16 17:57:38.810730,Extensions,THE HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1997,1997-04-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-08/html/CREC-1997-04-08-pt1-PgE599-3.htm,40,0,143,E599-E600,C000488,mr. clay
313,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,"Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in 
honoring the work of Dr. Doris Jones Wilson, a music legend and icon in 
the St. Louis, MO community. For over 65 years, she has worked as an 
instructor, arranger and performer of music from every genre. Dr. 
Wilson's retirement marks just one more wonderful milestone in a life 
of service. It is my pleasure and privilege to ask the Senate to pause 
for a moment to honor Dr. Wilson today.Dr. Wilson is a beloved member of the St. Louis community. She first 
earned a bachelor of music education degree from Lincoln University in 
Jefferson City, MO. She continued her education at Washington 
University in Saint Louis earning a master of arts in teaching and 
later a doctor of education in music education. Following her studies, 
Dr. Wilson went on to become a professor of music and director of the 
Concert Chorale of Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis. Dr. 
Wilson recently retired from her position as minister of music for the 
West Side Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis.Dr. Wilson has received numerous awards and commendations over the 
course of her career that recognize the exceptional impact her work as 
a musician, teacher and choral director has had on the music community. 
I was so humbled to learn that this previous September, the Kennedy 
Center featured a special performance of one of her most popular 
arrangements, ``Even Me.'' This is only one in a long list of honors.In 2004, Hampton University awarded her the Living Legend Award of 
Ministers and Choir Directors. She received the Missouri Arts Award 
from the Missouri Arts Council in 1998 and the Excellence in Teaching 
Award from Emerson Electric in 1997. In 1994, Dr. Wilson was honored 
with the Stellar Performer Award from the St. Louis American newspaper 
for outstanding leadership in music education. That same year the 
Bahamas Department of Tourism wrote Dr. Wilson a letter of commendation 
for Concert Choral Performance. In 1981, Dr. Wilson was awarded the 
Gold Medal for Concert Choral at the International Music Festival.As a Representative of the great State of Missouri and a resident of 
St. Louis, I am proud and humbled by the life and career of Dr. Wilson. 
I have no doubt that she has touched the lives of many students with 
her wonderful gift and spirit. The education and wisdom that she has 
passed on as a music educator will live on in the work her students do 
and the people they become. I truly believe that the impact her work 
has had on the St. Louis community is immeasurable.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and 
honoring Dr. Doris Jones Wilson on her retirement. ",2015-03-16 17:57:38.965843,2015-03-16 17:57:38.965843,Senate,TRIBUTE TO DR. DORIS JONES WILSON,2011-11-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-11-01/html/CREC-2011-11-01-pt1-PgS7003.htm,165,0,157,S7003,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
314,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Madam President, on Thursday morning, the Senate took cloture votes in relation to motions to proceed to S. 953 and S. 1003, which represent a Democratic and Republican proposal, respectively, to address the interest rate offered on subsidized Federal Stafford loans, a form of Federal student loan available to many who are pursuing a postsecondary education. I was unable to be present for these votes, due to a prescheduled commitment; before the timing of these votes was envisioned, my attendance was confirmed at a women's conference. Because my presence would not have changed the outcome of either vote, I honored my previous commitment. Had I been present I would have voted in support of S. 953 and opposed S. 1003.In my State, over 150,000 students will borrow subsidized Stafford loans next school year. These are need-based loans given to kids who have studied hard and families who have made financial sacrifices and plan to borrow what they need to cover the rising costs of higher education. Rather than reward their efforts, the government plans to add to their burden unless action is taken. On July 1, the interest rate on new subsidized Stafford student loans is scheduled to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent.We are facing a crisis. Already, officials at the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have all warned that student borrowing threatens to dampen consumption, depress the economy, limit credit creation, and pose a threat to our Nation's financial stability. Students and graduates in my State are already heavily in student loan debt. Two out of every three Missouri students will leave college with student loan debt. If we fail to take action, students with subsidized Stafford loans will have to pay over $1,000 more than they would under current interest rates on their loans. At a time when a higher education is vital to expanded opportunity for so many young people and with a 21st century economy that increasingly demands workers with the skills learned as part of a college education, we cannot be making it even more difficult for young people to financially achieve a college education. We need to act.There are several proposals to address this impending crisis. I am a proud cosponsor of two bills that would provide needed relief and give Congress the opportunity to address a long-term solution to exploding student loan debt when it reauthorizes the Higher Education Act.The first, S. 953, the Student Loan Affordability Act, introduced by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, would lock in the current 3.4% rate for subsidized Stafford loans for 2 years while Congress works on a long-term solution to slow the rapid accumulation of student loan debt. This bill would be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes enjoyed by companies that move American jobs offshore, big oil companies, and the wealthiest Americans.I am also a cosponsor of Senator Warren's Bank on Students Loan Fairness Act which would give students the same deal we give to the big banks by allowing those who are eligible for subsidized Stafford loans to borrow at the same rate offered to banks through the Federal Reserve discount window. This is commonsense, and it is fair.Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe the solution to this current uncertainty is even more uncertainty. Their solution, S. 1003, would produce variable, uncapped interest rates that would hit low-income students the hardest.Today's votes leave us in the same situation we were in: we need to act to prevent student loan interest rate increases that would additionally burden our students. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve meaningful legislation that preserves the availability of student loans and the economic opportunities they afford as an option for future generations of Americans. ,2015-03-16 17:57:39.117976,2015-03-16 17:57:39.117976,Senate,VOTE EXPLANATION,2013-06-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-06-07/html/CREC-2013-06-07-pt1-PgS4019-3.htm,80,0,159,S4019-S4020,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
315,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate will take votes in relation to the Manchin amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1911, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act. I was unable to be present for this vote, due to a pre-scheduled commitment in my home State for which my attendance was confirmed before the timing of these votes was set. Because my presence would not have changed the outcome of either vote, I honored my previous commitment. Had I been present I would have voted in support of Senator Manchin's amendment.We are facing a crisis. On July 1, interest rates on new subsidized Stafford student loans doubled, from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. Already, officials at the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have all warned that student borrowing threatens to dampen consumption, depress the economy, limit credit creation, and pose a threat to our Nation's financial stability. Students and graduates in my State are already heavily in student loan debt. Two out of every three Missouri students will leave college with student loan debt. At a time when a higher education is vital to expanded opportunity for so many young people and with a 21st Century economy that increasingly demands workers with the skills earned as part of a college education, we cannot make it even more difficult for young people to financially achieve a college education. We need to act.While not perfect, the Manchin amendment is the product of bipartisan compromise, forged and supported by Members from both sides of the aisle. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation because it will provide relief to our Nation's students by lowering interest rates for America's student loan borrowers. This relief will not only apply to subsidized Stafford loans; it will apply to loans to undergraduates, graduate students, and the parents of students seeking to pay for their education. Importantly, this legislation also includes interest rate caps; without this feature, I would not have been able to support this bill.I would have also supported the second-degree amendment put forth by Senators Reed and Warren because it is consistent with my commitment to keeping rates low. The Reed-Warren amendment would provide certainty to students and families by ensuring that interest rates will go no higher than they would under the fixed rates in current law without adding to our deficit. I believe this is a responsible measure that deserves bipartisan support.To be clear, addressing the issue of student loan interest rates is only one piece of the puzzle of ensuring that higher education is affordable and attainable to those who seek it. We must also examine the issues of the rising costs of college attendance and the rapid growth of the proprietary college sector, where the share of Federal student aid payments and loan defaults is disproportionately and alarmingly high.I will continue to work with my colleagues on all of these issues. Congress has an important role in helping American students attain the higher education opportunities they seek, to ensure that our Nation remain a global leader in the 21st century economy. ,2015-03-16 17:57:39.240035,2015-03-16 17:57:39.240035,Senate,SMARTER SOLUTIONS FOR STUDENTS ACT,2013-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-07-24/html/CREC-2013-07-24-pt1-PgS5863.htm,107,81,159,S5863-S5894,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
316,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize St. Vincent Catholic High School in Perryville, MO, which was recently named to the list of the best 50 Catholic secondary schools in America. The list is compiled by the Catholic High School Honor Roll, an independent project of the Grand Rapids, Michigan-based Acton Institute, a research and education organization. Around one-half of all U.S. Catholic high schools go through the application process for the Honor Roll list, a group of approximately 1,300 schools. These schools are recognized based on their academic excellence, civic education and Catholic identity. Schools provide extensive data on standardized testing and other academic measures, and administrators answer surveys on academics, Catholic teaching and social studies.St. Vincent High School is a part of the history of Perryville. The parish was first established in the 19th century. The Daughters of Charity began the school in 1907. Over more than a century the school has maintained its commitment to educating their students in a faith based way that helps them spiritually and to prepare for the future. The students, faculty, and families involved in St. Vincent High School provide a wonderful example to schools all across Southeast Missouri and the nation. This recognition encourages their hard work and continued excellence in Catholic education.This is an outstanding achievement in which the St. Vincent High School and all of the surrounding community should take pride. One of the best Catholic schools in the nation is St. Vincent High School. Congratulations again to the St. Vincent High School community. We are all very proud of you!,2015-03-16 17:57:39.385138,2015-03-16 17:57:39.385138,Extensions,HONORING ST.

317,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Missourians, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mill Creek Elementary School in Columbia, MO.Mill Creek Elementary is celebrating 20 years of dedication to educating its students. When Mill Creek opened in 1989, it served 486 students. Now, the school is home to 90 faculty and staff members and 760 students.Mill Creek Elementary has educated and advanced thousands of students over the years. The faculty and staff have helped students to develop the knowledge and skills that will serve them throughout their lives so they may contribute to their communities one day.At Mill Creek, students pledge to be respectful of themselves and others, responsible for their own learning and behavior, and resourceful problem-solvers. These standards are known as the 3 R's: respect, responsibility, and resourcefulness. Mill Creek hopes to instill these standards within its students so they will use them not just at school but also in their homes and their communities.Public education is strengthened when schools have the support of the local community. KMIZ-17, Rolling Hills Veterinary, Columbia Insurance Group and Boulevard Bank have all stepped forward to be involved at Mill Creek through the Partners in Education program. These businesses provide time and support to students through mentoring, hands-on lessons and even a school weather station.Strong parental involvement also leads to school success. Mill Creek benefits tremendously from the countless PTA and volunteer hours donated by family members and community leaders each year.Mill Creek Elementary has been committed for over 20 years to providing a high quality education to its students and preparing them to be leaders in their community. Parents, students, teachers and staff can all be proud of their accomplishments.Congratulations to the Cougars! ,2015-03-16 17:57:39.573278,2015-03-16 17:57:39.573278,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2009-12-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-12-03/html/CREC-2009-12-03-pt1-PgS12319-2.htm,178,0,155,S12319,B000611,mr. bond

320,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and exceptionally distinguished career in the field of education will soon come to an end. Dr. Bobby Patton will be retiring from his position as President of Central Missouri State University on June 30 after six years of service to the University.Dr. Patton received a BA in Speech, Theatre, and English at Texas Christian University, a Masters in Speech and Drama at the University of Kansas, and a Doctorate in Speech Communication at the University of Kansas.Dr. Patton has had an exceptional career in education for many years. In 1967, Dr. Patton began his educational career at the University of Kansas as the Associate Chair and Acting Chair of the Department of Speech and Drama. In 1972, Dr. Patton continued his career at the University of Kansas as the Chair of the Department of Speech and Drama. In 1980, Dr. Patton was Chair of the Division of Communication and Theatre at the University of Kansas.

321,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge Members to vote for the Slaughter-Dicks, amendment which will be offered later today.The arts are an integral part of our Nation's heritage and the arts represent the treasures of our Nation. They help children learn. Through arts education, millions of our children enter a world where they discover music, drama, dance, as well as the visual arts.And the arts are not only important for cultural enrichment in the education of our children. From coast to coast, the arts are economic engines in our Nation's communities. The arts contribute $134 billion a year to our economy, according to a recent study. And in my hometown of St. Louis, the arts contribute almost $500 million to the local economy and are a source of employment for thousands of people.If this amendment passes, funding for the arts and humanities would be increased by just $15 million. That is a modest increase, but the benefits are huge. I think it is time, once and for all, to end the assault on funding the arts that we have seen over the past years.I hope today we can cast a bipartisan decisive vote. I hope we will send a strong signal. I hope we will demonstrate that the Congress is committed to enriching our culture and strengthening our education in our economy.Jack Kennedy said in 1962 that one of the ``fascinating challenges of these days'' is ``to further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all the processes and fulfillment of art.''Vote ``yes'' on this important amendment.

The university's commitment to excellence has been recognized nationally, and with its mission as Missouri's liberal arts and sciences university, it is only fitting that its name honor the State's most famous native son, Harry S Truman.Like President Truman, the university had humble beginnings when it was founded by Joseph Baldwin in 1867, as Missouri's first Normal School. In 1870, the Normal School graduating class numbered 15 students. In 1996, approximately 1,200 students will graudate from Northeast Missouri State University. Since its founding the university has educated more than 45,000 graduates who can be found in every State and throughout the world pursuing careers in education, sciences, public service, business, law, and the arts.In addition to this explosive growth the university has expanded into new fields of study sicne those first graduates. In recognition of the university's strong emphasis on the liberal arts and sciences, it was designated Missouri's official liberal arts and sciences university by the Missouri State Legislature in 1986. Northeast has also distinguished itself as a leader in student achievement and has been repeatedly recognized as a national leader in excellent, cost-effective, education.On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University will officially become Truman State University. It is with this change in mind that I offer my warmest congratulations on more than a century of outstanding education and the hope that Truman State will enjoy continued success as Missouri's liberal arts and science university.,2015-03-16 17:57:40.295814,2015-03-16 17:57:40.295814,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO NORTHEAST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY,1996-06-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-06-25/html/CREC-1996-06-25-pt1-PgE1159.htm,95,0,142,E1159,V000112,mr. volkmer
323,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Catholic Schools Week 2010.From January 31 to February 6, 2010, nearly 2.2 million students who attend the nation's 7,248 elementary, middle and secondary Catholic schools will celebrate Catholic Schools Week.More than 48,000 students attend Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of St. Louis, which includes 10 counties and the City of St. Louis. Over 21,000 additional Catholic students are served through 122 parish schools of religion.I applaud the efforts of faculty and parents who provide our nation's children with an excellent education focused on faith and values.The 2010 theme, ``Catholic Schools--Dividends for Life: Faith, Knowledge, Discipline, Morals'' reminds parents of the dividends that a Catholic school education offers. Students are prepared in faith, knowledge, morals and discipline which last a lifetime. There is no better way to invest in a child's future--and the future of our nation.Recently, 10 Catholic schools in my congressional district joined together and raised more than $200,000 for the Key Player Initiative, which provides permanent, supportive housing to the homeless in the St. Louis region. Dan Buck, the head of St. Patrick Center, which provides services for the homeless and indigent in the St. Louis area, said the efforts of these students amazed and humbled him. He went on to say ``We learn to never underestimate the power of children and the support of our community.'' At the same event, George Henry, the superintendent of Catholic education for the Archdiocese of St. Louis said, ``our students put into practice what they are taught about treating others as Jesus would. Through the Key Player Initiative, they learned that the homeless and poor are right here in St. Louis and did their part to make this city a better place for all of us to live.'' This initiative is just one of many examples of the efforts catholic schools in my district have become involved in, and there are similar stories from many other districts throughout the country.Catholic Schools Week is a testament to the outstanding work by the Archdioceses across the country.The Archdiocese of St. Louis has a longstanding tradition of leadership. I thank the Archdiocese for their commitment to enriching the lives of children by providing an education based on family, values, and faith.For that reason, I rise today in support of H.

324,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring the work of Reverend Sam Mann, a leader in the Kansas City community. Reverend Mann's retirement is yet one more wonderful milestone in a life of service.Sam was raised in Eufala, AL, and made Kansas City his home as a young man. Over the years, he has been a tireless civil rights advocate in Kansas City and the Nation. He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and participated in numerous activities to raise awareness of race and justice issues.Since 1971, Sam has been the pastor of St. Mark's United Methodist Church in downtown Kansas City. He has been the executive director of United Inner City Services, a multiservice community-based agency, since 1967.I have always known Reverend Mann as ``rubber band.'' This derives from the time I was walking with him through a roomful of young children who were attending a program he had designed that predated his establishment of the St. Mark center. From the beginning, Sam was always looking out for children. As we were walking through the room, the children were pulling on his coattail saying, ``Reverend Mann, Reverend Mann'' but it sounded like ``rubber band, rubber band.'' From that day forward, he has always been ``rubber band'' to me.Sam believes in the importance of education and has been a strong advocate for early childhood education. Under his leadership, St. Mark Child and Family Development Center was established. This center started in a church basement and now is located in a beautiful state-of-the-art facility. In addition, the center serves as a neighborhood anchor, providing a safe, warm and attractive site for a variety of community services. St. Mark annually serves approximately 225 very low and low-income families through its early childhood education program, before- and after-school program and summer camp. These children and their families have been forever impacted by Sam's work and dedication.Sam was the founder of the Presbyterian Urban Ministers Network, was a cosponsor of Kansas City's Urban Peace & Justice Summit, and served on the Board of the Black Archives of Mid-America. For 25 years, he has served as chair of Kansas City's local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.While we hope that retirement affords Sam some much deserved relaxation and time on the golf course, we also look forward to his continued involvement in education projects and social justice issues important to the lives of Kansas Citians.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Reverend Sam Mann on his retirement. ,2015-03-16 17:57:40.576992,2015-03-16 17:57:40.576992,Senate,TRIBUTE TO REVEREND SAM MANN,2010-09-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-20/html/CREC-2010-09-20-pt1-PgS7203-2.htm,126,0,156,S7203,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

The Missouri Teacher of the Year is a prestigious honors program that focuses public attention on excellence in teaching. Williams, a 37 year educator has earned the respect and admiration of students, parents, and colleagues alike. She inspires students of all backgrounds and abilities to learn. For the aforementioned reasons, I enthusiastically honor Mrs. Williams today before Congress.Louis, Missouri. She was inspired by her psychology teacher Mr. Brown to pursue a career in education. Mrs. Williams went on to graduate from the University of Missouri--St. Louis.Mrs. Williams is the social studies department chair for University City High School in University City, Missouri where she has been teaching for the last 18 years. Williams who also teaches history, government, and an African-American experience course was one of six finalists to compete in this year's competition.The Missouri Teacher of the Year program is conducted annually by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, in conjunction with the National Teacher of the Year program. Major funding for Missouri's program is provided by The Boeing Company, St. Louis, Missouri.Before joining University City, Williams began her illustrious career in education as principal and administrator from 1986 to 1990 at West Side Christian Academy in St. Louis.

329,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Mr. Speaker, I think that the whole energy issue is quite convoluted because we are never able to address the issues that we want the American public to benefit from because there are always little tricks.For example, LIHEAP was placed in the energy bill last year, which is money for low-income individuals to get assistance in their heating costs, and so that is placed in there. So that, if you vote against it, it means that you are against poor people, and of course I voted against it because at some point I came to the conclusion that I had to be faithful to who I am. I am not voting for any of those things anymore, where they do what we call the ``got you'' legislation, and I am not voting for that anymore because the American public ends up suffering every time we do that.But the question that I think is going to be raised here is will Congress make the decision to allow legislation to surface that would require that they give up gas guzzlers when they use government money to do the lease. Now, this is not private vehicles, but what the public may not know is many Members of Congress legitimately will lease automobiles. They can only lease them for 2 years because we are only here for 2 years, and then we must go up for reelection. So we are saying that when the lease expires, if you really believe in energy efficiency, then let us make sure that the public can see us as ones who are embracing what we are preaching. It is a horrible, horrible thing to advocate in a commercial that people should drink Coca-Cola and then people visit your home and you have Pepsi.So I think one of the things Congress must do, it is a moral thing I believe to stand up and say we are going to drive energy efficient cars. It gives us the right then to begin to talk to the public about some legitimate sacrifices that all of us are going to have to make.Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about energy supplies and the cost of a tank of gas and how difficult it has been for Americans to deal with those increases, and another equally important issue is how people are going to continue to be able to educate their children from their youngest age all the way through higher education.One of the things I think it is important for us to highlight tonight is the devastating budget cuts that this Republican budget puts forward in terms of the public education needs that we have.Literally, the Republican House budget resolution would make the biggest cut, and I think I am right, correct me if I am wrong, the biggest cuts to the Department of Education in 23 years. I guess the only thing that would be worse would be when they proposed to completely eliminate the Department of Education, but they are not doing that. They simply have the biggest cut in 23 years.The budget resolution cuts next year's Department of Education budget by $2.2 billion, with a B, below this year's funding level. It matches the President's budget cuts in his budget proposal dollar for dollar. Rather than increase education funding, both of the budgets, the Republican leadership's budget and the President's, grossly underfund education, social services and training programs. They cut those programs $4.6 billion below the amount needed to maintain current services. They eliminate completely 42 different education programs, not ones that people would think are not necessary anymore, but things like vocational education, safe and drug free school State grants, a college readiness program for low income students and both parts of the Federal Perkins loan program. It is just really unbelievable. You talked about priorities. This is where the Republicans priorities are compared to where we are as Democrats.,2015-03-16 17:57:41.426618,2015-03-16 17:57:41.426618,House,THE CONTINUED MISDIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY,2006-05-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-05-10/html/CREC-2006-05-10-pt1-PgH2488-2.htm,56,22,152,H2488-H2495,C001061,mr. cleaver
330,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Mr. James Lee Rackers of Jefferson City, MO.Mr. Rackers was born in Jefferson City, on December 27, 1933, son of Lee and Helen Heislen Rackers. He attended Central Missouri State University and graduated from Lincoln University in 1956, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Secondary School Education. He earned his masters in Secondary School Administration from the University of Missouri-Columbia. He was united in marriage to Nancy Brettschneider on November 24, 1955. They were blessed with four wonderful children, three sons and one daughter.Mr. Rackers began his career teaching at Helias High School in the fall of 1956. He was the head basketball and track coach and assistant football coach. He was the Athletic Director from 1966 until 1967, when he became Assistant Principal. In 1971 Jim became the first lay principal at a Catholic secondary school in Missouri. Jim was principal until 1992, when he became Helias' first Chief Administrator. In 1997 he became the first Director of Development for Helias High School and Executive Director of the Helias Foundations. On May 1, 1998, the newly constructed Field House was named the James L. Rackers Field House in honor of his years of dedication and loyalty to Helias High School.Along with his successful career, Mr. Rackers was an active member of St. Peter Catholic Church and was also a member of numerous professional and community organizations. Mr. Rackers was a member in the National Association of Secondary School Principals, Missouri Association of Secondary School Principals, North Central Association, National Catholic Education Association, Committee on Accredited Schools Non-Public, and the Missouri Council for American Private Education. He received numerous awards; including the 1991 Communicator of the Year Award from the Public Relations Society of America, 1997 Immaculate Conception Outstanding Alumni Award, 1997 Certificate of Appreciation for outstanding services to students in Support of Vocational Education at Nichols Career Center, and 25 year Silver Service Award of the Missouri Association of Secondary School Principals.Mr. Speaker, James Lee Rackers was a valuable leader in all aspects of his life. He was a genuine human being who would do anything for anyone. I know the Members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to his family: his wife, Nancy; his three sons, Dennis, John, and Timothy; his daughter Maureen; and all of his grandchildren.,2015-03-16 17:57:41.573693,2015-03-16 17:57:41.573693,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF JAMES LEE RACKERS,2006-06-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-06-21/html/CREC-2006-06-21-pt1-PgE1233-3.htm,81,0,152,E1233-E1234,S000465,mr. skelton
331,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, on May 20th, East Central College in Union, Missouri will watch with pride as young men and women receive their diploma and enter the working world. Commencement is a joyous time filled with celebrations and happiness, but also sadness and trepidation as students begin their adult lives and careers in new cities, often leaving friends behind.East Central College's upcoming graduation will be no different. There will, however, be one major difference from previous graduations--it will mark the last time that Dr. Karen Herzog presides over her students in her official capacity as the college's President.As such, I rise today to honor Dr. Karen Herzog for her distinguished academic career and commitment to higher education. Dr. Herzog grew up in Carthage, Missouri and studied at Ozark Christian College in nearby Joplin where she earned a B.A. in literature. She subsequently earned a master's degree in American literature from Kansas State University and later a Ph.D. in higher education policy from the University of Kansas.Dr. Herzog started her academic career at the Metropolitan Community College District system located in the greater Kansas City area where she taught English. After fifteen years, Dr. Herzog moved into an administrative role at the college. She rose through the ranks and eventually assumed the position of Associate Vice Chancellor of Education. In 1999, East Central College offered Dr. Herzog the Presidency, which she accepted.For the past six years, Dr. Herzog has made an indelible mark on the students of East Central College and residents of Franklin County. She has chaired the Franklin County Economic Development Council and been a member of the Franklin County Family and Children Mental Health Board, the Washington 353 Redevelopment Corporation and the Union Rotary Club. While at East Central, Dr. Herzog established a centralized Learning Center for students, earned full ten-year accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and attained record enrollment levels. Dr. Herzog has clearly had a positive impact on the community, on East Central College, and most importantly, on the students that have received a quality education as a result of her efforts.It has been a pleasure working with Dr. Herzog and I wish her continued success in her future endeavors. Her dedication to Missouri's students is exemplary and deserving of commendation. For these reasons, it is my pleasure to rise and share her accomplishments with my colleagues.,2015-03-16 17:57:41.711791,2015-03-16 17:57:41.711791,Extensions,IN HONOR OF DR.

They are saying we have to really start to win the battle of young minds to get them into science and math education so that we can compete and innovate in this new global economy. This just takes us backwards.The statistics are alarming.

334,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise against the Republican budget because it cuts women's education acts and programs.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Democratic budget substitute and in opposition to the Republican plan which fails to address the needs and fiscal challenges America faces today. Instead of creating jobs, it creates record deficits. It shortchanges education, healthcare, veterans and does little to aid the sagging economy. Further, it makes drastic cuts to programs that provide educational and business opportunities to women across the country.This budget eliminates Women's Educational Equity Act Programs, which fund activities promoting educational equity for girls and women. Over 10 percent of young women drop out of high school, yet the President's budget eliminates funding for dropout prevention programs. As a former teacher, I understand the importance of education in providing young men and women with the background they need to lead successful lives. This budget cuts many vital programs such as Head Start and Even Start and freezes funding for Pell Grants.More than 3.8 million women are looking for work, yet the Administration cuts $79 million in funding for the Small Business Administration, which helps women and minority owned small businesses grow. There are more than 7 million small businesses owned by women. The need for SBA assistance continues to be vital to my community.This budget freezes funding for The Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which provides child care assistance for low income families and early education services to disadvantaged children and is essential to working women nationwide.Further, violence against women prevention programs and SBA Women's Business Centers are underfunded, and no increase is requested by the Administration for the National Women's Business Council, which conducts invaluable research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations.Mr. Chairman, this budget fails to meet the fiscal challenges America faces today and slashes programs that are the lifeline to working families, especially women heads of households. I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic substitute as a much more realistic budgetary solution that restores funding to vital programs and achieves balance in the budget and assistance to those who seek the American dream.,2015-03-16 17:57:42.166114,2015-03-16 17:57:42.166114,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005,2004-03-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-24/html/CREC-2004-03-24-pt1-PgH1443-3.htm,38,15,150,H1443-H1451,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

337,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, it is back-to-school time. Indeed, as I look at the clock above the Speaker's chair, in about 2 hours when we call for votes, this Chamber will fill with our colleagues; and there will be some of the same giddiness as kids going back to school. And the inevitable question we ask one another is what did you do on your summer break?Certainly I think as we prepare for some very solemn events later this week as well as next week and certainly recognizing the impact of a year ago, I think a lot of attention has caused us to really forget some of the important education initiatives that have passed and become law. Specifically, this Congress began last year with a renewed commitment to education. ``Leave no child behind'' has become a familiar mantra. In fact that landmark legislation of leaving no child behind is now the law of the land and really starts with the mindset that a child, any child, can learn.As President Bush stated, indeed as Governor of the State of Texas, ``The Federal Government must be humble enough to stay out of the day-to-day operation of local schools, wise enough to give State and local school districts more authority and freedom, and strong enough to require results. We must make our schools worthy of all of our children. Whatever their background, their cause is our cause. It must not be lost.''Thereupon we came together in a very bipartisan way and passed that landmark legislation. But Congress did not stop there. Last summer in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, there were some significant tax incentives to improve the affordability of education, not just higher education but kindergarten through elementary school, through secondary, essentially schoolchildren of all ages that would be able to take advantage of through their parents or other mentors or family members, opportunities of savings vehicles and incentives through the Tax Code.Yet, Mr. Speaker, as you know and as this body knows, a year ago when we enacted the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, because of some very technical, arcane procedural rules in the other body, there was a sunset provision placed upon those tax incentives relating to education. What this bill today, H.R. 5203, attempts to do is to make permanent those positive savings vehicles, those tax incentives that would help all parents across the country really focus on their children's education.Certainly, as we debated this a year ago, the idea is a simple one. No child should be discriminated against because of the choice of where he or she goes to school. Public schools, private schools, religious schools, home schools, any child should have the advantage of these tax incentives through parents or other mentors as far as educational expenses.We cannot in Congress, of course, set tuition rates. We cannot set student fees. In my hometown of Columbia, Missouri, as college students are coming back, they are lamenting the fact that they are facing an 8 percent tuition hike this year. There is nothing that not only this legislative body but other State legislatures can do as far as the rising cost of tuition. However, we have acted as far as making college education and other educational expenses more affordable, education more accessible. It is time to make those provisions in the Tax Code permanent, those tax relief measures. This body has acted making the entire Economic Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001 permanent. We have also acted as a body to make those pension opportunities permanent, the marriage penalty repeal permanent as well as the death tax repeal. We believe it is time for Congress to make a renewed commitment to make permanent the education tax incentives. Accordingly, I ask that H.R. 5203 be adopted.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 17:57:42.624440,2015-03-16 17:57:42.624440,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE PERMANENCE ACT OF 2002,2002-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-04/html/CREC-2002-09-04-pt1-PgH6022.htm,110,3,148,H6022-H6028,H000948,mr. hulshof
338,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise briefly to welcome and congratulate my colleague, Senator Carnahan, the newly elected Senator from Missouri, on her first remarks on the floor. I apologize for not being able to be here when she made the comments. I was in a Health Committee meeting asking questions about Missouri education programs of the Secretary of Education.I understand Senator Carnahan was talking about education on the floor, and I know education and children's issues are going to be areas where we will work together. Yesterday, Senator Carnahan joined as a cosponsor on a couple measures that are very important, ensuring 100-percent deductibility on health insurance for the self-employed, which is very important to farmers and small business people in my State, and also providing relief from the draconian cuts enforced by HCFA on home health care agencies, which cost us half the home health care agencies in Missouri.We have many areas in which we are looking forward to working together. I tell my colleagues that Senator Carnahan has been a long-time friend. She and her family were close associates in Jefferson City. Senator Carnahan was best known in Missouri as a very strong helpmate of our late Governor, treasurer, and servant, Mel Carnahan. I got to know her very well when they shared the same public housing in which we had lived, the Governor's mansion in Missouri. She was a very strong champion of the preservation of that mansion and a most gracious hostess for all the people of Missouri who came there.After the terrible tragedy which befell her family in our State last year, she was strong and gracious and was widely respected and admired by all Missourians. I know colleagues on this side of the aisle who have not had an opportunity to get to know her and work with her will look forward to doing so. I congratulate her and wish her well after making her first speech on the Senate floor. I know there will be many other issues which affect our mutual constituents on which we will be working together.I thank the Chair and my colleagues for indulging me as I extend a very warm welcome to Senator Carnahan.,2015-03-16 17:57:42.755535,2015-03-16 17:57:42.755535,Senate,SENATOR CARNAHAN'S MAIDEN SPEECH,2001-02-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-02-15/html/CREC-2001-02-15-pt1-PgS1442.htm,22,0,147,S1442,B000611,mr. bond
339,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Continuing Resolution, the fourth resolution in as many weeks to keep the government open. I call on Republicans to stop the delays, stop the obfuscation, and keep Congress in session so we can finish our work. We must do the people's agenda, and we must do it now.We are now three weeks beyond the start of the fiscal year, and the light at the end of the tunnel is still not shining brightly. We do not meet. We take off days at a time. We spend our time on the floor naming courthouses, voting on suspension bills.And the American people are not seeing any results.Education is America's number one priority. But this Congress has failed to meet the challenge. Republicans have refused to dedicate funding to reduce class size and for school construction. They are unwilling to fund critical priorities so communities can hire more teachers, improve teacher quality, and provide more after-school programs. Instead, they support block grants with no accountability that a single teacher will be hired or a single classroom fixed. They also let the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expire for the first time in 35 years because of their extremism.The time has come to stop the delays, stop the foot-dragging, and act on the education priorities of the American people. We should not neglect the people's agenda for personal politics. This Congress should stay in session and finish our spending work. We should take a first step to make every public school a great public school.Democrats want funding dedicated to emergency school repairs; the bipartisan Johnson-Rangel tax credit to help schools districts on school construction bonds; funding to hire 100,000 highly-qualified teachers to reduce class size, and for teacher training and recruitment and after-school programs that are an essential part of any school reform.We are in an Information Age. Every child needs to know how to read and write. Parents are working more and they are commuting more, and they have less time for children. And our public schools are not equipped to fill the breach. What we are asking for is a sensible, first step toward filling the holes in our education system. And I believe there is still time to work together, in a bipartisan way, to meet this challenge.Let's stop neglecting our work, stop passing these stopgap measures, and do what any sensible legislative body would do: finish our spending bills, fund the priorities of our people, and get away from the special interests.,2015-03-16 17:57:42.898663,2015-03-16 17:57:42.898663,House,FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgH10402-3.htm,132,37,146,H10402-H10411,G000132,mr. gephardt
340,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed that we find ourselves debating this bill today. With all the problems facing our schools, overcrowded classrooms, crumbling buildings, teacher shortages, it boggles the mind to see that the first bill passed out of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities this year is one as petty as this one.It is designed as a political ploy to embarrass Secretary of Education Riley and President Clinton. There is no reason to act on this bill today. The fiscal year 1998 Labor HHS Education Appropriations bill is very clear. It prohibits the use of 1998 fiscal year funds to field test, administer, distribute or implement any national test. The appropriations bill also requires three separate studies by the National Academy of Sciences, which are due later this year.This proposal fails to address a number of issues of critical concern to parents, students, teachers and schools. And I ask some questions, some very basic questions that this Congress ought to be asking, that our Chairman referred to in his opening remark:Will a national test accommodate students who have limited English proficiency or disabilities? Could the test be used for high stakes purposes such as tracking, funding reductions, grade retention and graduation thresholds? How will civil rights protections be ensured in the development, use, and administration of the test? How do we weed out bias and discrimination in the content of a national test? And most importantly, will those students who fail the test be provided significant new resources to ensure that they will have real educational opportunities?These are legitimate concerns and legitimate questions that this Congress ought to answer. But if this bill passes, the sponsor of this bill will preclude the Congress from ever acting in these areas.Mr. Chairman, we should act to resolve these and other serious questions about national testing in a measured, deliberate way during this year's reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress, and the National Assessment of Governing Boards.Mr. Chairman, with so few days in this legislative session, it is critical that the House act wisely and constructively on urgent education priorities. We should be passing legislation to repair our Nation's crumbling schools and overcrowded schools. We should be initiating legislation calling for reduced class sizes and stronger after-school programs. This bill does nothing to address these critical needs. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I urge its defeat.,2015-03-16 17:57:43.032737,2015-03-16 17:57:43.032737,House,PROHIBITION ON FEDERALLY SPONSORED NATIONAL TESTING,1998-02-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-05/html/CREC-1998-02-05-pt1-PgH339-2.htm,7,42,144,H339-H355,C000488,mr. clay

In fact, when you walk into the school, the doormat there says ``Don't do drugs.''This constant educational process that helps young people realize that with every choice there comes a responsibility, it sounds like this is also working in your home district.,2015-03-16 17:57:43.187869,2015-03-16 17:57:43.187869,House,OUR RIGHT TO SAFETY AND FREEDOM FROM FEAR,1997-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-23/html/CREC-1997-04-23-pt1-PgH1781.htm,49,5,143,H1781-H1786,H000948,mr. hulshof
342,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, thanking Mr. Dean, Members of the House, I rise this morning on behalf of all of my Democratic colleagues and all of my colleagues to welcome the newest Member of the House of Representatives, Juanita Millender-McDonald of California.Many of our colleagues have begun their careers in local and State, city, town government and built their understanding of their districts and their communities from the bottom up, from the grass roots. But in the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Millender-McDonald], we have gained a colleague who has already used her talents as a State lawmaker to become a national leader.A former school teacher, Ms. Millender-McDonald has been an innovator on education policy, pushing for creative reforms in California's inner-city schools, such as better English instruction, tougher standards and model school-to-work programs. That may be why she was appointed to the National Commission on Teaching in America's Future and the Education Committee of the States, where she serves as a powerful voice for California.She has also worked to start workshops all across the country to encourage broad education reform.But education is just one of the issues on which she has made her mark. From her seat in one of California's most diverse assembly districts, she fought for transportation improvements that are creating hundreds of new jobs, for child care, for grandparents raising their grandchildren, for the growth of high-tech business in California, for basic rights for the homeless, and for reform of California's workmen's compensation laws.When she became chair of California assembly's insurance committee, she was the first woman and the first minority to do so.When she became chair of the revenue and taxation committee, she was also the first woman to do that. She has blazed a trail of innovation and accomplishment on every issue that she has faced.My colleagues, not only have we gained a tireless and effective new champion for the 37th District of California, a woman with almost unlimited interests and abilities, we have also gained a sage and experienced legislator, and in keeping with her first career I believe she can teach us a great deal.Join me now, my colleagues, in welcoming our newest colleague, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Millender-McDonald].,2015-03-16 17:57:43.362966,2015-03-16 17:57:43.362966,House,A WELCOME TO THE HONORABLE JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE,1996-04-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-16/html/CREC-1996-04-16-pt1-PgH3394-4.htm,48,2,142,H3394-H3395,G000132,mr. gephardt

This document should provide NASA's current plan for reaching the fiscal year 2000 FTE figure.

344,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, with some reluctance, I rise to oppose the D.C. appropriations bill and to urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit that will prevent the use of Federal funds for private school vouchers.Here we are again, on the floor of the House debating an appropriations bill that should have been passed 4 months ago. But the Republican majority continues to mismanage the people's business, seeking to bootstrap their radical ideas to regular spending bills. And this D.C. appropriations bill is the latest egregious example of their scheme of legislative blackmail.I commend my colleague from Wisconsin, Mr. Gunderson, for his good faith attempt to help the District of Columbia improve its public schools. The citizens of this city and their elected officials have embraced many of his ideas. But, they have categorically rejected the idea that public dollars should be siphoned off to finance private school education. And, yet this conference report ignores the expressed will of D.C. citizens because radical elements in the Republican Party insist that its their way or the highway. Those same elements have made clear their intent to destroy public education, and they are wiling to trample on the democratic rights of over one-half million U.S. citizens in order to gain a foothold in their war against public education. While this Capitol Building is the seat of national Government, it is not the ``big house'' and the District of Columbia is not Jerry Falwell's plantation.Isn't it ironic that the very people who complain about Federal intrusion into the affairs of local school districts, and other aspects of modern life for that matter, are fighting to impose a federally funded, federally mandated private school voucher plan on the District of Columbia? Rest assured, if they try to force that idea on my constituents they will be in for the fight of their political lives.Mr. Speaker, by substantial margins the American people rate improvement of public education as their No. 1 priority. I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to highjack Federal tax dollars that instead should address that priority.,2015-03-16 17:57:43.646167,2015-03-16 17:57:43.646167,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2546, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996,1996-01-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-01-31/html/CREC-1996-01-31-pt1-PgH1064.htm,13,99,142,H1064-H1077,C000488,mr. clay
345,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.Mr. Chairman, this bill authorizes States to arbitrarily and capriciously waive provisions of important Federal education programs under the guise of granting flexibility to local school systems. I support flexibility in the administration of Federal education programs, but only if it is coupled with strong accountability provisions and preserves the emphasis on serving the poorest children.This bill fails on both accounts. First, it provides no accountability for ensuring reliable reporting and increased student achievement. Second, it allows States to significantly diminish the mission of Title I, which is to serve the poorest schools and the poorest children before the more advantaged.Mr. Chairman, it is legislative folly to let States waive elementary and secondary programs before beginning authorizing and drafting the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.There is no urgency for this bill. Current law authorizes and Secretary Riley has waived hundreds of Federal education laws to grant flexibility to States and school districts. The Secretary testified that he believes this measure should be considered with the overall ESEA authorization, and the GAO reported that there is insufficient information to assess the Ed-Flex pilot that allowed waivers in 12 States.Mr. Chairman, data from the National Assessment of Education Progress showed that 9-year-olds in the poorest schools improved their reading scores by 8 points, or almost one grade level between 1992 and 1998. It also pointed out that 10 out of 13 urban districts showed dramatic increases in math and reading for elementary students in the highest poverty schools. These results are directly attributable to Title I assistance. Measurable success in these areas should serve to broaden our commitment to increasing investment in public schools, to continue our targeting to the poorest children, and to insist on greater accountability for results.Presently, the Title I statute allows schools with at least 50 percent of their children from low-income families to operate a schoolwide program. These programs allow schools with high concentrations of poverty to combine Federal funding to reach certain funding goals. This provision has been a vital reform in Title I schools because it allows schools to coordinate efforts among Federal programs targeted at the most needy children. That will not happen without such authority.Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) will offer an amendment to prohibit schools with less than 35 percent poverty from operating a schoolwide program. The Republican majority and Democrats who support this bill claim that H.R. 800 will not reduce funding for poor children. However, an initial report from the Department of Education found that waivers reduced funds for poor children by 18 percent in 1995 to 1996. And if this trend is extended nationwide, it would have a devastating effect on most disadvantaged schoolchildren.The Republican majority claims that this legislation provides the proper balance between accountability and flexibility. I disagree. The accountability provisions in this legislation must be strengthened if the majority's claim is to be more than political rhetoric.Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) will offer an amendment to improve the accountability provisions in this legislation. The amendment would require States to have their content and performance standards and aligned assessments required under the Title I statute in place. In addition, this amendment would reinforce the sound education principle that assessment should measure change in student performance from year-to-year and separate out data based on categories of at-risk children.Lastly, Mr. Chairman, the amendment would require States to hold LEAs accountable for educational objectives and goals as required by the act and to close the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their peers.Mr. Chairman, this bill will provide most States with new, sweeping authority to waive Federal law. Given that the Federal Government will invest an additional $50 billion in education funding over the next several years, these accountability provisions are more than appropriate. They are compulsory.I believe that H.R. 800 in its present form lacks sufficient accountability and targeting and will jeopardize the long-standing mission of Title I to assist in the education of our disadvantaged children. While the majority has sought to capitalize on the simplicity of the call for more flexibility, we do not believe that should be at the expense of educating needy children.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 17:57:43.808286,2015-03-16 17:57:43.808286,House,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-10/html/CREC-1999-03-10-pt1-PgH1089-2.htm,38,3,145,H1089-H1115,C000488,mr. clay
346,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to recognize the accomplishments of Dr. J. Eugene Grigsby, Jr. who, on October 17, 1998, will celebrate his eightieth birthday.Dr. Grigsby is a distinguished artist, educator and author. His art work is represented in numerous public and private collections throughout the world. He has had one man exhibits in Luxembourg, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Ohio and New York. In addition, his work has been included in group exhibits in Louisiana, Maryland, Illinois, Georgia, Nigeria, Florida, California, Texas, Washington, New Jersey, Iran, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina.Dr. Grigsby began his teaching career as an art instructor at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1941. In 1946, he was recruited to establish an art program and department at Carver High School in Phoenix, Arizona. From there, he moved on to Phoenix Union High School and then to Arizona State University in 1966. He retired as professor of art from Arizona State University in 1988. In 1958, Dr. Grigsby was one of a select group of American artists invited to serve as artist in residence at the Children's Creative Center in the American Pavilion during the Brussels, Belgium World Fair.Gene Grigsby has written numerous articles on art and art education. His writings have appeared in Arts &amp; Activities, Black Art Quarterly, School Arts, and The Journal of the National Art Education Association. His landmark book, Art &amp; Ethnics, is used extensively in public schools throughout the nation as a resource on teaching about diversity and art in America.Dr. Grigsby has been affiliated with and held leadership positions in numerous professional organizations and associations throughout his long and distinguished career. He has been president of the Arizona Art Education Association; chair of the Consortium of Black Organizations and Others for the Arts; chair of the Artists of the Black Community/Arizona; Chair of the Committee on Minority Concerns of the National Art Education Association; and vice-president of the National Art Education Association. His civic involvement has included being president of the Booker T. Washington Child Development Center, serving as a board member of the Phoenix Opportunities Industrialization Center, the Garfield Neighborhood Association, the Arizona State University Performing Arts Board, the Neighborhood Housing Service of Phoenix, the Phoenix Art Museum, the Phoenix Urban League, Phoenix Festivals, the South Mountain Magnet School Advisory Board, and the Advisory Board of Discover Art the art textbook widely used in grades 1-6.Dr. Grigsby has received numerous awards for his achievements. This year the National Art Education Association named him their ``Retired Educator of the Year''. He has also received distinguished service awards from his alma mater, Morehouse College, from The Miami University of Ohio and The Arizona Alliance of Black School Educators. He has been honored by Four Corners Art Education Association, the University of Arizona and the National Gallery of Art. The Arizona State University Graduate College bestowed the ``Distinguished Research Scholar'' award upon him in 1983. In 1989 Grigsby received the Arizona Governor's ``Tostenrud Art Award'' for contributions to the Arts of Arizona and in 1992 he was the first African American to receive the Arizona History makers Award presented by the State of Arizona. Inducted into the History maker Hall of Fame along with Grigsby were Barry Goldwater and Sandra Day O'Connor. In 1965 the Philadelphia College of Art awarded him the Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts.Dr. Grigsby has also been cited by the Phoenix OIC, the Arizona NAACP, and numerous schools, churches and community organizations for his selfless contributions of time, effort and expertise. The Meritorious Service Award of the National Art Education Association has been named the ``Eugene Grigsby Award for Service to Art Education'' in recognition of his significant contributions to the field of art education. In addition, his accomplishments are noted in numerous publications including: Who's Who Among African Americans; Who's Who in the World; Who's Who in America; Who's Who in American Art; Who's Who in the West; and Who's Who in Black America. Chapters on him also can be found in Art: African American; Those Who Serve; Contributions of Afro-Americans to the Visual Arts; Paths Toward Freedom, Biohistory of Blacks and Indians in North Carolina; Afro-American Artists, Dimensions in Black; Black Artists on Art; and American Negro Art.Dr. Grigsby is still widely in demand as a guest speaker. The former Danforth Fellow has lectured, conducted workshops and demonstrations on African Art, African American artists, and teaching art to high school students throughout the United States and in 13 countries in Africa, South America, the Caribbean and Australia.Gene Grigsby received his undergraduate education at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. He went on to earn the Master of Arts degree from The Ohio State University and the Ph.D from New York University in 1963. While in college Grigsby was an art major and a theater minor. He was an active participant in the Atlanta University Players as an actor and as a scenic designer. While attending Art School in New York, he was a participating member of the Rose McClendon Players as actor and scenic designer and was a member of the Langston Hughes' Suitcase Theatre. Grigsby was an apprentice to the scenic designer Perry Watkins for the Broadway Production, ``Mamba's Daughters''. He was a founding member of the Ohio State University Playmakers while attending The Ohio State University. In Phoenix, he became a member of the Civic Drama Festival as an actor and scenic designer.Grigsby, a 1942 volunteer for World War II, was Master Sergeant of the 573rd Ordinance Ammunition Company under 3rd Army's General George Patton. He devised the method of providing ammunition to the fast moving 3rd Army from Omaha Beach through France, Luxembourg and Germany to the Battle of the Bulge, by issuing ammunition from trucks instead of unloading it on the ground and reloading it on to trucks. After the war in Europe he wrote, produced and directed a hit musical comedy for the 573rd Army Battalion with soldiers from the 572nd and the 583rd Companies entitled ``Two Points Shy''. This production entertained soldiers in the German cities of Furth, Nuremberg and Hamburg among others. It received commendations from the 3rd Army Commanding Officer.Gene Grigsby has been a creative dynamo for all of his adult life. His creative energy and talent have helped to train thousands of young artists and art educators. He continues to be a mentor to those who have known and worked with him for over fifty years.Gene Grigsby and his loving and supportive wife of over 55 years--Thomasena--continue to reside in Phoenix, Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to count Gene and Tommy Grigsby among my friends, and I am proud to salute the distinguished career of this great artist, are educator and American citizen.,2015-03-16 17:57:43.946381,2015-03-16 17:57:43.946381,Extensions,80TH BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO DR.

So I actually sat in the bill signing ceremony for No Child Left Behind after having voted ``no'' the same way you did.And I think that is precisely what the public wants. They want to take this place apart. Education can be done fine at a State level, and in my opinion, as a former State representative, I would say it ought to be done at the local level.

351,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Families for Home Education (FHE) in observance of Home Education Week, May 2-8, in my home State of Missouri. I join with the Missouri General Assembly in recognizing their commitment not only to excellence in education, but also to the promotion of public policy that strengthens the family.Home educators make tremendous sacrifices to educate our nation's young people and they are making a difference. Countless studies show that parental involvement positively impacts the education of a child. Home-schooled children, in particular, benefit greatly from the individualized, one-on-one training they receive from dedicated parents and home educators. They are also afforded unique opportunities to participate in apprenticeships, and community and civic organizations. These activities serve to strengthen social skills and enrich their overall educational experience.In today's challenging society, it is more important than ever that our young people receive a quality education if they are to succeed in the expanding global market. Home educators play a vital part in preparing children, tomorrow's workforce, to successfully compete and prosper in the adult world. I commend these dedicated parents and FHE, and wish them continued success in their endeavors. ,2015-03-16 18:00:16.020476,2015-03-16 18:00:16.020476,Senate,RECOGNITION OF FAMILIES FOR HOME EDUCATION,1999-04-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-29/html/CREC-1999-04-29-pt1-PgS4469-5.htm,60,0,145,S4469-S4470,B000611,mr. bond
352,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senior Senator from Missouri for his introduction of the ``Direct Check for Education'' bill. It is with great pleasure that I add my name as a cosponsor of this important legislation, which will improve the educational opportunities for our nation's school children by sending federal resources directly to local school districts to use in the way they know will benefit students most effectively.Mr. President, when we talk about education, we should start by asking: ``What do our parents want for their children? We know that parents want their children to get a first-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. Parents want schools that are safe, classes that are small, and principals and teachers to have authority to make the right decisions in all areas of learning, school discipline and after-school activities. Parents want teachers who care for students and know the subjects they teach. Parents do not want Washington in control of classrooms.The next question we should ask is: How can we attain what parents want? How can our children achieve academic excellence? The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question in a report released in July of 1998, called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The Subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives, but instead were characterized by: parental involvement in the education of their children, local control, emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance.Knowing the ingredients of educational success for our children, we must next ask whether our current federal education programs contain these ingredients.First, we should observe that in a sense, the federal government has played conflicting roles in education, providing resources with one hand, while creating obstacles with the other. We have spent over $12 billion on major education programs in the last two years, and this year, we are slated to spend nearly $15 billion. Yet, if current trends continue, only about 65% of federal education dollars will be spent this year on educating our children, due to the excessive bureaucracy in our federal programs.And we should remember that federal funding accounts for only about 7% of the total amount spent on education, while the lion's share comes from state and local taxes. However, that 7% of the funding pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts need to administer education programs. Unfortunately, most federal education programs often do not contain the basic ingredients for educational success, but rather contain components that can actually stifle the ingredients for success.In the last 35 years, the federal government has continued to take away parental involvement, local control, flexibility, and teacher and community input by spinning a complex web of federal elementary and secondary education programs, each of which contain their own set of rules that consume the time and resources of states and school districts.A 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total education funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to oversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar.Many federal programs have taken away precious dollars and teacher time. Rather than being able to spend time on classroom preparation, teachers instead have to spend hours filling out federal forms to comply with federal rules.Another problem with a number of our federal education programs is that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars that their parents pay for education. This is because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. In essence, local schools must come to Washington and beg for the money taxpayers sent to the federal treasury. As a result, smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer, cannot share in the money their parents sent to the federal government.To make matters worse, once a school district is successful in obtaining a competitive grant after a harrowing application process, it must spend countless hours and resources complying with the leviathan of regulations and rules attached to the grant.Competitive funding, along with the vast number of federal education programs, has led to a cottage industry in selling information on education program descriptions, filing instructions, and application deadlines for each of these programs. The ``Education at a Crossroads'' report I mentioned earlier describes this cottage industry:``The Education Funding Research Council identifies potential sources of funds for local school districts, and sells for nearly $400 the Guide to Federal Funding for Education. The company promises to steer its subscribers to ``a wide range of Federal programs,'' and offers these subscribers timely updates on ``500 education programs.'' More recently, the Aid for Education Report published by CD Publications advertised that ``huge sums are available. . .in the federal government alone, there are nearly 800 different education programs that receive authorization totaling almost a hundred billion dollars.''It's a shame that a school district has to pay $400 for a catalog to learn how to get back the money that its community has sent to Washington to educate its children. But sadly, this is often the case.A third problem we can identify with many current federal education programs is that federal dollars are often earmarked for one particular use, and cannot be used for any other purpose. This inflexible funding hurts schools that have other needs than the ones prescribed by the federal government. A recent example of this is the $1.2 billion earmarked last year for classroom size reduction. While more teachers and class size reduction are noble endeavors, some schools don't need more teachers, but instead need more computers. However, the only use of this $1.2 billion can be for hiring more teachers. Such a policy flies in the face of one ingredient for educational success, local control.So, we know we have created a lot of federal education programs and we have dedicated a great deal of resources for these programs. What results are we getting? The National Center for Education Statistics' NAEP 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States reveals that 40 percent of fourth graders do not read at a basic level. The same report also indicates that half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time, if at all. And the NAEP Report Card also shows that United States 12th graders only outperformed two out of 21 nations in mathematics. The Brookings Institution released a study in April of 1998 indicating that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students.Knowing these disastrous results, we cannot afford to keep spending our federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing for years if it's not stimulating academic success. Parents, teachers, school boards, and members of our community won't stand for this kind of failure. They want and need opportunities to be more involved in deciding how to spend the federal education dollar, because they know what works. We must spend our federal resources for elementary and secondary education in ways that embrace the ingredients of success.Rather than fund the patchwork of federal elementary and secondary education programs that Washington wants, Congress should send that money directly to local school districts. Parents and teachers need the financing, flexibility and freedom to fund programs they know will improve their children's education.Senator Bond's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal does just this. He takes some of the Department of Education's largest competitive grant programs and returns the money in the form of a ``direct check'' to the local school districts based on the number of students in each district. Schools may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement.Under the ``Direct Check'' proposal, no longer would school districts have to come to Washington and beg for the money they sent to Washington to educate their children. No longer would teachers and administrators have to spend countless and wasted hours filling out federal grant application and compliance forms. No longer would schools be forced to earmark federal dollars for programs that have no relevance to their students' needs. Rather, school districts with the input of teachers, school boards, administrators, and of course, parents, would have the authority and flexibility to use federal dollars for what they best see fit.For example, local schools could deploy resources to hire new teachers, raise teacher salaries, buy new textbooks or new computers--whatever the schools deem most important to the educational success of their students. The Direct Check to Education proposals gives schools more time, flexibility, and money to spend on what's most important: providing classroom instruction to our nation's children.With the flexible, equitable distribution of federal funding under Senator Bond's proposal comes accountability. Local school districts will be penalized for knowingly submitting false information regarding the number of students in their districts. Moreover, the Secretary of Education may audit local educational agency expenditures to ensure that funds are used in accordance with the Direct Check in Education Act. And most importantly, parents, school boards, and members of the community will be able to give direct input into funding decisions, since those decisions will be made right in the community, rather than hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of miles away in Washington, D.C. Local decision making allows for local accountability.Mr. President, we have learned from experience that our many of our current federal education programs and dollars are not producing what we expect for our students. We know that successful education programs occur when crucial decisions are made by local communities, teachers, school boards, and parents. This is why I support Senator Bond's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal. His plan embraces the ingredients of educational success, as it gives parents, teachers and school boards the authority and flexibility to direct funds to programs they know work for their children.As I said earlier, Senator Bond's proposal consolidates a number of the Department of Education's federal programs for elementary and secondary education. I believe we should explore whether other federal education programs--both within and outside the Department of Education--should also be taken and put into a ``direct check'' to our local school districts. We must continue to look for ways to direct our federal resources in ways that reflect the ingredients of success and educational excellence for our children.

353,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Souder]. I ask to speak to the House today only because we have carried the debate on this amendment over the weekend, from Friday to today.Certainly, the gentleman from Maryland suggested that there were people who would be supporting this amendment who had voted one way or another in 1995. I know many of my friends will support this amendment who are friends of vocational education and would not have been voting the way he suggested in 1995. I know for sure I did not vote that way in 1995, since I was not here in 1995.Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment about whether we are going to increase funding for OSHA or increase funding for vocational education. It is $11 million, the increase in the OSHA bill. Apparently, the vocational education, adult education appropriation had no increase.At one time, in the early information that we received, it said that there was an $11 million decrease in vocational education. That got me to thinking about why at a time when we are focusing on welfare reform, when we are focusing on getting people to work, when we have just made the significant steps we made to encourage education beyond high school with the tax bill that many of the people who are speaking against this amendment were appropriately and actively for, we would want to just leave vocational education in place and perhaps even cut vocational education, as the early analysis of the bill said we were going to do.Mr. Chairman, assuming vocational education is where it was last year, and we have $11 million, the question that this amendment really brings to the floor is whether we take that $11 million and spend it for more OSHA or we take that $11 million and spend it for more vocational and adult education.This process is about choices. This amendment proposes a different choice than the choice presented by the committee. I am a believer in vocational education. I think vocational education may very well, one could argue, be more important than it has ever been as we try to move people to the workplace that have not been to the workplace.Clearly, OSHA is not achieving the results in the workplace that we want to achieve. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Clay], who mentioned the numbers of deaths appropriately, we should be concerned about those numbers of deaths. But the gentleman also mentioned that there are inspectors in OSHA that would allow every business to be inspected only once every 167 years.Mr. Chairman, I think a better way to provide workplace safety, even these two choices, is to train people before they go to the workplace so that they are better prepared to be there. I think that is a better effort to get workplace safety than an $11 million increase in OSHA would be.Certainly, the vocational education reforms that this Congress will approve spend money more nearly at the local level. I think that is a good change in vocational education. Ninty percent of the money will be spent for the first time under these new guidelines at the local level. This will be money that is spent to strengthen academics, to broaden opportunities after high school, to send more dollars to classrooms for people who are not headed to college.Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of American youth do not complete a 4-year college degree. Those people are very much in need of additional beyond-high school training.Mr. Chairman, it is clear that more than half of the new jobs that have been and will be created in the decade of the 1990s will take education beyond high school. Well, 25 to 35 percent of the people going to high school are not graduating from high school to start with in virtually any State. The 75 percent that do not graduate from college need that additional training to fill the jobs that are created in this decade, for many of them their first decade in the workplace.I think vocational education is important. I think adult education is important. By the way, this amendment does not say to take the money out of compliance or even to take it out of inspection. It takes the money out of OSHA and puts money in the Perkins bill vocational education.Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of that money goes to vocational education; 10 percent goes to programs for single parents; 8 percent to State level programs and activities; and 5 percent for State administration. Ninty cents of these dollars are getting directly to individuals.This is about choices. I am encouraging the choice that this amendment proposes and appreciate the opportunity to get to address the House on this day, the second day that we deal with this legislation.,2015-03-16 18:00:16.353720,2015-03-16 18:00:16.353720,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-08/html/CREC-1997-09-08-pt1-PgH6977-5.htm,117,31,143,H6977-H6999,B000575,mr. blunt
354,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,I believe the fundamental opportunity in education and the opportunity for achievement by children relates to the involvement of parents in education. Whenever we begin to dictate curriculum from Washington, with a national test which will ultimately define curriculum, we will have lost the genius of America's education system, which is local involvement in schools, parental involvement.For that reason, I believe this amendment should be adopted. I am pleased that Senator Lott has been in support of this amendment. I am pleased that a number of other individuals are supporting it strongly and am glad to have the cosponsorship of Senator Hagel. I urge its adoption.I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nickles be added as a cosponsor.,2015-03-16 18:00:16.510825,2015-03-16 18:00:16.510825,Senate,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS,1998-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-22/html/CREC-1998-04-22-pt1-PgS3410.htm,45,119,144,S3410-S3423,A000356,mr. ashcroft
355,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Mary Ann Schiller with the Affirm School District. She began working in the Affton School District as a high school senior in 1950 as an assistant to the superintendent's secretary. She attended Miss Hickey's Secretarial School in the evening while working as secretary to the principal at Reavis School during the day.In 1960 she moved to the administration center to serve the assistant superintendent of elementary education. In 1970, Mrs. Schiller became the secretary to the superintendent (later administrative assistant) as well as secretary to the Board of Education, positions she held for 40 years. She has been the indispensable ``right hand'' to eight superintendents and a patient mentor to nearly 70 Board of Education members.On June 15, 2010, the Affton School District's Board of Education unanimously voted to dedicate and rename the Affton School District Administration Center in her honor. On October 2, 2010 the administration center will be renamed the Mary Ann Schiller Administration Center.Other honors for Mary Ann include: the recipient of the Service and Outstanding Achievement Recognition (SOAR) Award for 1996-97; named Affton Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year in 1999; and one of ten distinguished alumni inducted into the Affton Hall of Fame in 2005.Mary Ann was also named by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as a Pioneer in Education--an honor never before bestowed upon a classified school district employee.Mary Ann Schiller retired on June 30, 2010 after 60 years of service to the Affton School District. I honor Mary Ann today for her outstanding public service; performing one of the most important tasks necessary for a successful and healthy nation: educating the young and preparing them to be productive and responsible citizens.,2015-03-16 18:00:16.638921,2015-03-16 18:00:16.638921,Extensions,HONORING MARY ANN SCHILLER,2010-09-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-09-29/html/CREC-2010-09-29-PT2-PgE1845.htm,133,0,156,E1845,C001060,mr. carnahan
356,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Missouri home schoolers who will observe Missouri Home Education Week, May 3-May 9, 1998. As a parent and former educator, it is a privilege for me to participate in celebrating this event.As a nation we promote education as a key to success. A good education is associated with responsible, intelligent, and productive citizenship. To maintain greatness as a nation, we must strive for excellence as individuals. And the standard of excellence is largely set by our nation's leaders--especially those in the home. Training in the home that guides children in setting the highest standards for their lives is essential to the continuity of morality in our culture. I am encouraged by all parents and students who take on the task of education in the home.There is no bigger responsibility than being a parent. It is my desire that parents be role models to their children. Teachers have always had a place as role models in our society. Each of us can probably remember a teacher who pushed us to achieve more and to reach higher. We are thankful for the leadership of those who promote education and serve as role models. So for home schooling parents, may you find inspiration in performing the dual role of parent and teacher, and may you be doubly rewarded for your efforts.In Missouri, home schooling has had great success. I look forward to the continued contributions that Missouri home schoolers will have in education and to the positive impact home schooled children will have in Missouri's communities and across the United States.,2015-03-16 18:00:16.783024,2015-03-16 18:00:16.783024,Senate,MISSOURI HOME SCHOOLERS,1998-03-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-30/html/CREC-1998-03-30-pt1-PgS2763-2.htm,38,0,144,S2763,A000356,mr. ashcroft
357,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, let me take this time to honor a dedicated military educator, Lieutenant General Frances C. Wilson, who will be retiring as the President of the National Defense University, after having served this nation for 37 years in the United States Marine Corps.Culminating with her appointment as President of the National Defense University in 2006, General Wilson has, throughout her career, focused on professional education while working tirelessly to create an educated and well-trained class of American warriors. She has completed seven advanced training courses, including Harvard's Senior Executive Course in National Security, and earned four Master degrees along with a Doctorate in Education. Through these impressive academic undertakings, General Wilson acquired the knowledge and skills needed to prepare America's future officers for the complex contemporary world.Most impressively, General Wilson has relentlessly used her extensive education to increase the capabilities of our Armed Forces. She commanded the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island, directed the Manpower Management Division at Marine Corps Headquarters, and managed the military's Reserve forces while a member of the Reserve Force Policy Board. Through her leadership in these posts, General Wilson greatly advanced the professional development of the marines under her command and helped to mold a vibrant military education system.As President of the National Defense University, General Wilson understood the critical need for National Security Professionals within the Executive Branch. She spearheaded the development of the National Security Education Consortium and, recognizing the importance of international cooperation, established educational partnerships with 79 nations, especially our NATO allies. Additionally, she added three Masters degrees to the University's curriculum while managing NDU's reaccredidation process. As a strong proponent of military education myself, I could not be more pleased with General Wilson's efforts or the many accolades she has received over her long career.General Wilson's leadership has strengthened both the Marine Corps and the professional military education system. As a staunch believer in continuous education for professional soldiers, I am proud of her commitment to lifelong study and the development of America's warriors. I trust that Members of the House will join me in congratulating General Wilson for her contributions to the United States of America.,2015-03-16 18:00:16.928129,2015-03-16 18:00:16.928129,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL FRANCES C.

358,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and support Arts Advocacy Day. I would like to thank the artists who have come to Capitol Hill to visit with members of Congress regarding support for arts education as essential to the creative ingenuity of the cultural fabric of our society. We appreciate their extraordinary talent and we welcome them to Washington.The Congress must provide sufficient funding for arts education in our schools and the National Endowment for the Arts. These programs are vital to supporting the creation, preservation and presentation of the arts and humanities in America. In my district, numerous schools have taken essential steps toward integrating arts education in their student's daily routines. Unfortunately, budget cuts threaten the longevity of these programs. Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. A U.S. Department of Justice study found that arts education reduced student delinquency in San Antonio by 13% and increased the communications skills of students in Atlanta by 57%. Test Results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores that other students. I'm proud to have been part of the legislative effort to empower the Secretary of Education to fund arts education programs in our schools through the No Child Left Behind Education Act of 2003.Beyond our borders, the WTO must stand firm against the piracy of our artists' intellectual property. We in Congress must strengthen our commitment and effort with our trading partners to end piracy. Theft of intellectual property has a significant economic affect on the United States. The recording industry, for example, reports a loss of $286 million in sales with our trading partner, China. In addition, market access and investment barriers prevent the entertainment industry from serving markets overseas thus and increases demand for pirated U.S. entertainment products. The Congress and the United States Trade Representative need to work together to apply pressure to the governments of countries where piracy is rampant.Mr. Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to Arts Advocacy Day.,2015-03-16 18:00:17.062223,2015-03-16 18:00:17.062223,Extensions,ARTS ADVOCACY DAY,2004-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-31/html/CREC-2004-03-31-pt1-PgE497-3.htm,43,0,150,E497-E498,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
359,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise in opposition to this martial law rule.Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House Republican leadership at a press conference boasted about the Republicans' imaginary legislative accomplishments in the field of education. What folly, what gall, what audacity. Their refusal to tackle critical educational problems and priorities is the shame of this Congress. It is the shame of their party.The Republican policy toward education is based on the contemptuous premise that education is not the province of the Federal Government. So, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans will do as little as possible to improve our educational system, and then only when forced to do it. Their sorry, sordid record on education issues is one of complete failure.They fail to invest in the expansion of after-school programs, they fail to reduce classroom sizes, they fail to bring new technology to our schools, they fail to replace dilapidated school houses and replace them with new buildings.They failed to hire 100,000 new public school teachers.Mr. Speaker, Republicans have failed our school children, failed their parents, failed our public school teachers and failed their responsibility to give leadership in the area of critical national concern. Their scheme to enact school vouchers would have diverted hundreds of millions of Federal dollars earmarked for public schools and school reform to private and parochial schools.Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority tried to repeal affirmative action programs for disadvantaged youth and tried to destroy bilingual education. Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Republicans' most sinister, most cynical, perversion was the attempt to kill the Head Start program by loading it down with nongermane killer amendments like Head Start vouchers.In the past few days, we have seen a flurry of activity on measures that have languished for the past 2 years, but the record of this do-nothing Congress in the field of education is clear.Thus far, only three education bills have become law during this Congress: job training, higher education renewal and the IDEA program.Mr. Speaker, we demand, the American public demands, that the Republican leadership take immediate action to enact legislation to modernize our decrepit, run-down public schools and to reduce our classrooms to manageable and teachable sizes.Mr. Speaker, we should vote this rule down. This proposal is bad for this country and we should stay here until we finish the business of government, the business of the American people. I say vote ``no'' on this resolution.,2015-03-16 18:00:17.195312,2015-03-16 18:00:17.195312,House,WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 4(B) OF RULE XI WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS REPORTED FROM COMMITTEE ON RULES,1998-10-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-10/html/CREC-1998-10-10-pt1-PgH10356-6.htm,142,7,144,H10356-H10365,C000488,mr. clay

361,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, this week is National Teacher Appreciation week and our attention is focused on education. As the elected Representative of Missouri's Ninth Congressional District, I have the distinct honor of representing sixteen colleges and universities, and a plethora of public and private schools which help prepare students to enter these educational institutions.Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to honor all of the hard working individuals who work in these educational institutions in central and northeastern Missouri. Each and every one deserves accolades for their role in providing excellence in education.Today, however, I would like to point the national spotlight to highlight one of many devoted teachers who have dedicated their lives to provide quality education in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District.Last month, Mr. Stan Taylor of Columbia, Missouri, stopped by my district office to request a congratulations letter be sent to his wife, Karen, on her retirement from the Columbia Public School system. Karen began teaching in 1961 in a rural, one room school house called East Center School in Kirksville, Missouri. She had the tremendous responsibility for teaching all grades, first through twelve, at East Center School.In 1967, Karen began teaching within the Columbia Public School District, and for the last twenty years she has taught second grade elementary school at Rock Bridge Elementary School in Columbia, Missouri.Mr. Speaker, as I learned of Karen's dedication to improve education in Missouri's Ninth District, I felt if befitting that I recognize her special efforts, and in doing so, I honor all of those like her who have dedicated their professional lives to help enhance the education of their students.Not surprisingly, I do not stand alone in placing this honor. On May 22nd, the Missouri Teachers Association and more than 300 people--family, friends, colleagues and former students--will help celebrate Karen's educational efforts at Rock Bridge Elementary School during a reception to commemorate her retirement after twenty years of teaching in the Columbia Public School system.Mr. Speaker, I would like to close with Mr. Taylor's words about his wife. He wrote that the most important lesson Karen stressed to her students was the power of knowledge through reading. Every day she would read to her students. It was her goal throughout her thirty year teaching career to encourage every student to become believers in the importance of reading. Thank-you Karen, for your devotion to your students and for providing excellent education for many generations of children. I stand here today to honor you and all those who share your commitment towards excellence in education. May we all celebrate National Teacher Appreciation Week with those who have given us the priceless gift of education.,2015-03-16 18:00:17.483522,2015-03-16 18:00:17.483522,House,``BELIEVERS IN READING'' HONORING KAREN TAYLOR AND NATIONAL TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK,1999-05-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-05/html/CREC-1999-05-05-pt1-PgH2780.htm,64,1,145,H2780,H000948,mr. hulshof
362,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I strongly support and urge Congress to pass and President Clinton to sign the Affordable Education Act now pending before the Senate. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation.Children presently are 25 percent of our population and 100 percent of the future. It is my fundamental belief that Congress should invest in the future by improving educational opportunities for students. This bill is part of a comprehensive strategy to give parents and local schools the resources needed to make the 21st century, the era in which educational excellence for all students is achieved.For the past three years, Congress has passed legislation that provides tax incentives to help parents pay for the education of their children. But President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation that provided these incentives. Parents across America hope and trust that this time these tax incentives will be enacted into law.A major feature of this bill is that it creates Educational Savings Accounts for K through 12 expenses. These ESAs allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually to an Educational Savings Account. The build-up of earnings within the account is tax-free if used for educational expenses, such as tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, computers, etc. The premise behind ESAs is that parents should have greater control over the education of their children. After all, who is in a better position to know what each child needs--a bureaucratic Washington government or the parents and teachers who see that child every day?This bill does more than just create Educational Savings Accounts. Included in this bill are other provisions that I have either supported or co-sponsored that:Provide tax incentives to help pay for college tuition;Provide tax exclusions for education assistance programs provided by employers;Revise the tax treatment of qualified state tuition programs to exclude from gross income any distributions used for higher education expenses;Allow a tax deduction of up to $2,500 per year of interest on education loans;Allow a limited tax credit for the donation of computers to schools, and extends from two to three years the age of computers that may be donated to schools; andReduce the complexity of the arbitrage rules that currently govern the issuance of school bonds.This bill provides more than $4.3 billion of education tax incentives for the next five years, and it gives more educational control to parents. Parents will be able to save more for the future education of their children.This bill is just one part of an overall strategy to increase educational resources. Over the past five years Congress has increased overall educational spending by 40 percent, and Congress last year approved a budget that projects yet another 36 percent increase over the next four years. In the next few weeks Congress will take up legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I will be offering amendments to that bill that will:Channel federal aid in failing school districts to teaching the academic basics in order to raise student achievement levels;Provide funds for failing school districts to use in attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers; andDouble the amount of federal aid for college costs for high achieving students in failing school districts.For now, however, Congress should take the first step in expressing its commitment to improving education by passing the pending Affordable Education Act. I urge Senators to support this legislation.,2015-03-16 18:00:17.627619,2015-03-16 18:00:17.627619,Senate,AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999--Continued,2000-03-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-02/html/CREC-2000-03-02-pt1-PgS1088.htm,22,206,146,S1088-S1111,A000356,mr. ashcroft
363,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, as we start this 106th Congress, I think it is clear that education is going to be one of the top priorities we will address in this session of Congress. We are going to be working on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and I believe all of us, on both sides, are saying that this is a national priority.As my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry, said in a speech that he made at Northeastern University, ``Ever since there has been a United States of America, there have been public schools. And there has been a constant debate about how to make them work.'' I know that since I was elected to the United States Senate 12 years ago I have listened and participated in the many debates on public education that have occurred in this institution. I have even had some ideas of my own on how to improve education--some of which have been passed by this body and signed into law.My intentions, like those of my Senate colleagues--have been good intentions. We all share the same goal of providing our children with a great education. We have been trying to do the right thing.Today, however, our good intentions have mushroomed into burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. Parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom. Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials we have empowered the federal government and bureaucrats. We have slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have once again established a system where supposedly the Olympians on the hill know what is best for the peasants in the valley.Mr. President, let me give you some examples of what our good intentions have gotten us.We have 760 education programs scattered throughout 39 different federal agencies. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review said that the Department of Education's discretionary grant process lasts 26 weeks and takes 487 steps from start to finish. The General Accounting Office has estimated that there are nearly 13,400 full-time jobs in the 50 states funded by the Department of Education with an additional 4,600 direct Department of Education employees.We have teachers being taken off the task of teaching, preparing lesson plans, taking on after school student activities, etc. and instead are researching for grant opportunities, reading regulations, preparing applications, filling out paperwork requirements, complying with cumbersome rules, and reporting on how they spend the federal money received. Or we have teachers and administrators deciding that the extra federal money is not worth the time and effort that it will take to get and comply with that they do not even bother to go through the process.Most of us are now aware of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, released last year by the National Center for Education Statistics, that ranked American senior high school students 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in math, and 16th out of the same 21 countries in science. In addition, 40 percent of our Nation's fourth graders do not read at even a basic level. Colleges across this country are spending over $1 billion a year in remedial education.Is this acceptable? Are we satisfied with the status quo? The answer should be--must be--an unequivocal NO.In our business we pay a lot of attention to polls. For several years, the polls across the country have been telling us that we have a problem with public education. This is not new news and the question remains the same: How do we fix public education?Mr. President, before I provide my answer to that question I want to take this opportunity to read from an editorial from a home-state newspaper, the Southeast Missourian.Nearly a decade ago, then-President Bush and the nation's governors set a series of goals for America's schoolchildren in reading, math, graduation rates and other measures. But the national education goals panel says the nation's public schools will fall short of the goals for 2000. We can only hope these continued failures to improve education will result in a overthrow of the so-called experts. These are the people, usually far removed from the classroom, who embrace quick fixes and fads in the face of each hand-wringing report. Unfortunately, the fixes make the problems worse. What's needed is to return America's schools back to the basics and back to local teachers, administrators, school boards, and parents. Without a foundation in the basics, the rest of education just won't take. We must take so-called remedies out of the hands of the federal government. National mandates are meaningless for America's schools. The problem must be addressed one district and one school at a time. Why not let classroom teachers-- instead of bureaucrats and politicians--fashion a plan to improve learning in the classroom? Give more control to the local districts in building reading retention, math skills and graduation rates?Mr. President, the editorial goes on, but it ends with the following:The answer to fixing America's educational woes rests with individual school boards and passionate educators. The bureaucrats must reduce the red tape and mandates that are strangling our schools. Give those who know best the time, talent and incentives to finally fix public education.I agree with the Southeast Missourian. The answer to improving public education does not lie within the halls of Congress or in the granite buildings of the downtown Washington education establishment. As the editorial stated, we are ``far removed from the classroom.''In my opinion, the real solutions--the laboratories--are local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not play the ``Mother, May I?'' game with Washington.Here in Congress we must not be afraid to propose change. But in proposing change we must go directly to those who can provide some answers--the teachers, principals, school administrators, school board members, and parents.For the past couple of years, I have done just that and have developed in conjunction with them the ``Direct Check for Education Act.Quite simply, the purpose of this bill is to consolidate six, primarily competitive grant programs of the Department of Education's programs. The programs are Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program. The bill then proposes to return the federal funding by issuing a ``Direct Check'' to the local school district based on the number of students in each district. The result would be a resource of flexible funding that would allow individual schools and parents to determine how best to use the funds, including the hiring of new teachers, additional classrooms, new textbooks, expanded technology initiatives, drug and alcohol prevention programs, etc. The list goes on and on.My ``Direct Check'' proposal is not the ``save-all'' answer. But the ``Direct Check'' will reduce the costly and time-consuming paperwork process that local school districts endure in obtaining federal grants and funding. It will treat children and schools the same by awarding funding to schools based upon the students served instead of rewarding some and penalizing others. My ``Direct Check for Education'' is a first step in simplifying and going ``back to the basics'' of education.Mr. President, there will be those in the Washington education establishment who will oppose this bill. Instead of finding ways to empower those at the local level the opposition will argue that we need even more federal programs, more bureaucracy, more micro management of the classroom.I believe the bottom line is this: Education, while a national priority, is a local responsibility. We must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, school boards, etc. because education decisions can best be made by people at the local schools who know the names and the challenges facing the students in those schools.Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold and let local school districts do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement.We have burdened it with excessive regulations and red tape. We have once again established a system where supposedly the ``olympians'' on the Hill know what is best for the ``peasants'' in the valley.I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Education is and must be a national priority. But the good intentions that we have had in this body have led to the creation of more than 760 Federal education programs. Has that made education better? I don't think so. We added three more last year. And now we gather that the President is going to come up with a grand new Federal scheme. How many people really believe that the 764th Federal education program is going to assure that our kids can read? Is it going to assure that we get our high school students out of the 19th place out of 21 in terms of mathematics? I don't believe so.Our system is not working. If you want to know how well it is working, go back home. Ask the teachers in your local school district. Ask the principals in your local school district. Ask the parents at home. Ask the school board members. If you do that, I believe you will hear what I have heard, time and time again: They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government. They are tired of spending the time to fill out the forms for the grants, to comply and jump through the hoops that the Federal Government sets out for them, to write the reports and fill out the evaluation forms that are needed, only to have a competitive grant program run out at the end of 3 years. They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government.We have an opportunity to do something that I think is very significant. Instead of going down the road that is going to be proposed of another new Federal program, we ought to take the remedies out of the hands of the Federal Government. National mandates are meaningless for American schools. The problems must be addressed one school district, one school, at a time. Why not let classroom teachers, the parents, the administrators--instead of bureaucrats and politicians--make the decisions on how to improve the education in their school districts? Give more control back to local districts and let them build reading retention, math skills, and improve graduation rates.Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill we call the direct check for education bill. It takes six of the major Federal competitive grant programs--Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, the Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program--and puts them into a pool. That pool is to be divided on the basis of the students--K through 12--on average daily attendance. And it is to be returned to those local school districts on the basis of the number of students they have. Very simple. Cut the Federal red tape. Let them use those education dollars.It starts off with a $3.5-million authorization, because we want to allow schools that already have competitive grants of multiyear tenure to complete those grants. At the end it will rise to $5 billion. It should come out to about $100 per student in every school--and turn the job back to the local schools, the parents, the teachers, the school board members, the administrators.There are those who oppose this approach. They argue that we need even more Federal control. But as I said at the beginning, while it is a national priority, education must be returned to the local school districts as a local responsibility, to empower the people who know the names of the kids, their problems, their challenges, and their opportunities, to make the decision.Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold. Let's let local schools do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement. Ask your teachers, your principals, your superintendents, your school board members; and then I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation that Senator Ashcroft and I are introducing today.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and common questions about the direct check for education bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-16 18:00:17.815758,2015-03-16 18:00:17.815758,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1999-01-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-01-19/html/CREC-1999-01-19-pt1-PgS345-2.htm,8,158,145,S345-S470,B000611,mr. bond

His education included the St. John High School Seminary in Kansas City, St Louis' Preparatory Seminary and the Theological College of Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. On May 31, 1945, he was ordained a priest. In 1954, he earned a doctorate in Sacred Theology.He served many parishes and education assignments. One of these assignments was superintendent of the diocesan schools in the Kansas City area. On July 2, 1969, Pope Paul VI appointed McAuliffe as the second Bishop of Jefferson City. He served in this position for 28 years. During his tenure, he had an active interest in parochial education. Approximately 13 years ago, he started the Diocesan Excellence in Education Fund.McAuliffe retired in 1995, at age 75, but remained the bishop until Pope John Paul II appointed the current bishop in 1997.Mr. Speaker, the Most Reverend Bishop Michael McAuliffe was a valuable leader in both the church and his community. I know the members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to his friends and family.,2015-03-16 18:00:18.617329,2015-03-16 18:00:18.617329,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF THE MOST REVEREND BISHOP MICHAEL F.

But the majority does not stop with just broken promises.Their budget eliminates funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools, eliminates funding for vocational education, eliminates programs that help ensure high-risk students can attend college, and eliminates 36 programs that help teachers and students succeed.

At a time when public schools are struggling to rebuild antiquated and crumbling school facilities and deal with a record enrollment of over 52 million students, we should not be considering proposals that divert scarce taxpayer dollars from our public school systems to subsidize private and religious schools.While school vouchers may benefit a small minority of children who have the option of attending a private or parochial school, school vouchers will ultimately condemn the vast majority of our children to an inferior education as a result of the shift in tax dollars from public education to private.This voucher proposal provides a select few a way out of the public school system while abandoning the vast majority of our children to underfunded and overcrowded schools. The hardest hit will be low-income, inner-city children who are already suffering from a lack of quality educational opportunity.Rather than defunding public schools, we need to be reinvesting in public schools. Our children's future success in the Information Age will depend on their ability to receive a quality education, and school vouchers are a nonanswer to that challenge.School vouchers are an attack against public education and an attack against our children. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote against this amendment.,2015-03-16 18:00:19.763136,2015-03-16 18:00:19.763136,House,NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001,2001-05-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-23/html/CREC-2001-05-23-pt1-PgH2590-2.htm,72,23,147,H2590-H2611,C001049,mr. clay

It is going to make a difference.This bill will make a difference as we work to make education more affordable. Vocational education, college education, $5,000 in tax credits over 4 years of college; tax savings accounts, education savings accounts that are going to be tax free, that allow families to save for college.

381,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, it is the thrust of this amendment that if you are on welfare and you have not completed your high school diploma the best way to get a job and keep a job is to achieve a level of education that our society expects of all adults, and that is a high school education.So this amendment would allow States to require individuals to get a high school education or its equivalent. This amendment is permissive, and it states that if you are a 20- to 50-year-old welfare recipient who does not have a high school diploma, you must begin working toward attaining a high school diploma or a GED as a condition of receiving benefits. An exception is made for people who are not capable.Job training will not equip welfare recipients to work if they have not achieved the basic and fundamental proficiency in education skills. How can we expect to train someone to work as a cashier if they cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide?The facts are indisputable. A person over 18 without a high school diploma averages $12,800 in earnings; with a high school diploma, averages $18,700 in earnings. Mr. President, $6,000 is the difference between dependence and independence; between welfare and work.This is permissive to the States.,2015-03-16 18:00:20.172428,2015-03-16 18:00:20.172428,Senate,RECESS,1996-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-23/html/CREC-1996-07-23-pt1-PgS8501.htm,109,54,142,S8501-S8532,A000356,mr. ashcroft
382,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to recommit.It is the height of irresponsibility for Republicans to hold education programs hostage to their plot to extract radical concessions through budget negotiations.Governing and politics are about give and take and good faith. Republicans need a lesson in both.Their failure to support a simple continuing resolution that funds education programs at fiscal year 1995 levels is creating serious problems for schools, teachers and children who have absolutely nothing to do with the budget fight. They are the innocent victims of a drive-by shooting. In this case, it is hard to tell who is driving this car. Is it the Speaker or the 73 Republican freshmen or the Christian coalition?The devastating cut in title I funding will deny 1.1 million needy children the crucial help they need in reading, writing, math, and critical thinking. Drug abuse and violence prevention programs will be cut for millions of students in nearly every school district in the country. Innovative school to work strategies developed at the local level will be halted. Teachers will be fired, classroom sizes will increase.With this continuing resolution, the Republicans are turning their backs on public education.

Student loans have been an essential tool for many students and families who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford the soaring costs of college tuition. However, in a few short weeks, Federal student loan interest rates are set to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent, making the dream of attaining college even more difficult for millions of students and families.We need to act now. It is our responsibility to ensure that all children have the ability to pursue higher education. The cost of attending college has gone up almost 30 percent in the last 10 years. We cannot afford to ignore struggling students across this Nation. In these uncertain economic times, we can make no greater investment than in education. More and more jobs require some sort of post-secondary education, and by 2018, just 6 years from now, 63 percent of employment opportunities will demand an education beyond high school.It is pathological partisanship that is preventing us from dealing with this important issue.,2015-03-16 18:00:20.871926,2015-03-16 18:00:20.871926,House,STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES,2012-06-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-06-07/html/CREC-2012-06-07-pt1-PgH3589-3.htm,85,1,158,H3589,C001061,mr. cleaver

387,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, the ability of our Nation to provide education and training opportunities to our people is more important now than ever before. Our success in the increasingly competitive global economy will largely depend upon the skills and productivity of our workers. Education and job training programs provide workers with the opportunity to learn and to improve their skills.It is our duty to make certain that those programs are effective and efficient. Many have criticized our current training system for being too duplicative and too sparse. The legislation we consider today will improve the coordination of services, provide quality assistance and foster efficiency.I am especially grateful that this agreement addresses the unique needs of dislocated workers as well as providing for meaningful local decisionmaking. As Members may remember, these issues were among the highest priorities advocated by Democrats during last year's deliberations on the careers bill. With respect to the adult education provisions of this bill, I believe that we have made solid progress. We have made sure that the program remains a part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that it will be administered by the State agency now in charge of adult education, that the program has a reasonable maintenance of effort standard, and that it will continue to serve a critically important role in the education of those who need its services.I want to particularly compliment the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] and the gentleman from California [Mr. McKeon] for their leadership and for their sincere efforts to make this a bipartisan effort on this bill. I appreciate their willingness to seek resolution of our differences on this issue. I also want to commend my Democratic colleague, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, Training and Life-Long Learning, for picking up where his predecessor, Pat Williams, left off by ensuring that any compromise adequately protects Democratic concerns.Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Kildee], the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, be given the authority to control the minority's time during general debate.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. McInnis).

I think this movement forward is helpful. We had frozen vocational education at last year's funding at a time when I think we are working in every possible way to get people to the workplace, people who have not been there before through welfare reform; people who are out of high school or did not get out of high school who need additional training.Vocational education is critically important. I am certainly glad to hear both the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Porter], the chairman, and the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], the ranking member, agree to accept this change to add this money to vocational education.Mr. Chairman, I look forward to this amendment becoming part of the package that the House passes, and then I am hopeful that we will also be committed, realizing what I just heard about the importance of everybody being in agreement, to uphold the House's position and keep this additional $20 million for vocational education in this bill when it comes back to the House from conference.This is an important step, going along with the step that we have already taken in passing the authorization legislation that, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania has pointed out, sets a new standard of money in vocational education that gets to the classroom where students are affected by it.That new standard of 90 percent, essentially under local control and maybe, more importantly, under the control of a local teacher, of the teacher in the classroom, as opposed to 75 percent, is an important standard for us to meet. To add to that some additional funding for vocational education in a program that is critical to the future of the country is going to be a good thing to see.I hope we see it in the final bill as well. I am grateful that the chairman and the ranking member have agreed to be supportive of this amendment and grateful to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Peterson] for not only letting me work with him but for working so hard to put this amendment together.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Barrett of Nebraska).

389,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President. Last month, I joined a bipartisan group of centrist Senators to support a $1.25 trillion tax cut along with an economic stimulus for this year. The tax cut agreed upon after negotiations with the White House and House of Representatives totals $1.35 trillion. I support a tax cut of this size and think that the people of Missouri also believe it to be a commonsense compromise.This tax cut should provide immediate tax relief to help stimulate the economy, cut personal income taxes for all taxpayers, eliminate the marriage penalty, and eliminate the estate tax for all family farms and family-owned small businesses. I also want to ensure that the tax cut is distributed fairly and responsibly by focusing on the people who need tax relief the most--the working men and women of America.The other key component of the budget voted on by the Senate last month was an approximately $300 billion investment in education over the next decade. That budget plan included sufficient funds to meet the Federal Government's commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education. Meeting this commitment would enable states and localities to spend billions of dollars of their own funds on improving educational quality at the local level. The Senate budget also included funds for student loans, programs for disadvantaged students, and the testing and accountability reforms currently being debated on the Senate floor.Unfortunately, the conference report before us completely eliminated the educational investments contained in the Senate passed budget. Indeed, this conference report does not even fund the education increases contained in President Bush's budget proposal.Not only is this approach to education inconsistent with the bipartisan actions taken on the budget by the Senate a few weeks ago, but it is dramatically at odds with the votes being cast by the Senate on the education reform bill. Last week, the Senate unanimously voted to fully fund the Individual with Disabilities Education Act at a cost of $120 billion over ten years. Earlier this week, the Senate agreed to fully fund the largest federal education program for disadvantaged students at a cost of $130 billion. The vote on that amendment was 79-21.I am a newcomer to the Federal budget process, but it defies common sense to be voting to support major increased investments in education on the one hand, while on the other hand voting for a budget that does not meet these commitments.Some of my colleagues have stated that the lack of education funding in the budget should not be of concern because, eventually, Congress will provide additional support for education during the appropriations process. But I ask, what purpose does a budget serve if we vote based on an intention not to abide by it?So, while I strongly support the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts for the American people contained in the conference report, I cannot support this budget agreement. I look forward to working on the tax cut legislation scheduled for later this month and on the appropriations bills that follow. Hopefully, in the end, we will provide both a tax cut of $1.35 trillion that provides needed tax relief to the public and an investment plan that meets our vital national priorities.,2015-03-16 18:00:21.520386,2015-03-16 18:00:21.520386,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--CONFERENCE REPORT,2001-05-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-10/html/CREC-2001-05-10-pt1-PgS4776-3.htm,64,55,147,S4776-S4794,C001043,mrs. carnahan
390,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support of H. Con. Res. 266, expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the benefits of music education.Music education has a long history, dating back to Ancient Greece. As part of a standard education, music was used to teach math and deemed equally important to forming a balanced individual. As a former educator, I know that an important component to youth development and a key solution to youth violence is access to art and music education in our schools. College Board studies have shown that students who play an instrument score significantly higher on their Scholastic Aptitude Tests than those who do not. High risk elementary students who participated in an arts program for one year gained eight percentile points on standardized language arts tests. Those who have exposure to music and art are less likely to have discipline problems. If we are serious about improving student achievement and curtailing youth violence in our schools, we must find adequate funding to bring music and art education to our children.Missouri's fifth district has taken major steps toward integrating arts education into the daily routine in schools. Magnet schools such as the Paseo Academy of Visual and Performing Arts and the Kansas City Middle School of the Arts teach children more than just reading, writing, and arithmetic. Students also learn how to create and appreciate music, painting, and dancing through hands-on experience. The Kansas City Symphony established an orchestral residency at the Paseo Academy to provide professional mentors to aspiring musicians. The results of programs like this are astounding. These schools have improved student test scores well above the district average and greatly increased parental satisfaction. Students enjoy attending school more than ever because of personal interest with the subject matter. I urge my distinguished colleagues to support this measure.Because of the vast amount of research proving the benefits of music education, we need to invest in more programs which will spark student interest in music such as the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) sponsored ``Challenge America'' initiative which would provide $50 million to more than 1,100 communities, bringing the arts and music to regions previously underserved by cultural programming.Music and art education remains important in the lives of children. From infants listening to classical music to facilitate brain development, to elementary students learning about music related careers from their favorite musicians, to high school instrument students who achieve above average SAT scores, the importance of music education cannot be denied. I urge my distinguished colleagues to continue to support music and art education programs such as ``Challenge America'' which contribute to the success of students as they become members of our democracy.,2015-03-16 18:00:21.676504,2015-03-16 18:00:21.676504,Extensions,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BENEFITS OF MUSIC EDUCATION,2000-06-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-14/html/CREC-2000-06-14-pt1-PgE1002.htm,74,0,146,E1002,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
391,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Chairman, this amendment, as has been read, transfers the increase in OSHA to vocational and adult education. In the last debate I believe I heard the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro] suggest that we need to challenge the House to spend more money on training. This amendment meets that challenge, and may be more timely even because of that challenge, that we spend more of our money on training.I think increasing spending in OSHA, as opposed to increasing spending in vocational and adult education, really just does not make sense to me, so this amendment is to transfer that increase. OSHA would be frozen. OSHA is being studied. There are field hearings on OSHA. There is nobody who is a member of this body who does not believe that OSHA needs to be significantly restructured in the way it does its job.At the same time, vocational and adult education have been incredibly successful programs that are actually funded below the 1997 levels. In a bill that funds programs that are not even authorized, vocational education and adult education are funded below last year's levels. I find that unacceptable.In fact, as we match these two things together, the best place to ensure workplace safety is in training. The best place to prevent accidents is before they happen. The best place to have workers prepare to be safe workers is not on the job, but before they get on the job, and vocational education has a track record of doing that effectively.This transfer would make sense from the training point of view. It freezes OSHA at the 1997 level. With this transfer we actually fund vocational education and adult education above the 1997 level. I urge its passage. I think when we look at the number of people that work in OSHA, the average business that is affected by OSHA really can anticipate a visit maybe as infrequently as once every 10 years. That does not ensure workplace safety.Well-trained workers do ensure workplace safety. Vocational education money and adult education money get people to work who have not been to work before. They increase the skills of those people who have not been to work before.On the other hand, OSHA often encourages people not to create jobs, and there are examples probably in every district represented in this House where people keep their employee numbers below 50 just so they will not have to deal with OSHA. When the OSHA inspector comes, it depends on which part of the OSHA code that inspector is familiar with on how the inspection goes that day. Training, Mr. Chairman, is the key to the workplace. It is the key to workplace safety.Leaving these two programs at levels below 1997 funding in this bill while we increase OSHA funding I think is unacceptable, so this amendment would rectify that situation. I urge its passage, Mr. Chairman.The CHAIRMAN.

392,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I applaud and salute Dr. Donohue on her tenure as President of the National Council for Occupational Education [NCOE].Dr. Patricia C. Donohue has provided dynamic leadership as the 1995-96 president of the National Council for Occupational Education. During her tenure, she focused on initiating exemplary policies and practices in economic development and workforce preparation for workers in our global economy, The NCOE's members are professionals in community and technical college education who serve as workforce development and occupational education resources for legislators and policymakers from various governmental agencies. NCOE also promotes innovative practices in community and technical colleges and tracks student achievement in these areas.Early in Dr. Donohue's tenure, she convened a strategic planning process which established five critical goals for NCOE for the years 1995-1997.The first goal is to transform education and training programs and structures to better prepare workers for the 21st century. The NCOE-produced monograph Workforce Development defines the need for national policy in this critical area and identifies strategies necessary for progress. NCOE provided copies of Workforce Development to congressional committees, Representatives, and Senators, for use in their important work on new education and workforce training legislation including efforts to streamline dozens of job training and education programs.The second goal emphasizes improving legislative relations by the organization. A National Policy Response Team was implemented for this purpose. Team members made monthly visits to agencies and legislators on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The team provided information to legislators and facilitated communication with practitioners. In addition, the policy response team provided quick responses to congressional and agency requests.The third goal is to collaborate in workforce preparation initiatives. Partnerships have been established with the National Council of Advanced Technology Centers. Network (a Department of Labor project), and the National Council on Community Service and Continuing Education [NCCSCE]. Monographs will be forthcoming from project partnerships with the League for Innovation and the National Center for Research on Vocational Education and also from the joint work with NCCSCE. The National Association for Manufacturing and the National Skill Standards Board are among other partners working with NCOE.The fourth goal established is to inaugurate a leadership development program. Regional training conferences will be established to implement this goal.The fifth goal is that of enhancing operating strategies for member services. In addition to improvements in the organization's newsletter, an Internet electronic Web page has been initiated to provide information and respond to questions.Dr. Donohue also serves on the Commission on Community and Workforce Development of the American Association of Community Colleges [AACC]. She is a coauthor of a Commission Monograph on the community college role in implementing reforms in workforce preparation proposed in Federal legislation.Again, congratulations and best wishes for continued success in your efforts with the National Council for Occupational Education as well as with St. Louis Community College.,2015-03-16 18:00:21.975738,2015-03-16 18:00:21.975738,Extensions,CONGRATULATIONS TO DR.

393,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, on two separate occasions this year I have made statements about the importance of education to our Nation and to this Congress. I've talked about what our parents want for their children, how to provide a good education, and how many of our current federal policies have failed to achieve what we want for our children.Today, as the Senator from Arkansas introduces his ``Dollars to the Classroom Act,'' which incorporates ingredients for educational success into our federal policy, I want to join in cosponsoring his bill as it will empower states and local school districts to spend federal resources in the best way they see fit. I also want to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of education.A Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall found that 88% of those surveyed think that improving the quality of public school education is ``very important.'' Now, I am not one to put a lot of emphasis on polls, but I think that this poll indicates what we already know: that making sure kids get a world-class education is a real priority for our nation. Moms and dads want their children to be in settings where they will be challenged to reach high levels of academic achievement, taught by qualified and caring teachers, and provided a safe learning environment.Obviously, parents want to be sure that schools are using the ingredients of success in education: parental involvement, local control, an emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance. It is interesting to note that a recent report of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives.Unfortunately, we are continuing to find that many of our current federal education programs, while well-intended, simply do not contain the ingredients of a successful education. Rather than promoting parental involvement, local control, and dollars going to the classroom, many federal programs promote a ``Washington-knows-best'' policy, in which federal bureaucrats decide exactly what education programs should be developed and exactly how every dollar should be spent. Not only are states, schools, teachers, and parents left without much say in how to educate their children, but they are also drained of time and energy complying with all the federal mandates handed down to them.Our current federal education laws bog states down in mountains of paperwork every year. Even though the U.S. Department of Education recently attempted to reduce paperwork burdens, the Department still requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork per year--or the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full-time. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications states must fill out to receive federal education funds each year.While the Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the smallest federal agencies with 4,637 people, state education agencies have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs (full-time equivalents) with federal dollars to administer the myriad federal programs. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally funded employees of state education agencies administering federal education programs as there are U.S. Department of Education employees.It is no wonder that up to 35% of our federal education dollar gets eaten up by bureaucratic and administrative costs. And we should remember this in the context of the fact that only about 7% of all education funding comes from the federal government. As we can see, this small amount of the entire education pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts must spend to administer education programs.I have also spoken in the past about the Ohio study finding that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of its total education funding. And I've also noted that in Florida it takes six times as many state employees to administer federal funds as it does to administer state dollars.Clearly, federal rules and regulations eat up precious dollars and teacher time. We must find a way to change this.I have also highlighted that the problem that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars paid by their parents for education because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. Local schools must come to Washington and plead their case to get back the money the parents of their communities sent to the federal treasury. Who suffers the most from this system? Smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer to get their fair share of the federal dollar.It is also interesting to note that, according to the Department of Education's own estimates, it takes 216 steps and 20 weeks to complete the review process for a federal discretionary education grant. The Department boasts that this is actually a streamlined process, since it used to take 26 weeks and took 487 steps from start to finish!I have talked about a third problem with many current federal education programs: dollars are earmarked for one and only one purpose, to the exclusion of all other uses. And many times, the distant Washington bureaucrats are designating funds for something that a school district doesn't even need at the time.I like to use an analogy to explain this problem. If you feel a headache coming on, would you rather be treated by a doctor one mile away from where you live, or a thousand miles away? And if you have to use the doctor a thousand miles away, how good is he or she going to be at prescribing what you need for your headache? It sure would be nicer to see someone close by who could take a look at you in person and make a proper diagnosis.And what if, when you tell the doctor a thousand miles away that you have a headache, she says to you, ``Oh, that's too bad. But today we're running a special on crutches. We are prescribing crutches for people like you all over the country, because we've heard that you may need them.'' You say, ``That's fine, but how is a crutch going to help my headache? Can't I get the money to buy some aspirin?'' And the doctor says, ``Sorry, but you can only use this money for crutches, not for aspirin, or anything else.''This is exactly what happens with so many of these categorical programs mandated from the federal level. Your local school district has determined that it needs funding for one thing, but the federal government will only release it for another. As a result, schools don't have the flexibility to use their funding for what they know they need to provide the best education possible for their students.For all the federal programs and dollars committed to education, are we seeing success? I'm afraid not.I have heard of a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which noted that even though the United States dedicates one of the largest shares of gross domestic product to education, it has fallen behind other economic powers in high school graduation rates. Only 72 percent of 18-year-old Americans graduated in 1996, trailing all other developed countries.Our Congressional Research Service has explained why current federal aid programs may not lead to educational improvement. They note that these programs have generally been focused on specific student population groups with special needs, priority subject areas, or specific educational concepts or techniques. CRS reports:While such ``categorical'' program structures assure that aid is directed to the priority population or purpose, they may not always be effective--instruction may become fragmented and poorly coordinated; the proliferation of programs may be duplicative; each federally assisted program may affect only a marginal portion of each pupil's instructional time that is poorly coordinated with the remainder of her or his instruction; regulations intended to target aid on particular areas of need may unintentionally limit local ability to engage in comprehensive reforms; or the partial segregation of special needs students, while it helps to guarantee that funds can be clearly associated with each program's intended beneficiaries, may also reinforce tendencies toward tracking pupils by achievement level, and unintentionally contribute to a perpetuation of lower expectations for their performance.I think the Congressional Research Service makes some valid observations about why our current federal education policy is not generally boosting student achievement and making our children competitive with other nations. CRS says that current federal policy hinders an important element of educational success: local control.Based upon what we know about the state of our current federal education policy, we must explore how to direct our resources in ways that will stimulate academic success and high achievement. States, school districts, school boards, teachers, and of course, parents, are asking for local control and flexibility to spend federal education dollars in ways they know will work. They know how to incorporate the ingredients of success into the education of their children.Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will give states and local schools the flexibility that they desperately need. His legislation takes nearly $3.5 billion from a number of federal education programs, directs the money to the states based upon student population, and requires that at least 95% of it is spent in our children's classrooms. Local school districts may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement.Under the ``Dollars to Classroom Act,'' parents, teachers, school boards and administrators will have the freedom to use federal dollars for what they need: whether it be to hire more teachers, raise teacher salaries, strengthen reading programs, buy new computers, or provide more one-on-one tutoring.The bill ensures that federal bureaucracy will be held at bay by forbidding the Secretary of Education from issuing any regulations regarding the type of classroom activities or services that school districts may choose to provide with the federal dollars. Finally, the ``Dollars to Classroom Act'' calls for ways to streamline regulations and eliminate bureaucracy within major federal education laws.Mr. President, we need to ensure that more federal education money is sent to the classroom, and that states, schools, and parents have more flexibility in using those funds in the way that will best help students achieve their fullest potential. We must find ways to encourage states and local schools to be innovative and creative in finding the most successful ways to challenge our students to the highest levels and achievement. Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will help accomplish these goals, and that is why I am pleased to co-sponsor his legislation.During the coming months, Congress should continue to evaluate our current federal elementary and secondary education programs and make the necessary changes to incorporate the ingredients we know have proven successful in providing the best education possible for our children. We cannot afford to maintain the status quo if it is not working. We owe it to our next generation to provide them what they need to be successful in the 21st Century. ,2015-03-16 18:00:22.142828,2015-03-16 18:00:22.142828,Senate,PESTICIDE HARMONIZATION WITH CANADA,1999-02-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-02-09/html/CREC-1999-02-09-pt1-PgS1393.htm,23,9,145,S1393-S1399,A000356,mr. ashcroft
394,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Madam Chairman, let me begin by thanking the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for working together in a true bipartisan fashion to begin providing a long overdue down payment to special education funding. In particular, I want to thank Ranking Member Walsh for his amendment in committee to provide a $335 million increase in special education funding for fiscal year 2008.When the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was signed into law more than 30 years ago, the Federal Government committed to pay the States 40 percent of the costs of providing services to students covered under this act. However, for three decades the Federal Government has often provided less than half the money promised.What has this shortfall meant? For one, it has meant higher taxes at the State and local levels and less funding for other education programs as States and local governments struggle to make up the shortfall in Federal resources.The amendment I introduce today builds on the bipartisan cooperation of the House Appropriations Committee by providing a further $125 million increase in funding for IDEA part B grants to the States. To pay for my amendment, I offset the cost by reducing a portion of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. My amendment helps us fulfill our commitment to funding special education while also providing a small increase in funding to the Global Fund as was provided last year. I don't take this money from any domestic program. These funds are dedicated to an overseas program, and they still see a $1 million increase over last year.My amendment sets the right priorities for our Nation's children with special needs, and I urge support from all of my colleagues. Again, I would thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on this.Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:00:22.309948,2015-03-16 18:00:22.309948,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008,2007-07-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-07-18/html/CREC-2007-07-18-pt1-PgH8000-3.htm,115,3,153,H8000-H8036,G000546,mr. graves
395,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time to close, as we have no further speakers.I would say to the gentleman and others, my friends, and I consider them my friends, many of whom are on the committee, I certainly hope that this interest in fiscal discipline remains as we really grapple with these appropriations bills, the challenge that remains ahead of us over the next weeks.Mr. Speaker, the idea is that we want to encourage families to put aside money for their children's education expenses. It was good policy a year ago. It is not good politics, it is just good policy to help those children achieve the American dream. Everybody has talked about their children. My daughter, who is almost 3, one on the way in December, and as we think of providing the best education possible for all of our children, is it not prudent to put aside that money at the earliest possible time, certainly as we see the cost of tuition continue to go up?If Congress fails to act, Mr. Speaker, here are the provisions that we will lose come January 1 of 2011. Instead of the annual contribution limit to an education account being $2,000 a year, it would revert to $500. Instead of expanding these education account benefits to all kids who go to any type of school, we would be simply focused on those of college education and forgetting about those educational expenses for special needs kids or educational expenses for those in kindergarten through elementary school and secondary education.My friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), talked about section 529 plans. The reason we need to make these tax incentives permanent is as we invest into a prepaid tuition plan or section 529 plan, the thrust of that is that those withdrawals that we make in those years that those kids, I say to the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra), that are not college age yet, when they reach college age, if we fail to act, those distributions out of those section 529 plans are going to be taxable and not tax-free. That is certainly a good policy reason why we need to act today to make these incentives long-term.Prepaid tuition plans. Again, as the gentleman from Michigan talked about, he has been a champion of tax-free employer-provided education assistance, not just for graduate education but for undergraduate education, again, trying to provide and enlist as many opportunities for individuals in this country of all ages to better themselves through more education.And certainly the student-interest loan deduction, again, if we fail to act, we will once again put limits on the amount of interest that can be deducted on those burdensome student loans if we fail to act.Again, Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting debate. I would just simply say that if it was good policy as we debated this and voted on it as the House and the President signed it into law 1 year ago, it remains good policy today. We need to provide permanent relief to families who want to help their children achieve the American dream.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of making education more affordable and accessible to our nation's students. HR 5203, however, does not actually benefit the majority of students and families.Education savings accounts were established in 1997 as a tool for families to save money over a period of years for their children's higher education. Congress recognized the growing cost of college and the increasing difficulty families face trying to pay for college, and created these accounts to encourage early savings. Last year's tax cut legislation increased the contribution limit for education savings accounts from $500 to $2,000 and expanded the definition of qualified education expenses that can be paid from an education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary school expenses for public, private, or religious schools.While I support making education more affordable, HR 5203 will allow parents to use these statutorily created education savings accounts--tax free--for almost ANY aspect they consider relevant to their child's education, at any school from kindergarten through college.If parents feel they need a new sport utility vehicle to drive their kids to school; That is OK.If they need a new microwave oven to prepare breakfast for their kids before school; That is OK.If I want to use these funds, tax free, to pay my older son Johnny to tutor my younger son Matthew on the ABCs; That is OK.Mr. Speaker, these examples seem silly for good reason; this bill does nothing to help families or to teach children. We need to focus our national attention on helping needy families, fixing ailing public schools, and leveraging community investment to help parents, teachers and administrators meet the important educational challenges they face in serving the vast majority of our children. In addition, we need to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) passed last year.Our Public schools currently serve approximately 90 percent of students in grades K-12 and face record-breaking enrollments. The NCLB gave parents the choice to transfer their kids from a failing public school to non-failing public school. Recent reports show, however, that very few students are actually able to benefit from this because our schools cannot accommodate any additional children. We should act smarter to devote scarce federal dollars to ensure that all our children receive the education they deserve.Finally, the bill is fiscally irresponsible. Last year's tax cut bill halted our progress in reducing the national debt. Virtually all the projected surpluses that were used to justify last year's bill have now disappeared. Furthermore, enactment of the bill being considered today would further increase the budget deficit that already is occurring as a result of last year's bill.I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing the underlying bill. This is not the time to be considering a tax cut that our country cannot afford when there is no assurance that the money will truly benefit all families equally.,2015-03-16 18:00:22.465063,2015-03-16 18:00:22.465063,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE PERMANENCE ACT OF 2002,2002-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-09-04/html/CREC-2002-09-04-pt1-PgH6022.htm,110,32,148,H6022-H6028,H000948,mr. hulshof
396,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) for yielding.Mr. Speaker, like others today, I am here to recognize the tremendous contribution that Congressman Goodling has made to this Congress, to this country, and particularly to education.Bill Goodling spent his entire career with a focus on education. As a teacher, as a coach, as a guidance counselor, as a school administrator, and when he was elected to Congress by the people from the 19th district in Pennsylvania, he chose to go on the committee that focused on education.He became the chairman of that committee. He has been a tireless advocate for making public schools better through real reform. He has pursued full funding of IDEA, understanding that the Federal Government needs to first of all keep its word.As a former college president, I particularly appreciate all the chairman has done to substantially increase the Pell Grant funding. And during his leadership of that committee, Pell Grant funding has increased in a way that it has never increased before.There are really too many accomplishments to talk about all of them, certainly the signature piece of legislation, the William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. This legislation gives more flexibility to school districts as they try to meet the needs of children, as they try to do what is best for the children of America.On behalf of America's students, on behalf of America's educators, as the cochairman of the Education Caucus here in the Congress, I just want to thank the chairman for his outstanding record of public service, for his commitment to education, for his great work for the people of Pennsylvania.,2015-03-16 18:00:22.620173,2015-03-16 18:00:22.620173,House,TRIBUTE TO CHAIRMAN GOODLING OF THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE,2000-10-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-03/html/CREC-2000-10-03-pt1-PgH8624.htm,121,2,146,H8624,B000575,mr. blunt
397,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the Moran substitute. I support it because it eliminates many of the harmful riders that the majority has added to the D.C. appropriations bill, including the $7 million to fund tuition vouchers for district students.It is appalling that the majority would blackmail the citizens of this great city into accepting a congressional mandated school voucher program that the District voters overwhelmingly rejected, and is opposed by District school officials.This voucher plan is seriously flawed. First, it does nothing for 97 percent of the District students who would not receive a voucher. We should be helping all 78,000 of the district's children, not draining taxpayer dollars from the public schools for just a lucky few that may benefit from a voucher program. Further, the amount of the voucher would not even pay entry into many private schools, and many of those that would be affordable have limited slots and barriers to admission.The real Republican agenda is to undermine public support for public education, and ultimately close down our neighborhood schools. We saw the real Republican agenda in action when they tried and failed to abolish the Department of Education, attempted to block grant education programs, and worked to slash Federal funding for education. Now, desperate to advance their right wing agenda, they are looking to drain taxpayer dollars out of public schools and into private and religious schools.I call on the majority to stop playing politics with our public schools and join with Democrats to invest more in early childhood education, give relief of our crumbling and overcrowded schools, give Federal support for local school renewal plans, and ensure that we have well-trained teachers.I urge support for this substitute.,2015-03-16 18:00:22.775306,2015-03-16 18:00:22.775306,House,Announcement by the Chairman Pro Tempore,1997-10-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-10-09/html/CREC-1997-10-09-pt1-PgH8796.htm,140,43,143,H8796-H8806,C000488,mr. clay
398,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell the gentleman from Iowa, if he is still present, that I would have objected if the provision he wants had been in this bill.I, for one, do not agree with the welfare bill that was tried to be passed, that could not come out of the Committee on Agriculture. They stuck it on the reconciliation package, which the President rightfully vetoed. It is nothing but a welfare bill for big farmers. Farmers get $120,000 a year and do not even have to farm under that bill.Mr. Speaker, I did not want to talk about it, but the gentleman brought it up. What I really wanted to talk about is I want the people to know that this bill really is one that I am going to vote for because I see the need for it, but I am going to hold my nose real good when I vote for it, because it smells, it stinks for what it does to education. It is terrible for education.I want to tell everybody that if you think this is bad for education, which my educators say is bad for education, then if the President had signed their reconciliation package, which they called the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, they would have seen the same cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and everything down the line, just like they are cutting education in this. This is a terrible bill, but it is the only thing we have. That is the only reason I am going to be voting for it. It smells to high heaven. It cuts education.It means a lot of my students that are in higher education next year are going to have a tough time returning. It means that a lot of kids going out of high school this year are going to have a terrible time being able to get that education next year. It means that many of my elementary and secondary institutions, schools in my district, are not going to be able to have the funds that they need that they have had in the past for necessary programs under title I. I think this should be corrected. That is why I am going to strongly support the motion to recommit.I ask anybody that is really interested in education to support that motion. I will return now to agriculture and tell again the gentleman from Iowa, yes, I have been told, I will tell you how it goes up here, folks.That bill was not reported out of the Committee on Agriculture because it was a smelly bill, a terrible bill, so they stuck it in the reconciliation.Now they tell me, I just got word today, that next week on Tuesday we are supposed to bring it up in committee and mark it up, a different bill. I just got a copy of it today, but now my staff tells me this evening that this is not the bill we are going to mark up, we are going to have a different one, we are going to have the chairman's mark when we do it, and I will not see that until Tuesday.That is the way they work down here.

399,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Steve Lukens, Assistant Principal at R.O. Hawkins Junior High School in Jackson, Missouri. Recently, Mr. Lukens announced his retirement after 31 years of distinguished service in Missouri's Public Schools.Mr. Lukens was born on June 23, 1947, to Harry and Ella Lukens in St. Louis, Missouri. Upon graduation from high school he joined the U.S. Navy and served as an air traffic controller from 1967 until 1972. After his honorable discharge, Mr. Lukens pursued a degree in education from Southeast Missouri State University, which is also where he met his future wife, Ellen. Upon graduation from the Southeast Missouri State, he commenced what would be a long and laudable career in education.Mr. Lukens has dedicated his life to public education over the past 31 years. He embarked on his teaching career in the Cape Girardeau, Missouri, public school system, where he served as a language arts teacher for 21 years. Throughout his time in the Cape Girardeau Public Schools, he served in several capacities for many extracurricular activities, including sponsor of the Red Dagger Club and set director for theatric productions. In order to play an active role in the lives of even more students, Mr. Lukens pursued a position in school administration.In 1996, Mr. Lukens accepted a position as Assistant Principal at R.O. Hawkins Junior High School and has served the school in this capacity for the past ten years. During his tenure, Mr. Lukens has overseen several massive construction projects to the school, a growing student population, and the everyday challenges associated with the instruction of adolescents. As the faces change every year in the halls of R.O. Hawkins Junior High, Mr. Lukens' dedication to education and cultivating the leaders of tomorrow remains a constant. To the students of R.O. Hawkins Junior High, Mr. Lukens is more than just a school administrator, he is a friend and mentor.Although Mr. Lukens has led an exemplary career in education, it would not have been possible without the love and support of his family. Mr. Lukens' wonderful wife, Ellen, and two loving children, Jennie and Laura, undoubtedly enhanced his ability to change the lives of area youth. As I commend Mr. Lukens, I also recognize the efforts of his family to further his career. I once again congratulate Mr. Lukens on a successful career in education and wish him well in all his future endeavors.,2015-03-16 18:00:23.143540,2015-03-16 18:00:23.143540,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO STEVE LUKENS,2006-04-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-04-26/html/CREC-2006-04-26-pt1-PgE605-2.htm,47,0,152,E605,E000172,mrs. emerson
400,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of Fort Osage as a landmark identified and later developed by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the voyage of the Corps of Discovery.In June of 1804, the Corps of Discovery passed a high bluff on the Missouri River--which would later become Fort Osage in Jackson County, Missouri. Only four years later, Clark returned to initiate construction on a Fort and trading-house under the direction of the War Department. Clark noted ``The River could be completely defended'' and he deemed the ``situation elegant.''Fort Osage (or Fort Clark as it was originally named) played an important role in the exploration and development of the West. Goods were traded with the Osage, Ayauway and Kansas tribes at this site for years to come. Fort Osage proved to be the single most profitable trading post of its kind in the United States and the territories. We are indebted to the legacy of the Fort and the people who lived, worked and defended the Fort. Their courage had a profound effect on the evolution of our nation.As part of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration, Jackson County Parks and Recreation is proposing an innovative education center. The education center would showcase artifacts and exhibit the significance of the Missouri River. I believe this education center is a wonderful addition to the commemoration and will help visitors understand the significance of Fort Osage. It is the only site along the trail where Clark returned to develop a facility that fulfilled the goals of President Thomas Jefferson's dream of commerce and development with the west. The significance of Fort Osage is not limited to Lewis and Clark. Both the Yellowstone Expedition and the Long Expedition visited the Fort in 1819. The Long Expedition brought the first steamboat, Western Engineer. Only years later, William Becknell arrived at Fort Osage, using the site as mile marker ``0'' for the Santa Fe trail, again distinguishing the importance of the Fort in relation to commerce in the west.Due to the area's historical significance, the Fort Osage Education Center was proposed as part of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration. The Education Center was recently recognized by the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission as the priority project in Missouri and I am honored to have this historical site in my district. I look forward to the events surrounding the bicentennial commemoration at Fort Osage and in other areas of the 6th District of Missouri. I join the Missouri Bicentennial Commission, the Missouri Department of Conservation and the United States Geological Survey in full support of the proposed Fort Osage Education Center.,2015-03-16 18:00:23.299651,2015-03-16 18:00:23.299651,Extensions,FORT OSAGE,2001-05-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-08/html/CREC-2001-05-08-pt1-PgE751-5.htm,62,0,147,E751-E752,G000546,mr. graves
401,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that a long and exceptional career in education is nearing an end. Dr. Tom F. Luthy, Jr., of Lebanon, Missouri, is retiring after more than 40 years of service to Lebanon Public Schools.Tom began his teaching career as an 18-year-old college student in 1958 at the Blackfoot School. After that, he taught grades five through eight for two years at the two-room Bolles School before teaching for two years at the Lebanon High School. After a year of teaching at the newly built Glendale High School in Springfield, Tom returned to Lebanon as the school's firstever department chair in charge of the social studies program. He continued to teach history for 15 more years at the high school.When the high school moved to its present location in 1976, Tom stayed as the assistant principal of Lebanon Junior High. Two years later, he became the principal and spent the next 17 years guiding the lives of the young people who attended his school. After that, he became the Lebanon R-111 Schools assistant superintendent for personnel and instruction. As an assistant superintendent for the past eight years, Tom has hired more teachers than are currently on the entire district staff. He also guided the district through its highly successful review under the Missouri School Improvement Plan in 1998.Tom has had a great impact on education in the Lebanon area. Early in his career, he created the American Heritage program at the high school. He also was involved in the formation of the C-5 school and was instrumental in naming that school after Joel E. Barber, who was president of the school board at the Blackfoot School where he began his career. After retirement, Tom will still impact education by continuing his work with the statewide Goals 2000 project, which is developing a new physical education model for Missouri.Mr. Speaker, Tom Luthy's passion for excellence in education has made a difference in the lives of students and teachers. I know all Members of Congress will join me in paying tribute to his outstanding service to the Lebanon education community.,2015-03-16 18:05:59.503657,2015-03-16 18:05:59.503657,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RETIRING ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT DR.

402,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is offered by those who apparently have no interest in producing a bipartisan Labor-HHS appropriations bill. It is a sad and ironic commentary that many of those who now claim they support additional funding for vocational education are the same people who want to eliminate the Department of Education and the Federal role in education altogether. It should come as no surprise that these born-again devotees of vocational education choose worker health and safety protection as their sacrificial lamb. After all, many of the supporters of this amendment tried in vain last year to pass legislation to gut the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Since they failed to decapitate OSHA with a single blow of the axe, they now apparently have decided to try to kill OSHA cut by cut, dollar by dollar.Mr. Chairman, I will match my support of vocational education against that of any other Member of this House. But I will not support this insulting effort to pit worker safety against vocational education. Seventeen workers are killed on the job every day in this country. A recent comprehensive study of occupational injury and illness found that workplace illnesses and injuries cost this country at least $171 billion a year. Yet, OSHA has only enough inspectors to inspect each workplace for which it is responsible once every 167 years. Six thousand five hundred workers die every year as a result of occupational injuries. Sixty thousand more workers are killed every year as a result of occupational illnesses. The cost of AIDS, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular diseases are less than the cost of occupational death and illness.Mr. Chairman, since 1970 the job fatality rate in this country has been cut in half; since passage of OSHA, at least 140,000 lives have been saved. But we can do better. Let me remind the sponsor of this amendment, my colleague, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Blunt] that 125 workers in the State of Missouri were killed in workplace accidents in 1995. Another 170,000 Missouri workers were injured on the job. There was only enough money to employ 37 OSHA inspectors for our State, and it would take these inspectors 339 years to inspect each workplace one time.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not in the best interests of the health and safety of Missouri workers, as well as millions of other workers across this Nation. I urge defeat of the amendment.,2015-03-16 18:05:59.730791,2015-03-16 18:05:59.730791,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-08/html/CREC-1997-09-08-pt1-PgH6977-5.htm,117,24,143,H6977-H6999,C000488,mr. clay
403,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, it's a great revelation to see that our colleagues on your side of the aisle have come to realize the importance of increased support for student aid programs which assist low income students. I am especially pleased that, after numerous efforts to slash funding for education programs, Republicans now see the light. My hope is that they will continue moving in that direction and realize that increased funding for education across the board is essential to increase educational opportunities.Mr. Speaker, I support a substantial increase for Pell funding. In fact, in the last Congress I introduced legislation to make Pell Grant funding mandatory spending, just like the loan programs.However, I am concerned that the way H. Con. Res. 88 is written, could be interpreted to pit one group of education programs against another. If adopted and adhered to by the appropriators, it would rob Peter to pay Paul.The record of House Democrats' support for increased aid to needy college students is clear. House Democrats have been in the forefront in advocating increased funding for student aid programs without short-changing or reducing spending for other programs. Since 1996, Democrats, in conjunction with the President, have been responsible for adding nearly $8 billion more for education than was in bills supported by House Republicans. With respect to Pell Grants, since 1996 the President requested, and House Democrats supported, an increase of $3.4 billion, while House Republicans advocated 62% less.Today, we are being asked to vote for a resolution that would aid freshmen at the expense of first graders. We believe that is an unwise, inappropriate choice.During the committee markup my colleagues and I offered amendments to H. Con. Res. 88 designed to increase Pell Grants without jeopardizing other worthy programs. The language we offered was the same language adopted in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. The Senate resolution calls for increased Pell Grants, without pitting one education program against another. Unfortunately, we are not successful in these efforts.We should go on record for increasing our overall investment in education, instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul.,2015-03-16 18:05:59.882926,2015-03-16 18:05:59.882926,House,URGING CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PELL GRANTS,1999-05-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-04/html/CREC-1999-05-04-pt1-PgH2570-2.htm,63,34,145,H2570-H2577,C000488,mr. clay
404,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,"Mr. President, today I congratulate Dr. Henry 
Givens, Jr. on his retirement and to thank him for his many years of 
leadership and service to the field of education. For over 50 years, 
Dr. Givens has been a champion of higher education and has fought to 
improve the lives of Missouri's students. It is my pleasure to honor 
him today.A native of St. Louis, MO, Dr. Givens attended public schools and 
received his bachelor's degree from Lincoln University, a master's 
degree from the University of Illinois, and his doctorate degree from 
Saint Louis University. Dr. Givens began his career in education as a 
fifth and sixth grade teacher in the Webster Groves School District in 
suburban St. Louis. After his work with the Webster Groves School 
District, Dr. Givens became the principal of the first prototype magnet 
school, Douglas Elementary School in St. Louis, MO. Under Dr. Given's 
guidance, Douglas Elementary faculty debuted revolutionary teaching 
techniques that are now standard classroom practices, helping to 
modernize Missouri's school systems.In 1973, Dr. Givens continued to break new ground when he became the 
first African-American assistant commissioner of education for the 
State of 
Missouri. Dr. Givens spent 5 years in that position before becoming 
president of Harris-Stowe University in 1979. When he first assumed 
leadership, Harris-Stowe State College offered one degree--elementary 
education--and had only one building. During Dr. Givens' 32 years as 
president of Harris-Stowe, the university expanded and upgraded 
facilities, tripled student population, and added 13 new degree 
programs. Dr. Givens' determined leadership shaped Harris-Stowe into 
the outstanding university it is today.In addition to his accomplishments in the field of education, Dr. 
Givens is affiliated with numerous national and local professional and 
social organizations and has received over 125 awards and recognitions 
for his service to his community. President Obama recently appointed 
Dr. Givens to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital 
Finance Advisory Board, and Dr. Givens has served as the chairman of 
the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Statewide Celebration Commission for 
Missouri since its inception in 1986.It is my pleasure to honor Dr. Givens today. His dedicated leadership 
has improved the quality of the educational experience for Missourians. 
He has undoubtedly touched the lives of many and improved the quality 
of the community at large.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and 
honoring Dr. Henry Givens, Jr. ",2015-03-16 18:06:00.027007,2015-03-16 18:06:00.027007,Senate,TRIBUTE TO DR. HENRY GIVENS JR.,2011-11-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-11-01/html/CREC-2011-11-01-pt1-PgS7001-2.htm,165,0,157,S7001-S7002,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
405,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam President, I wish to honor Mrs. Jackie McKinsey of Springfield, MO, for her dedication and service to the Ozarks Technical Community College, locally known as OTC. Twenty-four years ago, McKinsey became a founding member of the board of trustees as the school began operations. McKinsey has been a guiding force in OTC's evolution into the dynamic school it is today, providing a wide range of technical, highly sophisticated curricula for post-secondary education for more than 14,000 students. Since 1990, OTC has transitioned into a modern campus with a series of new facilities in Springfield and the construction of a second campus with three additional education centers.McKinsey led the search committee that resulted in the hiring of the current school president, Dr. Hal Higdon, in 2006. She has served in every office on the board of trustees, including chairperson, and has been a tireless advocate for community colleges in Missouri.In fact, Jackie McKinsey has dedicated her life to activism in education. For 12 years she was a member of the Springfield School Board and spent 2 years on the Missouri School Board Association. She also served on the Missouri Special Education Advisory Board for 20 years. In 1996, she was appointed by the Governor to the Missouri Women's Council. Mrs. McKinsey is an experienced mediator and has served as a trained hearing officer in cases between parents of special education students and schools districts.Jackie McKinsey announced her retirement last summer, and the board of trustees honored her with the title of trustee emeritus. McKinsey is the fifth individual to receive this honor, joining other founding trustees Dolores Brooks, Don Clinkenbeard, Frank Farmer, and Don Wessel. This team of Springfieldians gave OTC the steady direction to be a successful open admission, 2-year college dedicated to technical education. Offering students the opportunity to earn a 1-year certificate, a 2-year associate of applied science degree, A.A.S., or an associate of arts degree, A.A., OTC is now widely praised for its professional faculty and diverse curriculum. I wish Jackie McKinsey all the best in this next chapter.Jackie McKinsey has played a major role in that success, and her legacy will continue to impact future generations through the foundations she help put in place at OTC. I wish her the best in her well-deserved retirement. ,2015-03-16 18:06:00.182111,2015-03-16 18:06:00.182111,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2014-09-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-09-11/html/CREC-2014-09-11-pt1-PgS5556.htm,130,0,160,S5556,B000575,mr. blunt
406,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the first National Jazz Appreciation Month and the importance of music and arts education to America's youth. Jazz Appreciation Month (JAM) is intended to draw the public's attention to the glories of jazz as both a historical and a living treasure by encouraging public and private partnerships focused on arts education. A joint initiative of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Department of Education, the National Association for Music Education, the International Association of Jazz Educators, and the U.S. Department of State, Jazz Appreciation Month will encourage special programs on jazz every April. The Smithsonian's National Museum of National History began to organize Jazz Appreciation Month in 1997 with a presentation to the International Association of Jazz Educators. Modeled after Black History Month, Jazz Appreciation Month is a global celebration of jazz, with events scheduled from Kansas City to Cleveland to South Africa.Known as the mother of swing and the nurturer of Bebop, my district of Kansas City, Missouri is the birthplace of Charlie ``Bird'' Parker, the great alto saxophonist. Because of ``Bird's'' influence, jazz has been a cornerstone of Kansas City culture since the 1930s. A proud reflection of my district's dynamic musical heritage is the American Jazz Museum at 18th and Vine, which tells the story of jazz and its greatest performers through the sights and sounds of the movement. Tomorrow, I will attend an installation ceremony at the American Jazz Museum to dedicate ``Jazz Pantheon,'' a commissioned sculpture by John T. Scott. This project was funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the One-Percent-For-All Program by the City of Kansas City. This sculpture is part of the ongoing revitalization of the historic district of 18th and Vine and manifests the central role of jazz to the metropolitan Kansas City area.In conjunction with Jazz Appreciation Month, the American Jazz Museum has organized two music educational events in my district. On April 25th, middle school students will be celebrating the culmination of this year's Duke Ellington Youth Project. This interdisciplinary program, which combines music, literature, and history will culminate with a music performance and arts exhibition celebrating the history of jazz and will include a reception at the American Jazz Museum for the participants and their families.Jazz Storytelling is a second music educational program organized by the American Jazz Museum. It combines stories about jazz with live instrumental music for children between the ages of three and nine. A unique aspect of the Jazz Storytelling program is the Living Legends Series, which features Kansas City's own jazz legends, such as Myra Taylor, Luqman Hamza, Geneva Price, Eddie Saunders, and Ahmad Alaadlen, who share their amazing stories and the musical magic that made them great.These programs organized by the American Jazz Museum are two of the arts and music education programs in the metropolitan Kansas City area. Jazz Appreciation events are scheduled throughout the country during the month of April. On April 16 in Los Angeles, the Recording Academy screened the recently restored concert film footage of Louis Armstrong in Prague, Dave Brubeck in Australia and the Bud Powell Trio in France. These films were restored as part of the GRAMMY Foundation's Music on Film Preservation Project, which is an ongoing effort to preserve America's music and film heritage. The National Museum of American History will spotlight the history and music of jazz through events such as a Tribute to Ella Fitzgerald by the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra and a public viewing of Louis Armstrong's first horn that he learned to play on while incarcerated as a youngster in New Orleans.The importance of arts and music education to America's youth should not be underestimated. Affording children access to the arts through education yields great dividends to our society. The U.S. Department of Justice found that arts education reduced delinquency in San Antonio by 13%, increased communication skills of Atlanta students by 57%, and improved cooperation skills of Portland youth by 57%. In addition, the College Board has shown that college bound students who are involved in the arts have higher overall SAT scores than other students. Jazz Appreciation Month should serve as a reminder that we should appropriate additional resources for music and arts education programs, as it is America's children who will reap the benefits.Last week, I was privileged to meet Lionel Hampton, one of the living legends of jazz. I am a proud cosponsor of the resolution passed by the House celebrating Lionel Hampton on his 94th birthday. I would like to personally congratulate Lionel on his birthday, and thank him for his dedication to music education. Lionel Hampton is at the forefront of music education, delineated by the naming of the Lionel Hampton School of Music at the University of Idaho, the first school of music named for a jazz musician. Mr. Hampton's devotion to teaching is evident from the thousands of students who have learned from him and the visiting jazz artists, scholars, and educators he has brought to the school. In addition to being a jazz legend and music educator, Lionel Hampton has a strong correlation to Jazz Appreciation Month, as he is one of the many leading figures in jazz who celebrate their birthday during April.Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month and the ongoing arts and music education events at the American Jazz Museum at 18th and Vine in Kansas City, Congress should commit federal resources to the provision of arts and music education programs for our youth all over America.,2015-03-16 18:06:00.337249,2015-03-16 18:06:00.337249,Extensions,JAZZ APPRECIATION MONTH,2002-04-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-26/html/CREC-2002-04-26-pt1-PgE641-3.htm,49,0,148,E641-E642,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
407,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, on many occasions, I have come to the Senate floor to talk about the importance of parental control and involvement in a child's education. Study after study has confirmed that parental involvement is the single most important element in educational achievement.One way to allow parents more control over and involvement in their children's education is to give them more choices of where to send their children to school. Choice empowers parents. It puts them in the driver's seat instead of the nickel seats. I believe we want parents in those front seats. Education is an important tool that our children need in order to survive and be successful in our society. It is sad to realize that for too many children in too many families, a safe, structured and challenging education is out of reach. The public schools in many of our major cities simply cannot or do not provide adequate education, while a private or parochial education is too costly for most families of modest means.On the other hand, it is encouraging when individuals in our society step forward to provide the means for better educational opportunities for our nation's underprivileged children. When those in the private sector, through their charitable giving, open the door for kids to receive a high quality education, those individuals are to be commended.I am pleased to say that last week, two very generous and compassionate Americans gave new hope to thousands of families across the country who want the same thing all of us want--the best possible education for their children.Ted Forstmann and John Walton are businessmen, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. On June 9, they launched the Children's Scholarship Fund, which will provide scholarships to bright and deserving children from low-income families across the nation to help their parents send them to any private or parochial school they're academically qualified to attend--from kindergarten right through high school. Thanks to these individuals, new educational opportunities will now be available to thousands of youngsters that were not available before.These two civic-minded Americans have given the fund quite a start, with an initial contribution of $100 million dollars. Over the summer, they will select cities to become partners with the fund, lining up donors in each city to match their initial generosity. That will allow this new and exciting program to distribute more than $200 million in scholarships in more than a dozen cities, with each scholarship being an opportunity for a child to prepare for a better and brighter future.This national program is modeled after--and really inspired by--an effort Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton launched here in the city of Washington, D.C. earlier this year. Together they donated $6 million to the Washington Scholarship Fund, which recently awarded scholarships to more than 1,000 students from the troubled District of Columbia public schools. Washington is one of about thirty privately-funded scholarship programs in the country. The fact that there are so many of these programs speaks volumes, I think, about the state of the public schools in many of our cities.I mention the Washington program because I think it's a good example of what the national effort is all about. First, the Washington Scholarship Fund is locally-based and locally-run. Mr. Forstmann is right when he insists that each program must have strong involvement from local officials, community leaders, local businesses and anyone else who wants to help kids obtain the best education. I have always believed that local neighborhoods and communities are in the best position to create solutions to meet the specific needs of individuals in their communities.The Children's Scholarship Fund is already in contact with more than 300 mayors from all around the country. This is the first step in selecting partners who know what's needed in their community and who will support this program financially and with their hard work.But perhaps more important than the scholarships themselves is what they represent. it's important--and maybe even a bit sad--to note that more than seventy-five hundred families here in the Nation's Capitol applied for those 1,000 scholarships. It took a lottery to give them out. Mr. Forstmann has said he never dreamed the demand would be so overwhelming.Who are these families? They're families whose children are trapped in public school systems that offer them no choices. If students only have one choice of where to attend school, they are locked into that school and don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere.On the other hand, when students have more choices of where to attend school, they will have the ability to receive a higher quality, more rigorous education. The Children's Scholarship Fund provides children and their families with more educational choice.I believe that providing more educational choices for families can even help our nation's public schools, because they will understand they are no longer the exclusive provider of education in their community. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what it is that students need. When you have diversity and pluralism in a school system by providing more choices for students, this creates energy, creativity, and quality when institutions know that they have to do their best for to compete for students.I commend Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton for providing the opportunity for our nation's children to have greater choices of where to receive their education, giving them the chance to learn as much as their minds and hard work will allow.Education is an investment in future citizens, future leaders, the future work force of America. Ted Forstmann and John Walton have made a profound investment in the nation's future, one that is worthy of our admiration and gratitude.,2015-03-16 18:06:00.460309,2015-03-16 18:06:00.460309,Senate,CHILDREN'S SCHOLARSHIP FUND,1998-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-15/html/CREC-1998-06-15-pt1-PgS6327-4.htm,77,0,144,S6327-S6328,A000356,mr. ashcroft

412,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my colleagues to vote no on this rule and to give every child the first-rate public education that he or she deserves. I believe, and I think most Members believe, that education is the challenge of our time. And after the early promise of a bipartisan accord on education, before getting sidetracked by a partisan tax cut bill, we are on the floor with probably the first truly bipartisan effort of the Bush administration. I congratulate the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) and the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) on bringing this truly bipartisan bill to fruition.This, in our view, is real compromise. It is real bipartisan legislation. It is the product of two sides coming together for the sake of something larger. Democrats did not get everything that we wanted. Republicans did not get everything that they wanted. But both sides were able to forge agreement on more accountability, better-trained teachers, high-quality teachers, and after-school programs which we know make schools safer.That is why Democrats are deeply disappointed with the rule that the Republicans have put forward today. This rule prevents us from offering amendments that we believe are critical to an excellent public education in the Information Age. It squelches debate on the most important issue that we know, preventing us from bringing two key amendments; to modernize public schools and help get smaller class sizes for our children.Something clearly happened between the goodwill in committee and bringing this bill to the floor. Instead of building on what was an honest compromise in the committee, the Republican leadership has backed away from the promise of education reform and opening the door to reducing resources for after-school and other critical programs. It has opened the door to undoing school accountability, an issue where the President and all of us on the Democratic side agree. And it is revisiting the flawed voucher scheme that will not turn around failing schools, will leave children behind, and that Members of both parties have rejected.Now, we need to improve public education for children by building new schools and repairing school buildings, something that both Democrats and Republicans have proposed. By ensuring smaller class sizes, by hiring new teachers, by providing new resources, not less, we live up to the true promise of education reform that truly would leave no child behind.We believe with all our hearts that bipartisan amendments on building new schools, on repairing and refurbishing schools and allowing for smaller classroom size would command bipartisan majorities in this House today and next week when we take up this bill.We ask Members to turn down this rule and give us a rule that will yield a real, real bipartisan education bill for the American people.,2015-03-16 18:06:01.174823,2015-03-16 18:06:01.174823,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1, NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001,2001-05-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-17/html/CREC-2001-05-17-pt1-PgH2298-2.htm,68,35,147,H2298-H2310,G000132,mr. gephardt
413,MO,James,Talent,R,I rise today in strong support of the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago Congress made a promise to children and families with special education needs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. Under IDEA the Federal Government promised to provide children with disabilities access to quality public education, as well as to contribute 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure to assist state and local schools with the additional cost of educating these students. Mr. Speaker, to date the Federal Government has failed to meet this commitment to assist the states and local school districts.During the past four fiscal years the Republican majority in Congress has increased Federal funding for IDEA by 115 percent or $2.6 billion. Sadly, even with the increase, the Federal Government has never contributed more than 12.6 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure the assist children with disabilities. That is less than \1/3\ of the funding Congress promised under IDEA.The Congressional Research Service estimates that more than $15 billion would be needed to fully fund the Federal portion of IDEA. In fiscal year 2000 IDEA received $4.9 billion, leaving states and school districts with an unfunded mandate of more than $10 billion. This is $10 billion dollars that states and local school districts could have spent on smaller class size, school construction, new computer equipment, and hiring new teachers; instead this money is being spent to cover the Federal share of IDEA. What does that mean for the State of Missouri, Mr. Speaker? The additional funds needed to meet the commitment to the State of Missouri is over $161 million this year. What does that mean for St. Louis? The additional funds needed to meet the commitment to St. Louis is over $8 million this year.Mr. Speaker, it is essential that Congress fully fund IDEA and this legislation is a step in the right direction. This legislation authorizes an increase of $2 billion per year to meet the Federal commitment of 40 percent by the year 2010. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago the Federal Government placed a mandate on our state and local school districts to provide education for all special needs and disabled students. The Federal Government also promised to pay 40 percent of the average cost of the average per pupil expenditure. Today, there is a lot of talk about new education programs and new education initiatives but we still have yet to meet the Federal commitment to IDEA. IDEA is the mother of all unfunded mandates. Local schools are required by Federal law to meet the special education needs of our Nation's IDEA students. It is time that Congress gives our schools the resources that were promised to provide all children with disabilities a quality education.,2015-03-16 18:06:01.307912,2015-03-16 18:06:01.307912,House,IDEA FULL FUNDING ACT OF 2000,2000-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-03/html/CREC-2000-05-03-pt1-PgH2449-2.htm,53,51,146,H2449-H2457,T000024,mr. talent
414,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Yesterday was President Harry S. Truman's birthday. One of his quotes is particularly appropriate today. He said:The purpose of our society is to enable the individual to attain the highest achievement of which he is capable.The highest achievements that have sprung from our education system have included harnessing the atom, claiming the high ground in space, and curing previously fatal diseases. But now, because of our failure to adequately fund education, tuition is skyrocketing. Graduates who wish to reach for achievement are anchored to Earth by thousands of dollars in debt. For us to also allow interest rates to double on these student loans is morally unacceptable and economically foolish.To paraphrase President Truman: the extra bucks stop here. Let's stop the student loan interest rates from doubling July 1. Stop the political games. Let's support American students to attain their highest achievements.,2015-03-16 18:06:01.462022,2015-03-16 18:06:01.462022,House,STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES,2012-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-05-09/html/CREC-2012-05-09-pt1-PgH2457-11.htm,65,1,158,H2457-H2458,C001060,mr. carnahan
415,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.Mr. Speaker, tonight we look back nearly a half century to the 1954 case to Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka and the impact on this Nation.The Supreme Court took a bold step at that time to right the wrongs and correct years of injustice. The court stepped out of the box to do what was right. Even so, in Missouri the city of St. Louis and county schools continued to defy the high Court as a large segment of children continued to attend segregated schools and receive an inferior education. Regrettably, it took a local court case in the 1970s to desegregate St. Louis city and county public schools.On a personal note, my family was subjected to the sordid history of segregated schools. My grandmother, Luella Hyatt, was born in suburban Black Jack, Missouri, in the early 1900s and was denied access to schools there. She was forced to move to St. Louis City to attend school with other African Americans.Segregated schools were tragic and the ramifications of children receiving an inferior education put them at an economic and social disadvantage, from their receiving outdated hand-me-down books from white children, to their lowly social standing overall.It cannot be said enough that children of color suffer greatly. In that context Brown v. Board of Education was a remedy to right a grievous wrong.Today as we look back and then turn again towards the future, I am dismayed. I am not dismayed at how Americans have continued to undo past wrongs. Nor am I dismayed at the shoulders on which I stand and what they tried to accomplish. Integration in the context of their times had its merits. What dismays me is that any lessons we can learn from the past appear to be lost on this generation of leaders. And for that I feel we must find a fix.In retrospect, a lot of things have happened in education since the 1950s. The nobility of true integration was not accomplished and a new form of segregation has taken the place of the old. Yet, while Brown v. Board of Education was certainly about education, it was about much more. It was part of a long chain of events which each successive generation took a turn to right wrong and chip away at racism and segregation. Now it is our turn to try and attain that elusive ideal of one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.I am a product of public school. I have always been in support of public education. A public education has served my wife, Ivy, and I, as well as my daughter, Carol, who also attends a public elementary school in the city of St. Louis; and, in fact, her school, Kennard Classical Junior Academy, was one of 15 schools in the State of Missouri recently given the distinction of a gold star status. So not all public education is problematic.Both St. Louis and Missouri have a lot of relevant educational history. For example, the St. Louis public schools opened the Nation's first kindergarten. And in the 1840s it was illegal for African Americans to read and write. First Baptist Church Pastor John Berry Meachum took matters into his own hands. Mr. Meachum opened the Freedom School on a barge in the Mississippi River which was Federally owned and thus out of the reach of State law. And at the college level, a 1938 Missouri case, Missouri ex rel Gaines v. Canada, found that the University of Missouri by denying a black student administrations to its law school, though it did create a separate black law school in a building housing a movie theater and a hotel, created an unfair privilege for white students that did not extend to similarly qualified African American students.Mr. Speaker, like a strait jacket, segregation debilitated this Nation for generations. But the victory of Brown v. Board of Education was not happenstance. It was the result of a well-thought-out strategy by a progressive people trying to build a progressive Nation. Comprised of a combination of five lawsuits from around the Nation, Brown v. Board was argued using expert witnesses to show the psychological and sociological damage of inferiority done to black children as a result of segregation.Convinced separate but equal violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the high Court would ban segregation in public schools. As we all know, desegregation was not immediate, easy, nor complete. In a separate decision known as Brown II in 1955, the Court set desegregation guidelines. But without deadlines, only the infamous ``with all deliberate speed'' in the opinion, segregation lingered and segregationist met integration with violence and hatred. With integration, some whites fled to the suburbs creating de facto segregation in urban schools. And as the urban core deteriorated by the outflow of population and businesses, the urban schools have essentially become second class schools, separate and unequal, despite the law.In closing, I want to thank the leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus for scheduling this time to mark the anniversary of a major milestone. Certainly the shortcomings of the last half century were no fault of Brown v. Board of Education. Certainly it was not the children who dutifully woke up every morning and attended classes in schools provided by governments throughout this Nation. And most certainly it is not the poor and economically impoverished Americans trying to feed those children every day and trusting that one day their lives would be better for them and their children.The children have not failed. Those in government who build, staff and fund this Nation's schools have collectively failed the children. When government officials spend more to incarcerate than to educate, it sends the wrong message to our youths. When government blames the victims of racism, economic oppression, and cultural bias and punishes them through denial, sanctions and promises left unfilled, then there is no wonder the youth of this Nation have rebelled en masse against education, a law-abiding life-style, and unfulfilled promises. Such reality today is as important as Brown v. Board of Education was to this Nation then.The abiding purpose of government is to promote stability in our communities and to care for those who cannot care for themselves. The rich will always take care of themselves and many send their children to private schools run by people they have a voice in choosing and in facilities they help build. The common everyday citizen lacks that luxury. With many of our public school systems in disarray, teachers spending more time trying to maintain order and not teach, for millions of American children the future is not bright. Again, it is not because of Brown v. Board of Education; rather, it is systemic failure of government to care about educating our children.God forbid that another generation of Americans indigenous to this Nation remain undereducated, underserved and in poverty. That was the real point, the real goal of Brown v. Board of Education. And that age-old dream of future generations of equally educated American children building a Nation capable of overcoming the burden of a segregated divisive America has yet to come true.Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.,2015-03-16 18:06:01.605123,2015-03-16 18:06:01.605123,House,COMMEMORATING THE 49TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN V.

416,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 17 Northwest Missouri school districts that have been recognized as ``most-improved'' by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. This recognition highlights the outstanding commitment Northwest Missouri has made to ensure that no child is left behind.Since 1998, Missouri has administered the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) tests yearly to measure a student's achievement. The mathematics assessment is given to fourth, seventh, and 10th graders. A communications arts assessment is given to third, seventh, and 11th graders, a science assessment is given to third, seventh, and 10th graders and a social studies assessment is given to the fourth, eighth, and 11th grades. A health/physical education assessment is given to fifth and ninth graders as well. These important tests help Missouri's schools identify both strong and weak academic areas. Most importantly, the MAP tests illustrate the progress Northwest Missouri's school districts have made in providing students with the best available education.I would like to acknowledge the Saint Joseph school district, which appeared four times on the ``most improved top ten'' list. These schools are Hall Elementary, Webster Elementary (appeared twice), and Lafayette High School. Barry School, in Platte County, appeared three times on the top ten list, and Nodaway County placed four of its schools on the list.Other Northwest Missouri schools appearing on the most improved list include Chillicothe High School, Penney High School, Pickering Elementary School, Tri-County High School, West Platte High School, Craig High School, Fairfax Elementary School, North Harrison High School, Northeast Nodaway High School, Pattonsburg High School, Savannah High School, Smithville High School, South Nodaway High School, Southwest High School, Stanberry Elementary, Tri-County Elementary, West Nordaway High School, and West Nodaway Elementary.Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the above schools for their ongoing efforts to strengthen education and the hardworking students who demonstrated their knowledge. I am confident these schools will continue to successfully meet their educational goals.,2015-03-16 18:06:01.760238,2015-03-16 18:06:01.760238,Extensions,CONGRATULATING 17 NORTHWEST MISSOURI SCHOOL DISTRICTS,2002-04-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-29/html/CREC-2002-04-29-pt1-PgE651-3.htm,50,0,148,E651-E652,G000546,mr. graves
417,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, Lincoln University, in Jefferson City, Missouri, is an historic black college that has served Missouri and our nation well since the latter part of the 1800s.

418,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Chairman, I thank the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. I think the fundamental point here is that no school district has to lose money or will lose money under this bill. This is not about school districts losing money. This is about bureaucrats in Washington losing money. This is about bureaucrats at the State level losing money. This is not about school districts losing money.Those people who say this money is going to go from one school district to another are not reading the bill the way the bill has to be read. This is the difference in whether 95 cents out of every education dollar gets to the classroom, or 65 cents out of every education dollar gets to the classroom.This is clearly not something that people who are in favor of the bureaucracy growing would want to be for. It is clearly something that people who are for money being spent in classrooms, on teachers, on education should be for. This is about a teacher who knows every student's name having more to say about how the money is spent. This is about districts that now may not qualify for all 31 of these different grant programs, but is a district that gets to qualify for money, they get to use the money in the way that they understand is best for their district.Even the opponents of this bill concede that the Federal impact they say is minimal. Well, the minimal impact is not what does the job. What does the job is making education work. It is involving families more in the process. It is involving teachers more in the process. It is involving the local building administrator in the process. It is figuring out what can be done for those kids at that school on that day with 95 percent of this money.,2015-03-16 18:06:02.048466,2015-03-16 18:06:02.048466,House,DOLLARS TO THE CLASSROOM ACT,1998-09-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-09-18/html/CREC-1998-09-18-pt1-PgH8037-7.htm,125,43,144,H8037-H8072,B000575,mr. blunt

420,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for his hard work and the good work he has done on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. This has been a task of assembling the right components that were acceptable to a broad range of interests and reflecting the capacity of States and local communities to make good decisions. I think the Senator has done an outstanding job. I am pleased to have the privilege of being a cosponsor of this bill.Under this legislation, the State of Missouri, my own State, as well as every other State in the Nation, will no longer have to come to Washington on a piecemeal, case-by-case basis to ask for relief from a myriad of Federal education statutes and regulations. Instead, Missouri will have the authority to waive regulations that hinder our schools from providing an excellent education for our students.Now, I know that the occupant of the Chair is a former Governor and had a lot of involvement with individuals in the education effort which is focused at the State level. I remember those days well from my time as Governor. It is most satisfying to try to do something to advance the performance of students. We understand that when students perform well and have great skills, it elevates the potential they enjoy for the rest of their lives.It was always a tremendous matter of concern to me--and I am sure to the occupant of the Chair--how Federal administrative burdens impeded the efforts of States rather than accelerated their capacity to help students perform. I think most Governors and former Governors we talked to would agree that Federal mandates and requirements associated with Federal programs can hinder a State's flexibility and, as a result, they cut into the dollars that could be spent on students. They end up being spent on bureaucracy--not just bureaucracy here in Washington, but a corresponding bureaucracy to deal with the Washington bureaucracy that has to be established and maintained in the States.In response to the question of whether we should impose Federal education standards from Washington, Governor Whitman of New Jersey said, and I think she said it well,What you see now is a huge waste of money on bureaucracy. The more government strings that are on these dollars, the more difficult it becomes to deliver education. If the money that the Federal Government now puts out is too finite and it says you can only spend it for this or for that, that money won't go toward helping students learn, and that's what we want.I agree with the entirety of the statement--``helping students learn, and that's what we want''--and the last line should be the motivation for every one of us not only in the Senate but across America. I simply couldn't agree with Governor Whitman more.States and local schools need more flexibility in how to spend education dollars, to spend them in ways that will help students learn. They are in the best position to make decisions about the education of students. I have to believe that being on site adds value to one's capacity to make an accurate diagnosis or assessment of what is needed.I appreciate the opportunity to speak regarding the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, which will provide States and local schools with the kind of flexibility they need to improve education and to elevate student performance.One of our Nation's highest priorities is to ensure that our children receive the kind of challenging and rigorous education that will prepare them for success. By building a strong educational foundation that focuses on the concept of high academic excellence, we will prepare students to make important career decisions and to become lifelong learners. The habit of education should extend beyond school. As a result, their lives will be enriched.We in Congress should develop and support Federal policies that will promote the best education practices in our States and local schools. We have learned from reports and studies that successful schools and successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement in the education of their children. They are characterized by parental involvement and local control, and they emphasize basic academics and make resources available to the classroom. These are the ingredients needed to elevate educational performance.It is with this in mind that we should stop and ask ourselves whether the current Federal education laws contain the elements that further our goal of giving our kids a world-class education. The unfortunate answer to that question is, our current laws don't do that; the answer is no. A number of our Federal education programs contain a plethora of regulations and restrictions that hinder States and local schools, hinder their ability to tailor and design what is needed in the local circumstance to advance the opportunity for students to learn. Whenever they hinder and obstruct that opportunity to tailor and design the right system, they waste the education dollars.Frequently, education dollars that Washington directs in terms of how to spend them are wasted because the how-to doesn't meet the need of the students and the school district.While the Federal Government has played an important but limited role in providing funding for education, it has also played a conflicting role by attaching so many conditions and strings to Federal dollars that it costs States and local schools a lot of time and resources to comply with all the rules and regulations.We have heard much about the paperwork burdens created by the Federal education rules and regulations. The Federal Department of Education requires States and school districts to complete over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This is a statistic that is mind boggling. That translates into the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time just to do the paperwork for States to get their own money back to educate the students, which the State cares enough about to work hard to make sure that they are trying to elevate the students' performance.We heard that in Florida it takes 374 employees to administer $8 billion in State funds, while it takes 297 State employees to oversee $1 billion in Federal funds--6 times as many per dollar. So that to do the paperwork and create the paper trail and all the paper involvement, to be a recipient of Federal funds, it takes six times as many employees as it does to follow a dollar of State funding in Florida.We know it takes a school nearly 20 weeks, 216 steps, to complete a discretionary grant process within the Department of Education. The Department has boasted that it has streamlined the process, because it used to take 26 weeks and 487 steps from start to finish; now it is only 216 steps in the bureaucratic jungle. With this bureaucratic maze, it is no wonder we lose about 35 cents out of every Federal education dollar before it reaches the classroom.If I were to give my children a dollar and, before I got it from my hand to their hand, I took 35 cents out of the dollar, they would know the difference. We tell ourselves that we are doing great things for education, but before the dollar reaches the student, 35 cents is taken out of the dollar. They know the difference. The difference is felt. And then sometimes we are telling them it has to be spent in a way that doesn't elevate student performance.Current Federal laws, of course, can also be inflexible, requiring the Federal education dollar to be spent only for a narrow purpose, to the exclusion of all others. This type of inflexibility hurts schools that have needs other than the ones prescribed by the Federal Government. A recent example was the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for the early elementary grades. What a noble aspiration. But it wasn't what a number of schools needed. Governor Gray Davis of California recently described how the inflexibility of this initiative is hindering his State's ability to direct Federal funds to areas where they are most needed. Governor Davis said:We need to have the flexibility to apply those resources where we think they could best be used.He went on to say:For example, I was just with Secretary Riley, our U.S. Secretary of Education, for 2 days last week in California. And Secretary Riley was telling me about the $1.2 billion that was appropriated to reduce class size to 18 in the first 3 grades. Now, in California, we are already down to 20 students per class size in K through four. So that money, which is supposed to be earmarked to the area where we have pretty much achieved the goal, would best serve our needs by reducing class size in math and English at the tenth grade level, because we have just started to use a high school graduation exam.Here is a State wanting to elevate the performance of students, with a massive Federal program directed at an area where they have already addressed the problem, but it is ineligible to be used in an area where they need help. We should really understand this. That is why we are proposing in this Ed-Flex program a massive new capacity on the part of States to use money where it is needed, to use money to help get the dollar all the way to the student, and not take 35 cents out of the dollar when it is on its way from the folks in Washington to the classroom where the student studies.Another example is found in title I, which authorizes aid for the education of disadvantaged children. Some of the rigid standards in this program can result in a school losing its ability to provide intensive services to students on a schoolwide basis because it fails by 1 percentage point to have the requisite number of children below a certain income level. Such policies fly in the face of one ingredient for educational success, one vital ingredient: local control.Fortunately, there is a current Federal policy that has helped provide more flexibility and relieve States of regulatory burdens that are associated with otherwise inflexible education dollars. Under the Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, the Department of Education has delegated its authority to 12 participating States to grant individual school districts waivers from certain Federal requirements that hinder States and schools in their efforts to improve their education programs. Under Ed-Flex--this proposal, not just for the 12 States, but for all 50 States--school districts do not have to march up to Washington each time they want to ask for a waiver. Instead, they can get the waiver from their own State.The Ed-Flex program, as it is called, has reduced paperwork burdens. That sounds good, to reduce paperwork, but when you take the expensive paperwork out of the equation, more of the resource reaches the classroom. Sure, it is good to reduce paperwork, but it is even better to deliver the resource to the site of learning, where students learn.For example, in response to a perceived need, Texas schools have been able to direct some of their Federal funds from the title II Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which is targeted primarily for science and mathematics, to reading, English language, arts, and social studies. If you need help in English and the arts and social studies, why not be able to focus the attention there?In Howard County, MD, Ed-Flex authority has allowed schools to provide additional instruction time in reading and math to better meet the needs of their students. Well, you mean a program that serves the needs of the students instead of serving the plan of the bureaucracy? What a good program.These are all States that have been allowed, in the 12-State pilot program, to have this kind of flexibility--it is interesting that they are moving resources to help students. Oregon used its waiver authority to simplify its planning and application process so that its school districts can develop a single plan that consolidates the application for Federal funds. Well, that is great. Instead of spending more money on paperwork, we are making resources available to the classrooms where students study and achieve.In Vermont, they have reported that the greatest advantage of having Ed-Flex is the ability of schools and districts to gain waivers without having to go directly to the Department of Education. The fact that the State can grant waivers with a minimum of redtape encourages schools and districts to ask for waivers they might not otherwise have asked for. You see, the intimidation factor of Federal regulation is one that is hard to assess. But here is the State of Vermont basically saying they were lacking creativity in their schools and people didn't bother to try to ask for the waiver. They went ahead and did what Washington said, in spite of the fact that it may not have been best for students, because they had been intimidated. The process was too complex. The desire to get a waiver may never have been really strong enough to get them past the Federal bureaucracy. But the schools are now doing things, trying things, delivering help to students, meeting needs at the site of learning, rather than meeting the appetite of the bureaucracy.Other Ed-Flex States have used the waiver authority to include all school improvement resources in a single 34-page plan rather than 8 separate plans totaling 200 pages. Can you imagine that? If you can move the paperwork down in the direction of sort of manual operations from 200 pages to 34 pages, you will cut out that kind of paperwork and you are cutting out a wasted resource, and when you stop wasting, you can start delivering.I am sure this next item is of special interest to the occupant of the Chair, who served as the chief executive of Ohio. Reports indicate that Ohio used its Ed-Flex authority to significantly reduce paperwork in the schools. The education agency of the State also reduced its paperwork. This is great news to hear. Ohio is the State that reported at one time that 52 percent of all the paperwork--I think that is right; the Chair might correct me--required of their school districts was related to participation in Federal programs while the Federal dollars were about 5 percent of the State's total education budget. That means we are costing people a lot in terms of paperwork to get a very small amount of the resource. It is time we freed the system from the burden of paperwork so it can get moving forward to the task of helping students.States are finding that flexibility and regulatory relief they have gotten under the Ed-Flex program has caused increased student performance. Texas has found that its schools with Ed-Flex waivers made gains that match--and in many instances exceed--those as a whole in the State. And frequently those schools with the waivers were ones that were especially challenged.Because of the success of the Ed-Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, we need to expand this concept to every State in America. In my home State of Missouri, we don't currently have broad authority, the kind of authority we need to waive the Federal regulations that keep our schools from improving education programs. In the past few years, my State, as well as local districts in Missouri, have had to come to Washington on a number of occasions and ask for waivers of certain Federal education statutes so they could administer their programs in such a way that they can better serve their students. It doesn't make any sense for a State or a school district to keep coming to Washington time after time to beg for permission to help their students. It seems like we could agree that we would allow States to help their students.That is why I support the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, because it gives the States the authority on their own to grant to schools waivers of Federal statutes and regulations for many Federal education programs. States will also be expected to grant waivers of their own regulations which schools believe are barriers to improving education programs. This is a design--a conspicuous and conscious design--to deliver resources to classrooms where students learn and improve their performance.Around the Nation, Governors of both political parties have called for quick passage of this legislation as it will allow educators to design and to deliver federally funded education dollars in ways that meet the needs of students. As a former Governor, I know how important it is for a State and its local school districts to have decisionmaking authority over educational matters. The closer the decisionmaking is to the local level, I feel, the better.States and local schools are in a better position to know what programs work in their community and elicit the necessary enthusiasm and response from their families which are being served.I also know that States want to show that their education reforms will actually improve quality of education. When I was Governor of Missouri, I also served as chairman of the Education Commission of the States--all 50 States, legislators, governors, school board officials--the Education Commission of the States. During that time I emphasized a point. And it was this: We must insist that our reform programs create a current of educational improvement. We must show that reforms actually help our children learn more.Mr. President, I believe that Ed-Flex boosts educational achievement by allowing States to direct resources where they will get to the classroom and help students learn.So today I want to voice my strong support for the Educational Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. Under this legislation, Missouri schools and schools across America no longer have to come to Washington to seek education waivers one at a time. But they will have more flexibility to administer federally funded education programs in ways that boost student achievement, and ultimately have as a result more capable students.States and local schools want more flexibility because they have the best ideas of what will work in their communities. And they want the ability to take that good news to the students of their schools. Important education groups in my State such as the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri School Board Association have said that flexibility and local control are important goals in Federal education policy.The Ed-Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 helps to accomplish these goals. This bill, Ed-Flex, will ultimately help to improve educational opportunities for the children in my State and all over the country by reducing the Federal redtape involved currently with trying to comply with Federal rules and regulations related to educational programs.,2015-03-16 18:06:02.340674,2015-03-16 18:06:02.340674,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT,1999-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-04/html/CREC-1999-03-04-pt1-PgS2255.htm,34,0,145,S2255-S2257,A000356,mr. ashcroft

But there is still much more work to be done.Because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an estimated 8,500 teaching jobs have been saved in my home State of Missouri alone. Without the Recovery Act, thousands of teachers would have lost their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of students would be losing out on individual attention vital to their education. It was the right thing to do to provide States with the resources to keep America's teachers teaching and continue investing in our children's education.This stimulus is putting us on the road to recovery by putting money back in the pockets of middle-class Americans and making critical investments in our future, like education and preparing for today's clean energy jobs.We must continue our aggressive push to put Americans back to work and make investments in ourselves for this new era of global competition.

Board of Education decision that is now celebrating a major historical birthday.We have come a long way. I was in school back in those days before Brown v. Board of Education. I can tell you it has not been an easy struggle.President Dwight Eisenhower called up the military to go into Little Rock to integrate the schools. Battle after battle was fought.Fifteen years later, I had the honor of serving the chief judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, GA, one of President Eisenhower's appointees who fought the battle to carry out the civil rights reforms that had been ordered by the courts and enacted into law.This has been a long and tortuous journey. We have made great progress. There is still a way to go. But I think we all can take pride in the fact that as a result of Brown v.

429,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Madam President, I came here to recognize and commend the great work of Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy on crafting an IDEA bill. They produced a solid, thoughtful, bipartisan bill which protects the educational rights of children with special needs while at the same time making IDEA more workable for parents, teachers, school administrators, and school districts.I think we all agree IDEA was a great idea. It helped open doors for many children with special needs since it was enacted in 1975. Yet there is no question that significant problems exist.As I traveled through Missouri and talked with educators, teachers, administrators, parents, and school board members, I heard all kinds of problems with IDEA. Over the years, these teachers, principals, and administrators in Missouri have told me IDEA has become a morass of rules, of regulations and litigation that truly limit access and in some instances actually hinder learning--not just for children with disabilities but for all children. That is simply not acceptable.Educators are struggling under a crushing procedural and paperwork burden imposed by IDEA, contributing to what is becoming a chronic shortage of quality teachers in special education in Missouri and nationwide. Special education teachers are leaving the profession--not out of frustration with the children whom they are there to serve, but out of frustration with the overwhelming and unnecessary paperwork and the regulatory burdens they face. Without a qualified teacher, a child with a disability cannot receive a free, appropriate public education.Most special educators report they have to spend 20 to 50 percent of their time on paperwork. More time spent on paperwork is less time spent with students or preparing lesson plans for students. It is as simple as that. We cannot continue to let IDEA interfere with the time educators can devote to the children they serve because we all know a misdirected focus on paperwork, on procedures, and on bureaucracy frustrates teachers and fails to give children the education they need.In addition, over the years IDEA has encouraged and fostered adversarial relationships between school districts, staff, and parents. Time, money, and resources exhausted in costly litigation would be far better spent on instruction for children. Taking limited dollars away from children with disabilities and redirecting them to attorneys to fight long and costly battles is simply counterproductive. It does not help the education of our children--all children, special children and other children in the schools.These are a few of the concerns I have heard from Missouri educators over the years. But the thing I like about Missouri educators is they don't simply tell me what the problem is; they show me how to fix it. Maybe that is one of the reasons they call Missouri the ``Show Me'' State.The Missouri School Board Association's Special Education Advocacy Council, working in partnership with the Missouri Council of Administrators of Special Education, developed a list of thoughtful, solid, and detailed recommendations to improve IDEA and inject a little bit of good old-fashioned commonsense reform to IDEA.In fact, the Missouri Special Education Advocacy Council examined the IDEA statute line by line and told me exactly where and how we improve the statute by refocusing special education on educating children with special needs rather than simply complying with a system of complex regulations and mountains of paperwork and red tape.I am pleased many of the recommendations made by MSBA's Special Education Advocacy Council have been incorporated in S. 1248. The numerous paperwork and regulatory reforms in the bill will go a long way to free special educators' time to spend with their students and in preparing effective instruction plans. In addition, this bill contains many provisions to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents and school districts.I thank both Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for including these critical reforms in the Senate bill. This bill will improve and strengthen IDEA and extend the promise of quality education for a new generation of children with special needs.I urge my colleagues to support this bill.There is one other thing I want to address. I want to talk a minute about funding IDEA. We heard a lot of talk yesterday about the broken promises. The authorization for IDEA said the Federal Government is going to provide 40 percent of the cost of IDEA. Over 19 years, funding for IDEA has increased from $251,000 in 1977 to $2.3 billion in 1996.Our side took control of Congress in 1995, and over the course of that time period, the Republican Congress has increased funding for IDEA by 224 percent since 1996. That was done through the appropriations process.If the President's budget is enacted, it will have increased funding for IDEA by 376 percent. The average per-pupil expenditure has increased from 7 percent to almost 20 percent. If you include the President's budget request for this year, IDEA funding since 2001 will have increased $4.7 billion--75 percent in this President's budget.In comparison, in the 1980s IDEA was one of the spending appropriations categories that did not increase. In fact, in many of those years the Federal Government covered less than the States' average per-pupil expenditure for children with disabilities than it had the year before. I am proud of our leadership in this Congress which has made steady progress toward finally trying to reach the 40-percent level authorized in 1975. We have made great strides toward fulfilling the commitment. I know the people in education are very appreciative of those increases.,2015-03-16 18:06:03.663590,2015-03-16 18:06:03.663590,Senate,IDEA,2004-05-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-05-13/html/CREC-2004-05-13-pt1-PgS5393.htm,67,0,150,S5393,B000611,mr. bond
430,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, a landmark Supreme Court case that gave rise to Linda Brown's dream of equality in education in this country, a dream deferred that has become for many a broken promise.The 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision marked a turning point in our history and incited a movement to break down barriers of race that had long plagued communities across the nation. It helped pave the road toward integral measures such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Fair Housing Act of 1968 and began the movement for desegregation. Chief Justice Earl Warren felt the ruling was so historic he issued a rare public statement: ``We conclude that in the field of public education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place.'' In declaring segregation unconstitutional, the Supreme Court mandated a focus on equality not only in education, but also in public transportation, accommodations and commerce.The Brown v. Board of Education decision demanded that all Americans be entitled to the fundamental right to equal educational opportunities, regardless of race, and the resources to achieve their dreams. But by the time Martin Luther King, Jr. addressed America from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, nearly ten years later, that promise remained unfulfilled. And half a century later, with the convulsing explosions of the Civil Rights Movement behind us, the future assured to Linda Brown in that historic ruling has been approached, but not yet reached. And we are left to wonder, like Langston Hughes in his poem ``A Dream Deferred,'' whether those promises, if not fulfilled, will one day cease to exist.Fifty years ago, Linda Brown, a third grader in Topeka, Kansas, and her father had the courage to protest the long accepted ``separate but equal'' principle that required her to walk for over an hour every morning because she was not permitted to attend the white-only school just blocks from her house. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court struck down the ``badge of inferiority for African Americans'' that the principle of ``separate but equal'' had come to signify.This week we honor all those who fought for the dream of equality of opportunity: the valiant families who came forward in these five cases; the NAACP legal defense team, including Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood Marshall, Robert L. Carter, Kenneth B. Clark and Judge Constance Motley; and the community which held on to the dream through years of bitter opposition and violent protest in the South. But half a century later, urban and rural schools across America lack the funding to provide equal education opportunities for all students.An Education Trust study released last week reveals alarming statistics about the state of education: Minority students are about three years behind other students by the time they reach eighth grade; 17-year-old African American and Latino students have reading and math skills similar to those of 13-year-old white students; and African American and Latino and American Indian youth are less likely to be enrolled in full college prep coursework.No Child Left Behind, underfunded by $27 billion, could achieve the dream of Brown v. Board of Education if provided with the resources to dismantle unequal opportunities and enhance the quality of education for every community. Fifty years after Brown, we continue to make promises we cannot keep.As we remember today the dream of Linda Brown and the courageous civil rights leaders to whom we owe our progress, let us remember that the most fitting tribute to them is a continued effort to fulfill their vision for our nation. Let us continue the promise of Brown by breaking down the barriers that still persist in our classrooms and giving schools the resources they need to provide a safe and productive learning environment for our children.Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this historic anniversary and renewing the effort to achieve the promise of Brown v. Board of Education: equal educational opportunities for all children. Let us not defer the dream any longer.,2015-03-16 18:06:03.841719,2015-03-16 18:06:03.841719,Extensions,COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN v.

433,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from New Mexico yielding and especially for taking the initiative to really focus on what I believe should be a national dialogue, and that is the education of our kids.I am not embarrassed to admit that I am a 5-month-old parent. And, of course, as a new parent, one's attention begins to focus maybe on different priorities. I know in our household we have, and we have begun to think about the education of our daughter Casey Elizabeth.Here in Washington, as my friend knows, too often I think we begin to focus on or define our Nation's educational success by how many dollars that we put toward public education. If that were the yardstick, then I think the Republicans here in the House deserve great credit. Since 1995, public funding education has been increased by 27 percent over those several years.But that is not how I think we should define educational success. To me, it is much simpler than that; that success is defined by how much our children learn. And, of course, I think key in that is trying to get parents to become more involved in the education of their kids.Now, as my colleague knows, as a mother, we cannot pass a law in this body that mandates parents' attendance at PTA meetings. Some wish maybe we could force that mandate on families, but that is not the role of the Government. But I think there are things that we can do. And as my friend has talked about, the bill that we have on the floor on Thursday this week, H.R. 7, I think is a key component. It is not the answer to all of our educational problems; but I think as far as parental control, we do provide some incentives, yes, through the Tax Code.Our idea of this bill is very simple. We think that the Federal tax should be eliminated if they are saving for education. As my colleague was pointing out just a few minutes ago, current law that this President signed into law, this education savings account, says that up to $500 a year can be contributed by a family member into an account.But as you also very ably pointed out that even if, let us say, over the course of the lifetime of your child, from the moment they were born every year until they go to college, the money they would have saved for college is about $15,000 and that is assuming compound interest at about 7\1/2\ percent. So I think first and foremost, we have to sort of take that limit off to really encourage parents to be saving even more for the education of their kids.To me, the perfect bill that the President should sign into law would be, number one, an elimination of the marriage penalty tax; and since most of that is about $1,400 more per couple, then that family with children can plug that money into an expanded education savings account. As you pointed out, the point is saving for higher education is important.And yes, perhaps the controversy in this bill as we are probably going to hear in less measured tones as we debate this bill in the next couple of days is, we think that elementary and secondary education expenses should qualify. If your first grader is having a tough time reading, why not use the proceeds of an education savings account to maybe purchase Hooked on Phonics to help bring your child up to the reading level that he or she should be in a particular grade. If you are having trouble with math, maybe a home computer or a computer program that might help a child learn math better, or maybe a foreign language. It could even be expenses like car pooling or transportation expenses. The beauty of an expanded savings account is, it is not the government saying how money should be spent. It is the parents. I think what a powerful ally that a parent can be working with a teacher in addressing the special needs of that particular child.,2015-03-16 18:06:04.308072,2015-03-16 18:06:04.308072,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,2000-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-28/html/CREC-2000-03-28-pt1-PgH1455-4.htm,36,2,146,H1455-H1461,H000948,mr. hulshof
434,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service that June L. Harris has provided the House for the past 21 years. June, like myself, is retiring at the end of this Congress, and I want to thank her for her many years of service to me and our institution.June came to work for me in 1979. She has spent nearly her entire career here in Congress working on educational issues, specifically ensuring that educational opportunity exists for the most vulnerable in our society. June has worked in both my personal office and on my Education and the Workforce Committee staff, where she presently serves as Education Coordinator. Prior to her Capitol Hill career, June was a teacher in the Baltimore public schools and the head of a department in a junior high school. June has also earned a Ph.D from the University of Maryland, showing evidence of her own personal pursuit of excellence.June has always fought to make sure all Americans have the opportunity to succeed. She has represented me well by helping open the doors of educational and economic opportunity for our most disadvantaged citizens. June has always stood for what was right and never compromised her principles. She has provided me with 21 years of invaluable service that has improved the education of the children of St. Louis and the nation. Today, I want to say thank you for all that she has done and wish her well in her retirement.,2015-03-16 18:06:04.475170,2015-03-16 18:06:04.475170,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO JUNE L.

435,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished manager.Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coverdell measure and in support of the Gorton-Frist amendment and in support of the Ashcroft amendment. We have an opportunity as a body to make some very clear statements about education that the people in our States are asking us to make.I firmly believe that education is a national priority but a local responsibility. This leads to a fundamental difference between this side and what might be referred to as a Washington establishment on education.I believe that those who know the names of the students personally are better at making decisions than those who don't know them. Unfortunately, Federal involvement in education over the years has started off with a great idea of providing resources in support for what we believe for our children is the highest priority, and that is getting them a good education, but it has mushroomed into burdensome regulations, judicial intrusion, unfunded mandates and unwanted meddling.The results have been that local school officials who are accountable to parents and communities have increasingly less and less control over what goes on in their classrooms. In some cases, parents really feel that they have lost control of their child's education. They have told me horror stories about how their children are not getting an education because of requirements that the Federal Government has put on the schools.I believe that parents and local school boards are and must be the key to true educational reform, not big Government. We should be empowering parents and teachers and school districts and States to develop challenging academic standards, programs and priorities, not making their jobs of educating children of America more difficult.As my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, said, we already have standards, we already have tests. As a result of those tests, we know where the problems are in education, and we need to do something about it. Yes, nationally we ought to focus on the problem, but we ought not to try to solve with a ``Washington, DC, solution'' the problems we face in every community and every city throughout Missouri and throughout America.I have had a very interesting and informative experience over the last year and a half talking to school board members, talking to teachers, talking to principals and talking to parents across my State of Missouri. It is from these discussions that I come back here with a renewed commitment to keep local control over education.We have school districts in Missouri hiring hordes of consultants and grant writers instead of teachers because they know they have to play ``Mother May I?'' with Washington, DC. We have some schools, the smaller schools, that say they don't even bother to apply for the Federal funds because they don't have the time and the resources to prepare the application.Leaders in school districts have told me of the unforeseen consequences of getting a grant. They get a grant development program and the grant expires and the school district has to determine whether to take local money from existing resources to continue the program or to eliminate it.One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said very, very convincingly today, and I love these words, ``The Federal Government doesn't run schools, and the Federal Government doesn't fund schools.'' I agree with those principles. I just wish that he were correct in the facts.The Federal Government should not be micromanaging school districts. In Missouri, 67 percent of the funds that go to the school districts come from the Federal Government. These are general funds for K through 12. They tell me, depending upon the school district, that anywhere from 40 to 85 percent of the red tape and the hassle and the regulations come from Washington.I don't think that is right. Last year, when we adopted the Gorton amendment to send money directly to the schools, some of my colleagues very eloquently said, ``We don't want to have Federal dollars going directly to school districts because the school districts will waste the money; they might build athletic facilities; or they will waste it in some other way.''Mr. President, I have spent my adult career working with parents and teachers and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I have watched their education decisions. I have spent about the last 11 years in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal bureaucracy administer programs. And when it comes to who wastes money, Mr. President, it is not even close. It is not a contest. The Washington way wastes more money by far. The locally controlled schools are far better at applying those dollars to the needs of the children in their schools.There is no disagreement that in some cases a local school district may need money to build some more schools or it may need money to hire more teachers. For some schools, new textbooks should be the top priority. For others, additional computers might be needed or a school safety program might need to be implemented.Who knows best? Those at the local level, held accountable by those they serve, or the bureaucrats in Washington? A one-size-fits-all approach does not and will not work in education. Let us give our schools, our teachers, and our parents the resources and flexibility they need to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement and accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendments and to support the bill, and I urge that they give a sound, strong endorsement to local control over education.I reserve the remainder of the time on this side and yield the floor. Again, I extend my sincere thanks to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.,2015-03-16 18:06:04.630274,2015-03-16 18:06:04.630274,Senate,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS,1998-04-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-22/html/CREC-1998-04-22-pt1-PgS3410.htm,45,4,144,S3410-S3423,B000611,mr. bond
436,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Chairman, I rise today to talk about a very important issue, and that is overidentification and misidentification of children with suspected learning behavioral disabilities. If schools misdiagnose a child, it not only affects their report card, but it affects their future. We need to make sure that the right children receive special education.The Tancredo-Graves amendment seeks to address this problem which is driving up the cost of IDEA and putting misdiagnosed kids into special needs programs. The majority of kids with disabilities are medically diagnosed and, therefore, receive special education services. Children with learning and behavioral disorders should be no different.The bottom line is if a child has a medical disability, whether it be physical, mental, learning or behavioral, it should be diagnosed and have a medical opinion from a medical professional in order to receive the same special education services as those children that are medically diagnosed.The Tancredo-Graves amendment would protect parents, and most importantly, it would protect children from being labeled with a disability that they may not have.,2015-03-16 18:06:04.796396,2015-03-16 18:06:04.796396,House,IMPROVING EDUCATION RESULTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 2003,2003-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-30/html/CREC-2003-04-30-pt1-PgH3458.htm,63,224,149,H3458-H3531,G000546,mr. graves

439,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, studies and reports have shown that PAT children at age 3 are found to be significantly more advanced than comparison children in language, problem solving, and social development. Often, through participation in PAT, learning problems or development delays are identified and treated early.PAT parents are more confident in their parenting abilities and knowledge. The great thing is, PAT hooks parents early on which means that they are more likely to stay involved in their children's schooling.We all know that we can have all the programs in the world and can provide all the funding possible, but one of the main ingredients to a child's success in school is the involvement of the child's parents in the child's education.As I said, earlier this year I received a copy of a report from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report was the ``School Entry Assessment Project''. The summary of findings reinforced my interest, support, and commitment to PAT. The findings of the report are as follows:1. When Parents as Teachers is combined with any other pre- kindergarten experience for high-poverty children, the children score above average on all scales when they enter kindergarten. 2. The highest performing children participate in PAT and preschool or center care. Among children who participate in PAT and attend preschool, both minority and non-minority children score above average. Children in both high-poverty and low-poverty schools who participate in PAT and attend preschool score above average when they enter kindergarten. 3. Among children whose care and education are sole home- based, those whose families participate in PAT score significantly higher. 4. Special needs children who participate in PAT and preschool in addition to an early childhood special education program are rated by teachers as being similar in preparation to the average child. 5. Head Start children who also participate in PAT and another preschool score at average or above when they enter kindergarten.This findings sum it all up. PAT works. PAT works for children raised in household of all income levels. PAT works for children who are home-schooled. PAT works for our special needs children.My amendment makes certain that priority is given to programs such as PAT and other early childhood parent education programs.With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.I yield the floor.,2015-03-16 18:06:05.260726,2015-03-16 18:06:05.260726,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT,2001-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-16/html/CREC-2001-05-16-pt1-PgS4970-2.htm,67,177,147,S4970-S4999,B000611,mr. bond
440,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) for their great bipartisan teamwork on this very important higher education initiative. They worked for better than a year to fashion legislation that I believe strengthens our country's commitment to higher education.I also want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman Goodling) and all the committee members who made valuable contributions to the higher education reauthorization effort. I am pleased to give my enthusiastic support for this bill.The bill strengthens student aid financing by significantly reducing student loan interest rates, increasing Pell Grants and improving the calculations of benefits for independent and dependent students. The bill adopts a number of measures that enhance support for minority and disadvantaged students by strengthening the TRIO program and other programs supporting historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions and tribally controlled colleges.Mr. Chairman, I am also pleased that the committee adopted President Clinton's High Hopes program. And I commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) for his successful advocacy of this important initiative.Mr. Chairman, the bill also includes a number of provisions aimed at improving services to students on campus such as enhanced campus crime reporting, a new campus-based child care program and streamlining financial aid procedures.I am also pleased that teacher education and recruitment received a boost in this bill by the adoption of a loan forgiveness program for new teachers and strong teaching training partnerships. As we continue to work on this bipartisan bill, I hope that we can continue our efforts to resolve issues regarding loan consolidation interest rates, guarantee agencies, and the National Board for Teacher Certification.Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my hope that we will unanimously reject attempts to undermine this bipartisan bill through the introduction of a divisive anti-affirmative action amendment. The Riggs amendment has received universal condemnation among all those who care deeply about expanding educational opportunities for all Americans. Students, colleges, civil rights groups, editorial boards and women's groups across this country have urged us to reject this giant leap backwards.Last night, Secretary Riley and Attorney General Reno sent an urgent message to Congress expressing their strongest possible opposition to this very dangerous amendment. They would urge the President to veto H.R. 6 if the Riggs amendment is adopted. I hope that all Members will reject this reckless amendment that is designed to torpedo passage of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:06:05.393844,2015-03-16 18:06:05.393844,House,HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998,1998-04-29,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-29/html/CREC-1998-04-29-pt1-PgH2510-8.htm,50,35,144,H2510-H2594,C000488,mr. clay
441,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and say thanks to a 31-year veteran educator in our public school system. The superintendent of Sikeston schools, Dr. Robert ``Bob'' Buchanan, has decided to move on to life's next challenge.Bob's retirement closes a remarkable chapter in Sikeston, Missouri's Public R-VI School District. As a teacher, coach, principal, and ultimately superintendent, Bob Buchanan has done it all in his 25 years in Sikeston. Moreover, he's been a positive influence on so many kids and touched many of their families over the past 31 years of dedication to education.Bob's long and winding road in education started in January 1966 when he first was hired as a social studies instructor in Harrisburg, AR. He then moved across the border to his home State to teach social studies in Bernie, MO--his original hometown--and just down the road in Charleston, MO, before planting new and, as we know today, deep roots in Sikeston in 1972.Bob Buchanan is a leader by example. His community service record is exemplary. For instance, Bob is a member of Sikeston's chamber of commerce quality of life committee. He's also on the physicians medical organization board, Missouri Delta medical center board, Sikeston area development council board, and in the mid-eighties, he served as chairman of the board of adjustment.Bob also knows that you must keep learning in life so that you're prepared for the next challenge or hurdle. His personal achievements in his academic pursuits are impressive. After graduating from Bernie High School in 1961, Bob graduated from Arkansas State University with a bachelor of science in education. He earned his master in education administration from Southeast Missouri State University in my hometown of Cape Girardeau in 1971. He graduated with honors 10 years later in 1981 with a specialist in education administration from Southeast Missouri State. Then, in 1987, he earned his doctor of philosophy from the Department of Educational Leadership at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Remember, most of these scholastic achievements came about in his spare time because Bob's full-time job was educating our children and helping to provide them a better, brighter future.Although this will be the last school year for Bob as superintendent of Sikeston schools, I'm sure folks will still find him going to every Bulldog game he and his wife Glenda can attend. Most importantly, I hope that the enthusiastic spirit and drive for excellence that Dr. Buchanan brings to the classrooms under his charge lives on for future generations. Bob Buchanan will be missed, but I truly believe his legacy will live on.,2015-03-16 18:06:05.549927,2015-03-16 18:06:05.549927,Extensions,DR.

442,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.Mr. Speaker, this motion would instruct the conferees to oppose the Senate amendment offered by Senator Lott that reneges on last year's agreement to fund the Clinton-Clay class size reduction plan.Last year we made a $1.2 billion down payment on a plan to help communities hire 100,000 new, well- qualified teachers over the next 7 years. All across this country, parents and students who are facing overcrowded classrooms are counting on Congress' commitment to reduce class sizes.The Lott amendment reneges on this commitment, and cynically pits one group of parents against another for money that Congress has already designated to be spent for class size reduction.All major education groups oppose this insidious attack on the class size reduction plan. The National Parents and Teachers Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the Chief States School Officers and the National Education Association, even Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania, according to press accounts, opposes the Lott amendment because it jeopardizes passage of the Ed-Flex bill.Finally, Mr. Speaker, I believe President Clinton would veto a bill that undermines funding for class size reduction. These new teachers are needed in the early grades, to reduce class size to no more than 18 children. Achieving the goal of 100,000 new teachers will ensure that every child receives personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning, and is prepared to read by the end of the third grade.Department of Education data shows that students in smaller classes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana and Tennessee outperformed their counterparts in larger classes. A study of Tennessee's Project Star found that students in smaller classes in Grades K through 3 earned much higher scores on basic skills tests. Based on this solid record of achievement, the Clinton-Clay class size reduction initiative should be granted a long-term authorization.Mr. Speaker, this motion further instructs the conferees to insist that additional funding be appropriated for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. Rather than forcing one vital program to compete for funds against another, we should instead pursue a greater overall investment in public education. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this motion and, by doing so, give both the class size reduction initiative and IDEA the opportunity to be funded at an appropriate level.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:06:05.673021,2015-03-16 18:06:05.673021,House,APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 800, EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-23/html/CREC-1999-03-23-pt1-PgH1549.htm,46,8,145,H1549-H1556,C000488,mr. clay

I am also grateful to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for the great work he has done on this committee for so many years, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to serve from our State with him and appreciate his commitment to this debate and his commitment to better education. I think that is what this debate is about. I think this bill, the base bill, provides that. Certainly the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) just mentioned appropriately the importance of quality teachers in the early grades. But I think quality teachers are important throughout the process.What this legislation does is allow ways to enhance the quality of teachers. It really decides where that decision is going to be made, whether that decision is going to be made in Washington, whether the decision as to what a local school district needs is made here on the floor of the Congress and here in the Halls of the bureaucracy in Washington or whether it is made in the school district, whether it is made in the principal's office in conjunction with the teacher and the school board and parents. I think they can best make those decisions. This bill is another step in that direction. Certainly reducing class size is an option here. But so is better education and special education. More funding for special education teachers, more mentoring, more teacher quality, all of those things have the potential to have great impact in different situations in different districts. We do not know here.The gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) mentioned earlier that in Delaware they are already down to 17 students as the maximum in a class in elementary. But there are certainly things I am confident in Delaware that they need, that they have not done all they need to do. Simply because they have made the steps already to reduce class size does not mean we should penalize people in that State from being able to do other things that enhance quality of education. I believe this bill does that. I am grateful that it is on the floor today. I intend to vote for it and encourage my colleagues not to be for the substitute.,2015-03-16 18:06:05.794100,2015-03-16 18:06:05.794100,House,TEACHER EMPOWERMENT ACT,1999-07-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-20/html/CREC-1999-07-20-pt1-PgH5856-2.htm,103,102,145,H5856-H5919,B000575,mr. blunt

445,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,I thank the manager.Mr. President, there have been numerous times that I have come to the Senate floor to say--and I come, once again, to repeat--that education is a national priority, but it is an obligation and responsibility of those at the State and local level. The education of our children has traditionally been--and ought to be in the future--carried out and implemented at the local level.I remember a couple of years ago when we were talking about Federal control that one of my colleagues, who is now no longer with us, was in a debate with a representative in the Department of Education. The Department of Education person said: I care just as much about your children and their needs and their operations in school and their success as you do, to which he replied: Well, that's great. Do you know their names? No. Do you know what their scores are? No. Do you know what their challenges are? No. Do you know where their schools are? No.The simple fact is that none of us here in Washington, no matter how much we are concerned about education in general and children in general, can know what the problems are and what the challenges are and how best to meet those challenges for students in each local school district throughout this Nation.I think we would all say that each child is different. Each school district is different. Each school is different. I think for that and other good reasons the Federal role in education has been a limited one, and I believe it should be. The underlying bill before us--S. 1--recognizes the nature and the scope of this role. The legislation creates a leadership role for the Federal Government in encouraging States to adopt commonsense systems based upon standards, measurements, and accountability. The underlying bill as reported out of our committee did not attempt to micromanage the local schools and classrooms.S. 1 also would give us the opportunity to redefine how we measure success. For too long, many of my colleagues here have supported throwing more and more money at education. And the Washington-based education establishment generally has determined our success in education programs based on the dollars spent--not on the academic achievements, not on the progress, and not on what our children are learning in school to be better prepared for their role in this increasingly complex and competitive society.If more money were the answer, we wouldn't be debating this bill because we wouldn't have the problem. We have poured more and more Federal money into education, and the academic achievement of our students has been level or in some cases it has fallen behind.In pouring more money into public education, we have gone to great lengths to detail precisely how those teachers--the men and women who know the names of the child in their classroom, and know what his or her problems are, more and more they are being told what to do by Washington.According to the Education Commission of the States:In the 1999-2000 budget, the federal government spent almost $44 billion on elementary and secondary education programs. This funding was spread across 35 different education programs in 15 different federal departments.We did a little research a couple years ago and found out there are over 760 education programs. It was that proliferation of good ideas from Washington that led me at the time to propose what we call the Direct Check For Education, to combine some of those biggest programs, cut the redtape, send it back to the school districts, and tell the school districts these are all things we think you ought to consider but do not require them to dot every i and cross every t, jump through the hoops, and fill out forms and fill out reports and play ``Mother May I'' with the Federal Government.All of these programs that exist today were started with good intentions, and they have gotten more money. Look at the money. Shown on this chart are the appropriations for ESEA programs in billions of dollars. Starting in 1990, it looks as if, oh, around $7 billion was spent, and now it has gone up to, oh, I would say close to $380 billion.This shows what has happened in the average national scale math scores for 9-year-olds. That is measured on the chart with the green line. It is a flat line. If that were a line on a key chart in a hospital measuring the heartbeat of the patient, it would say the patient is dead. All the money has produced no appreciable benefits. That is the math scores.Maybe we can look at another chart to see if we got any better results. How have we done in reading? This chart has the appropriations for ESEA programs in billions of dollars. It is the same type of chart as the last one. It shows the national 4th grade reading scores: a flat line, no life in the patient. We are not getting any better. We are spending more money to do no better.I am afraid we are about to hijack S. 1 and turn it into a replay of the same kind of Federal micromanagement and Federal direction of education that has managed to use a whole lot of money without getting any results.These Federal programs--the Education Commission of the States says 35; I say over 760--have gotten us burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. The folks at the local level--whether they be parents or teachers or school board members or administrators--say they have less and less control. Jobs of our teachers and administrators are harder than they should be. We have eroded the opportunity for creativity and motivation.I don't know how many of you have taken the opportunity to do what I have done in Missouri. Over the last 3 years, I have traveled throughout the State--in the metropolitan areas, the suburban areas, the rural areas--and I have met with representatives of teachers, of school board members, of administrators. I have asked: What is the problem here? And too many of them have come back to say: We are spending our time as glorified grantsmen, trying to get more money from the Federal Government, trying to jump through the hoops, trying to do what the Federal Government wants us to do. We don't have the time to prepare our lessons and to prepare our students for the education they need for a lifetime.This is a serious problem. This is what the teachers, the administrators, the school board members are telling us throughout my State. It comes through loud and clear, and it is on a bipartisan basis. From the most conservative Republicans to the most liberal Democrats, the people in Missouri, who are involved at the local school level, tell us there is far too much time, effort, and energy wasted on complying with Federal dictates, Federal mandates.Some of our schools say that, although the Federal Government only provides an average of about 5 percent--I guess in Missouri it is a little less than the national average of the dollars going to education--it, in effect, controls about 50 percent of what is done because these Federal mandates and these Federal dictates--all these good ideas that went into these programs--tell the local schools how they ought to handle the programs they would otherwise be doing to educate their kids. And most of them say, well over 50 percent of the redtape and the headache and the requirements and the hassle they go through comes from the Federal Government.How can we afford to keep spending Federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing it for years if it is not achieving any success? I do not think we can. I do not think we should stand for it. I have talked to too many parents and teachers, school board members, community and business leaders who say: Our children deserve better. This country deserves better.Over the past several years, I have opposed the creation of specific new programs and their dictates on the style of their education, even these amendments that have been offered in good faith. These amendments were good ideas, if we had taken our good ideas and ran for membership on a school board. I am sure many of my colleagues could make great contributions if they were on the school board in Mexico, MO, or the R-6 school district or the St. Louis city school board or the Jefferson City school board, but we are not.The problem is, there are different needs and different challenges in Missouri, in Washington, in Arizona, in Maine, or in Florida. When we pass a law, when we pass a dictate or a requirement, we do not know how that is going to impact the kids who are the ones who have to be taught. We may understand education in general, but there are educational needs that are specific and direct in each school district as the individual student involved.I cannot believe, if my colleagues went back home, spent some time, saddled up the horses, went out and just rode the circuit, that you wouldn't hear the same things. I know, first hand. Our State has some of the best teachers, the best principals, superintendents, and school board members in the country. They are outstanding people. They are really concerned.You think we are concerned about education. Well, we were concerned about education last week and will be this week, but we have to be concerned about the budget, we have to be concerned about tax policy, and we are going to be concerned about energy policy.These dedicated men and women are spending their lifetime dedicated to one thing; that is, teaching our children. What do the people who are actually involved in education have to say?The superintendent of Springfield, MO, public schools said:. . . the amount of paperwork that the federal government causes local school districts to engage in is often overwhelming. The extra effort and time often reduces productive classroom time and energy that could better be spent working directly with children.Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV school said:Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had in mind.From the Neosho, MO, R-5 school district:The individuals who are working most closely with the students are indeed the ones who can best decide how this money can be spent for the benefit of students' education.The superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County said:As head of a school district specializing in special education, I fully understand how my district's financial needs differ from other school district's needs. In order to best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those funds to the best use.The president of the board of education of the Blue Springs, MO, school district said:Without local control, the focus is taken away from the needs specific to the children in each school system.But I think maybe the superintendent of the Taneyville, MO, R-II school district sums it up well:I feel that State and Federal government has tied our school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school does this; pull it another way and the school does that. School systems and communities are as different from one another as individual people are different. What works for one will not work for another.I offer those because that is the kind of information all of us need as we move forward on any kind of education bill, certainly one as important as the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. My colleagues haven't been in a position to listen to those people and ask them questions directly, but I suggest to them, if they go home and ask questions, they will hear the same, with similar eloquence and similar heartfelt concern, in their States.To me the issue is simple: We must give our States and localities the flexibility to utilize the limited amount of Federal resources as they see fit and hold them accountable in the form of academic achievement. We must recognize and reward States and localities that succeed in improving academic achievement. There also should be consequences for States and localities that fail.We have a choice between having Washington, DC, control our schools and the local level. Who is most likely to waste money? There is no contest there. Unfortunately, we have demonstrated in Washington collectively that no matter how good our ideas, how well intentioned our efforts are to provide direction and counseling and hope for schools, we may not be doing the right job; we may be causing them more problem.A little girl hustling to school--she was late for school--said a little prayer that she would get to school on time. She went about another half block and got going too fast and fell down on her face. She offered up another little prayer: I would like you to help me to get to school, but don't push so hard. I fell down.Sometimes we are pushing a little too hard. Sometimes what we try to do to help the people who are trying to deliver education try to uplift and empower our children pushes them down on their face. I think it is time that we consolidate those programs, that we take all these great revenues and give parents a say. Let school boards determine the policy, let administrators know how to run their school, and let teachers who know the names and the problems and the opportunities and the potential of each child make those educational decisions.S. 1, the underlying bill, consolidates a myriad of Federal programs into a set of programs designed to allow States and local school districts to make decisions on their own, to determine their priorities, recognizing that education reform will take place in the classroom, not because of all of the wonderful, great ideas we have in Washington, DC. The underlying concept of S. 1 is the right way to go.Amendments on class size are absolutely unnecessary. Class size reduction is an option in S. 1's larger, more flexible program for improving the quality of classroom teaching. It should be an option, not a mandate.Let me ask this question: Has it been shown that a fifth grade class must have only so many children in it to be successful? I have talked to a lot of administrators who say the most important thing for teaching that fifth grade class and each child in it is to make sure the quality of the teacher is good. If we can't come up with two quality teachers, all we do, in splitting up the class, is say to those children who go with a less qualified teacher that they don't get as good an education.What if the school district has already devoted its money to reducing class size, used its local funds? What they need is better pay to keep those teachers there.On classroom funding, are we going to say: You can only use this money to hire more teachers? What if the principal said: I have some great teachers, but they are going to go into the private sector if I don't give them a pay increase? How does that make sense for us to say to every school district in the Nation: Thou shalt hire more teachers? It doesn't make sense to me.Local school districts are best equipped to determine what they need. Many have already reduced class size where they thought necessary. They might have done that at the expense of some other things: Teacher pay, technology, class books. Maybe they need professional development for the teachers they have. How do we know? I will guarantee you, we don't know. We can't know for every school district in the Nation. That is why we ought not be mandating that Federal dollars be spent for a purpose that may or may not be the top priority need of that district.Mandating specific resources for class size reduction really takes money off the table for other schools that have already addressed that specific issue. As I said earlier, they may have decided that professional development for their teachers to improve the quality of teaching is more important to obtain academic success for the students and schools.We always deal with limited budgets. There is not going to be an unlimited source of money going into anything we need. The question is how best we spend the money we have. All of us agree that a good, quality education is our top national priority. We can't say we are going to have all the specific programs and we are going to meet every need of every school district because State and local funds still cover at least 90 percent--in most States more--of education funding. We are not going to replace that. We shouldn't because we didn't run for this office to be a national school board.The President and the Secretary of Education are men deeply committed to education, but they are not good superintendents of schools or principals or even teachers, in this instance, because they have to deal with all the schools and they can't know all the kids' names.The American public is and should be interested in the debate in Washington because they overwhelmingly believe that good education for our children is a top priority. But they also know what really matters is what goes on in the schools and the classrooms around the country. As much as we like to argue among ourselves, what is said in this Chamber or even in the other body is not going to drive the education of a student or make sure that student is better educated. That depends upon a teacher and the school in which that child studies.Individuals on one side of this debate believe that the Olympians on the hill, those of us in Washington with fine titles, those of us with national responsibilities in the Congress or those in the Education Department, a group of very concerned individuals, know what is best for the folks down in the valley.I happen to be on the side who believe that the great ideas, the accomplishments, the successes that are going to make our children better educated for the future, that are going to help them meet the challenges of this wonderful but challenging century are going to be made by the folks in the valley, the men and women who staff our schools, who are the teachers, administrators, superintendents, principals who run the school boards, and who are the parents who, above all, are the ones with the greatest stake in the education of their children. I hope this body does not hijack S. 1 and make it into another system of categorical grants: Jump through this hoop and you will get some dollars. But then you will have to fill out reports and check in with Washington to see how you used them, and then you will have to file more reports, or you can jump through this hoop if you make a successful application. And if you jump through the right hoops and somebody in Washington agrees that it is OK, then you have to follow up with more reports and redtape and forms and tell them what you did. I don't think that is the way we ought to be going on education.I urge my colleagues, as we look at these amendments before us, to ask these basic questions: Is this amendment or provision going to enable somebody who is teaching children in a school in my State to do a better job? Is it going to be across the board? Is it going to enable every teacher in every school district? Or is it only going to affect a few school districts, where our priority happens to be that school's priority?Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to rethink how we are going in terms of setting up too many hoops for schools to jump through. We want to see better education, but Federal hoops are not the way to get there.I thank the Chair and yield the floor.,2015-03-16 18:06:06.050311,2015-03-16 18:06:06.050311,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT,2001-05-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-14/html/CREC-2001-05-14-pt1-PgS4858-2.htm,65,31,147,S4858-S4880,B000611,mr. bond
446,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, as a member of the conference committee, we spent nearly 6 months crafting this bill. I am pleased to rise in support of this landmark legislation which leaves no child behind.As many of my colleagues have already mentioned, this bill provides the most comprehensive education reform since 1965. I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the leader on our side, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, and the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. Their tireless work to bring this bill to the Senate has placed comprehensive education reform within reach of all students across the country.Too many children in America are segregated by low expectations, illiteracy, and self-doubt. In a constantly changing world that demands increasingly complex skills from its workforce, children are being left behind. Over the years, we have empowered the Federal Government and faceless bureaucrats while burying our educators and schools in regulation, redtape, mandates, and endless paperwork. As a result, we have disenfranchised educators and slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation at the local level.At last count, the Federal Government had 760 different education programs operating within 39 different agencies, boards, and commissions. Each was launched as a step toward reform, but each new program comes with added regulation and paperwork.By one estimate, compliance consumes 50 million hours each year, the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employees just to process the forms. Ask the teacher who has to deal with 760 programs, or the administrator who has to handle it, just how much this detailed reform and direction from Washington has helped them focus on their children. In my State they will say ``not one bit.''Today, nearly 70 percent of low-income fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level. Our high school seniors trail students of most industrialized nations on international math tests. Nearly a third of our college freshmen must take a remedial course before they are able to begin college level courses. This is why President Bush has chosen education reform as a cornerstone of his administration.This conference report reflects an agenda that President Bush outlined during his first days in office. It emphasizes flexibility, local control, accountability, literacy, and parental involvement. I am honored to have had a hand in shaping that policy. Parental involvement, early childhood, and parents as teachers are issues I have worked with a long time. I am pleased the principles of my direct check for education were included in the legislation. Over the years, I have worked with Missouri educators to develop the direct check approach to education reform, which consolidates Federal education programs, cuts Federal strings and paperwork, and sends the money directly to local school districts.Like my direct check proposal, this conference report recognizes that educational reform and progress will take place in the classrooms in America, not in Washington, DC. This report consolidates a myriad of existing Federal programs and allows States and local school districts to make decisions on their own, to determine their priorities. By reducing the mandates, as well as the costly and time-consuming paperwork that local school districts must endure to obtain Federal grants and funding, parents and teachers are empowered to take back control of educating our Nation's children.To me, the issue is simple. We must empower our States and local school districts with flexibility to utilize the limited amount of Federal resources as they best see fit to educate our children. This conference report does just that. Local schools will immediately be given the flexibility they need, where they are most needed, because a school in Joplin, MO, may have different needs than one in Hannibal, Kansas City, St. Louis, or Boonville, MO.Some schools need new teachers. Others may need new textbooks or computers, or wish to begin an after-school program.We simply cannot continue to ask teachers and local schools to meet higher expectations without empowering them with the freedom and flexibility to do the job. This legislation strikes a delicate balance. It keeps the Federal Government out of the day-to-day operations of local schools; gives States and school districts more authority and freedom; and requires performance in return.Education, while a national priority, remains a local responsibility. I believe that those who know the names of the students are better at making decisions than bureaucrats at the Department of Education. Parents, teachers, local school boards are the key to true education reform, not big government, Washington-based educational bureaucracy. In addition to giving local schools more control, I am pleased this conference report recognizes parental involvement and increases resources to our very successful Parents as Teachers Program which we hope to provide to every State in the Nation as well as foreign countries. It strengthens accountability, it provides the necessary funds to attract and retain quality teachers, and develops literacy programs to guarantee all students will be able to read by the third grade.With its emphasis on the child rather than the bureaucracy, this legislation offers an opportunity to make real progress in our schools.The great Missourian Mark Twain said: Out of public schools grows the greatness of a nation.One-sixth of the American population is enrolled in public schools. The content and quality of their education will determine the character of our country.I thank the managers of this bill for their courtesy to me as well as for their great work over the 6 months in bringing this conference report to the floor.,2015-03-16 18:06:06.183377,2015-03-16 18:06:06.183377,Senate,NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT OF 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT,2001-12-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-12-18/html/CREC-2001-12-18-pt1-PgS13365-8.htm,176,68,147,S13365-S13422,B000611,mr. bond
447,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, here we are again on another continuing resolution some 11, 12, or 13 days into the fiscal year; and we have not begun to finish our work. I am very disappointed that we come to the floor again to debate another continuing resolution simply to keep the government going. We should have had all of the appropriation bills done 12 days ago.This Republican Congress has been so busy throwing money at things, helping candidates, and our time and our energy have been so taken up by the contrived 90-10 scheme put out by the other side, that we have been unable to do our most basic work. My biggest fear is that in all of this, education, which is the most important challenge and issue facing our country, is being shortchanged. We should not be taking another full week in which we drift aimlessly and squander, as Republicans would have us do, key opportunities on education.So we are going to vote for this resolution, but we are putting the Republican leadership on notice. Until we have an opportunity to deal with education, this is the end of the line on comfortable stop-gap measures that keep the government open week by week. Democrats believe that education is priority number one, two and three.I know that many of my colleagues believe that we are talking about the bare minimum on education; much more important an agenda than we have had on any other issue. We need to give every child the time and attention they need from adults and the life opportunities they deserve. The three items that Democrats believe are the keys to education are the following: tax cuts for school construction, hiring new teachers and reducing class size, and funding key programs like after-school and Pell Grants.This is the bare minimum of what we need to do. And, unfortunately, while Republicans have been on their spending spree, coming up with false budgets to reduce the debt, education has been shoved to the side by this Congress with a set of priorities that are skewed, to say the least. We want a reasonable, bipartisan tax credit for school construction, and we want funding for emergency repairs. But Republicans are starving that priority because, while they talk about their commitment to education, they do very little to back up that commitment with the proper resources and the proper commitment to those resources.We want in Labor-HHS funding that is dedicated to hiring new qualified teachers and reducing class size. But our friends on the other side have created loopholes in the bill so big that the money could be spent for anything.Finally, as part of this first step this year, we support funding for after-school programs so that our children can get the time and attention they need to become productive, functional law-abiding citizens. Listen to this. We have over 2 million people in jail in this country. They do not pay taxes, they do not vote, they do not raise their families, they do not give to charity. They are not functional citizens. They cost us about $40,000 per person per year to hold them.At the same time, we have 2 million jobs in this country that we cannot fill. We are about to pass an H-1B law that would let more foreign immigrants come into the country to fill these high-tech jobs, and all of us support the legislation because we need to fill the jobs.The answer to those two stark contradictory facts is that we are not doing a good enough job with educating and raising our children so we prevent them from going to jail, so we get them to take these jobs and give them the education and the mental ability that they need to do it. We have to do better and we cannot wait until next year to do better. The opportunity is in front of us now, by giving our public schools and our families the resources and the incentives that they need to lift up every child.So let us stop squandering our opportunities and let us work together in a bipartisan fashion in these next few days on the most important priority for the American people. Let us get our work done, but let us do it in a bipartisan way. Let us stop spending our time on naming post offices and passing resolutions that have little import or meaning. Let us stop spending our time buying another week of time so that we can do work that we should have done 3 months ago. Let us get to work in a bipartisan way and serve the needs of the education of our children in this bill.Democrats will no longer support continuing resolutions to keep the government running for weeks on end. We will support a bipartisan education bill that finally helps the children of this country.,2015-03-16 18:06:06.317472,2015-03-16 18:06:06.317472,House,FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-10-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-12/html/CREC-2000-10-12-pt1-PgH9821-3.htm,127,7,146,H9821-H9826,G000132,mr. gephardt
448,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Why am I opposed to national testing? Mr. President, we must remember that any movement toward national control of education savages principles that we as Americans hold dear: parental authority and control, teachers who are free to teach core subject matter and school boards that are responsive to their communities, not held captive by distant bureaucrats.President Clinton's proposal for national testing of our children is an example of such an attempt at a federal power grab. The President wants to move power out of the hands of parents and school boards and into the hands of Washington bureaucrats.America resists that for a number of important reasons, and these are the reasons to oppose federalized national tests.Parental involvement is the most important factor in a child's educational success, and national tests would undermine the ability of parents to play a meaningful role in the educational decisions of their children.During my time as Governor of Missouri, and through my work with the Education Commission of the States, learned that the single most operative condition in student educational achievement is the involvement of parents. Study after study has proven the significance of parental involvement in their child's education.We should not disengage parents with a federalized national testing system. Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in educational success.Experience has shown that local control is a key factor in educational success. As a former Governor who made education a top policy priority, I learned first-hand that local control is needed to create educational programs that respond to the needs of local communities and that stimulate success.National tests will lead to a national curriculum. There is wide consensus among teachers, administrators, and education experts that ``what gets tested is what gets taught.''So, if you determine a test, you determine the curriculum.A national curriculum is detrimental because it eliminates the participation of parents and local schools--the key elements of success. It would do so inevitably. As a result, they key elements of success--parents, schoolteachers, and local decision-making--would be missing in our educational systems throughout the country.Lynne Cheney, former Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, reminds us that previous attempts at federal standards have been disastrous.She points to the politically correct federal history standards which were unanimously rejected in the Senate.Cheney also points to the English/language arts standards, which were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having invested more than $1 million.The final exam on the Clinton plan for federally controlled testing will come on the Labor/OHS/Education appropriations bill. This Congress--and more importantly, the American people--will be watching very carefully to see how the Administration performs on this issue that affects the future of our children. I will do everything in my power to protect the ability of parents, teachers, and local schools to be involved in the education of their children by participating in the development of school curriculum, standards, and testing.So I commend this bill to the President. This is an important bill. It would advance substantially the interests of our students. I thank the sponsors for their outstanding work.I look forward to sending to the President an appropriations bill which would curtail the potential of any money being wasted at the Federal level by imposing inappropriate federalized tests upon local school districts. These tests would curtail the ability of local officials to make the kinds of decisions that are necessary for us to have the kind of school quality that we need in order to survive in the next century.With that in mind, I thank the sponsor of this legislation and commend him for the outstanding work he has done by stepping forward for America's schoolchildren, and I look forward to the opportunity of working together again to make sure that as we protect the options of parents and local officials to educate their children, we best serve this great land and future generations.I thank the Chair.Gentlemen: We are grateful to the two of you for taking the lead on requiring that testing of students remain at the state and local level. The administration's proposal to control student testing at the federal level necessarily would result in government control of the curriculum. Stopping this central government control of student testing is a very important part of our Republican plan to return our schools to the control of the parents and teachers at the local level. We have worked with you and voted with you to pass a federal testing prohibition bill in the House and to add an amendment to H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools. Obviously, since this bill is under the threat of a veto by the administration and a filibuster by Senate Democrats, it does not serve our interests to pursue the ban on federal testing in this bill. Therefore, in order to ensure that Congress will pass and send to the President a ban on federal testing, you have our commitment to support inclusion of your testing prohibition language (H.R. 2846/Amendment 2300 to H.R. 2646) in the base test of the FY 1999 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. This language will be maintained through floor action and the conference committee process. You have our commitment that this bill will not leave the Congress without a testing provision that you find to be satisfactory. If for some reason the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill does not make it to the President's desk, then we will support efforts to include this provision in any Continuing Resolution(s), or other ``must pass'' legislation in both bodies.

449,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the issue of education for a moment and say that in my view, and I think in all Democrats' views, and I hope in many Republicans' views, education is the most important issue in front of our country. I was recently talking to some people from Silicon Valley, and they told me that they are right now unable to hire the people that they need. One executive told me he has had an ad in the paper all over the country to find people who are computer literate and can work in their plants, and he has not gotten an answer for the ad.He is now going to high schools because he needs college graduates. He is literally going to high schools and trying to find well-qualified high school students to try to draft them into his company before they can go to college. It is kind of like with basketball players that are drafted into the pros before they can go to college.I have labor unions in St. Louis that are going into the high schools and recruiting young people to come to apprenticeship programs, something that has not happened in our country, certainly in St. Louis, in probably 40 years, maybe longer. We have a 4.9 percent unemployment rate nationally. In some States we have a 2-percent unemployment rate right now tonight in June 1997.The great shortage in the country is not tax breaks for people who have done very well and are doing well. The great shortage in the country is mentally capable human beings who can take the productive jobs in our companies and create more economic growth and productivity so that our economy does even better in the future. And so the reason the President feels so strongly about these education tax cuts is they go to the heart of what is most needed in our country. And to go back to our people that we have talked about tonight, we, the kids in the middle class, kids trying to get in the middle class need tax breaks in order to go to college and to go to community college so they can get the mental capabilities, so they can be productive citizens and take these jobs that our corporations so desperately are looking for talent to fill.When the President said that he would not sign a tax bill, that does not have $35 billion of education tax cuts, he said it because of that fact. Our bill has $37 billion of tax cuts for education. The Republican bill has $22 billion of tax cuts for education. It is not going to be signed by this President because it should not be signed.Again, the No. 1 need in the country is education, education, education is what we need. And we need our tax cuts to go to people so they can get education.When I was a young person, my dad was a milk truck driver in St. Louis. We were of those lower middle income families. My mom was a secretary. Every month they would take their money and put it in a savings account so my brother and I could go to college, the first ones in our family that had been able to go to college. When we finally got into college, we had to borrow money from the church, Third Baptist Church in St. Louis.I will never forget, my mother and I went down and saw the pastor of the church and we asked for a loan. They had a little scholarship fund, and they gave us a loan so that I could pay my tuition at the university. We did not have tax cuts then. And we did not have student loans, and we did not have Pell grants then. It was a long time ago. I am getting up there. But the only way we could do it is if we go to the church and borrow the money. And tuition at Northwestern University, where I went, was $1,500 a year.What does a family today who is earning $25,000 and $20,000 and $30,000 and $17,000 do to get their child even to community college or to State college, much less a private university that might cost 5 or 10 or 20 or $30,000 a year?When we are talking about this conversation that we are having, I say to the gentlewoman from Houston, with the American people tonight, and I hope we will have over the next 48 hours, this is what is at stake. It is whether or not the kids of this country who come from middle income and lower middle income and poor working American homes will have the ability to go borrow the money and get the money together to go to college so they can be productive citizens. That is what is at stake.There are not enough churches out there to do what happened to me. I hope there are some and I hope they can give loans to kids like I got a loan, but I am sure that there are not enough out there to get this done.This is a big deal. It is a big deal for the future of the American economy and the American people. I hope and pray that we can get this point across to the American people in these next 48 hours, and they will stay tuned in, as the gentlewoman from Houston has said, and that we will get their attention and they will respond. They will pick up the phone and they will write or they will send e-mail or they will send a letter or they will go to the office of their Congressperson, whether they are Republican or Democrat and say, we want a tax bill that helps average families and helps education and really helps the future of this country.I thank the gentleman.,2015-03-16 18:06:06.728765,2015-03-16 18:06:06.728765,House,DEMOCRATIC TAX CUT PROPOSAL,1997-06-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-24/html/CREC-1997-06-24-pt1-PgH4314.htm,90,19,143,H4314-H4320,G000132,mr. gephardt
450,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prohibit the Federal Government from developing and/or imposing new national individualized tests on students across the country.During his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton announced his intentions to establish national tests for students in fourth grade reading and eighth grade mathematics. Without waiting for congressional authority, the Department of Education surged ahead and began development of uniform national tests, with plans to administer them starting in 1999. In August, the Department announced the award of a $13 million contract for its national testing initiative, and plans to spend an estimated $50.6 million under the contract from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2001, including $12.3 million for fiscal year 1998.In response, Representative Bill Goodling, chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, offered an amendment in the House which prohibits the expenditure of fiscal year 1998 funds for a new national testing program. While the Senate failed to consider fully and vote on the Goodling approach during its debate of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, the House embraced the Goodling amendment, approving it by a resounding vote of 295 to 125.The House vote sends a clear and strong signal that Congress should prohibit Federal funds for national testing in education. In fact, the alliance of members from both sides of the political spectrum demonstrates the universal concern that the administration's proposal is besieged by problems. Here are just a few of the many reasons why national tests should be opposed:First, education experts such as Dr. Donald J. Senese, former Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement during the Reagan administration, warn that national testing will lead to a national curriculum.Second, Lynne Cheney, former chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, reminds us that Federal efforts to set standards and tests have been disastrous. She points to the politically correct Federal history standards and the English-language arts standards, which were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding for them after having spent more than $1 million in taxpayer funds.Third, the proposed math test is steeped in the new, unproven whole math or fuzzy math philosophy, which encourages students to rely on calculators, discourages basic math skills, and has resulted in declines in math performance. For example, the median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 DODDS students one year after the Defense Department introduced whole math dropped 9 points for third graders, 12 for fourth graders, 11 for fifth graders, 10 for sixth graders, 10 for seventh graders, and 4 for eighth graders.Finally, Federal testing takes away local control and parental involvement. The Federal Government should not impose its will on school boards, parents, and teachers about the education of their children. Rather, education should be controlled by school boards in local communities, where parents have the greatest opportunity to be involved in the education of their child, by participating in the development of school curriculum and testing. After all, research confirms that parental involvement is the single most important element in educating our children.Mr. President, the big losers from national tests will be students, parents, teachers, and local school boards. Once Federal exams are in place, teachers and schools will teach the test. In other words, they will change their classes to fit the Federal tests, in order to get higher scores. Textbooks and instructional materials will follow suit, even in areas that attempt to avoid national tests. As a result, Washington bureaucrats who design the tests will shape local curriculum decisions. National control of curriculum is absolutely unacceptable to me. Once the Federal Government is using tests to shape curriculum, parental control through local school boards will be doomed.Who should control local education? I believe our schools should remain under the control of parents, teachers, and school boards, in cooperation with the States. The flawed whole math approach which brought major losses in computation test scores demonstrates the central threat in national control: When the bureaucrats make a mistake, everybody pays, from coast to coast.Parents are looking to Congress to protect their right and their ability to shape the education of their children. A national testing system would deprive parents of this vital opportunity. As Members of Congress, we can show our support for education by saying ``no'' to national testing and ``yes'' to parental control of their children's learning.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.,2015-03-16 18:06:06.851853,2015-03-16 18:06:06.851853,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1997-09-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-24/html/CREC-1997-09-24-pt1-PgS9887.htm,129,393,143,S9887-S9897,A000356,mr. ashcroft
451,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, today I am introducing the Deposit Restricted Qualified Tuition Programs Act of 2009. My bill establishes an avenue for those wanting to save for the college education of a child, grandchild or other related individual, to do so in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured deposit. At the present time, savers can only access the 529 college savings program through a securities based plan and my bill would not change this avenue.However, following the recent crash of the stock market, many savers saw their accounts drop in value by fifty percent or more and as such are reluctant to place any more monies in a securities based plan. Furthermore, many small savers can find investing in securities based products both complex and intimidating. A FDIC insured deposit option would provide guaranteed principal return and a guaranteed return on the deposit, all from a commercial bank that the saver likely has a relationship with. This proposed legislation will help families across the United States save in a safe, sound and simple manner for their children and grandchildren's college education.Again Madam Speaker, this bill does not make any changes to the current 529 college savings program nor the current delivery system of the program through a securities based plan. It simply adds another 529 college savings program delivery option through an FDIC insured deposit.,2015-03-16 18:10:25.360624,2015-03-16 18:10:25.360624,Extensions,DEPOSIT RESTRICTED QUALIFIED TUITION PROGRAMS ACT OF 2009,2009-09-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-17/html/CREC-2009-09-17-pt1-PgE2305-3.htm,132,0,155,E2305,C001061,mr. cleaver
452,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I appreciate the gentleman from Utah getting perhaps philosophically to the heart of this debate. Really, the question is are we going to go down the path. And if you take a look, there was a nation that we knew very well back just a few years ago, and the nation had this basic operating philosophy: the government will provide you with an education. The government will provide you with a job. The government will provide you with a house. The government will provide you with health care. And we see our own country. And that nation was called the Soviet Union which is now in the dust bin of history.Now we see our Nation providing housing, providing food, providing education, and now we are talking about health care. Now, this is a little different speed, though, because before when someone was hungry, the proposal was give them a food stamp, which I am not sure was very efficient, but it wasn't to federalize every grocery store and every farm in America.This proposal that we are talking about is different. This is saying that we are going to step right in and the government is going to take over one-fifth of the U.S. economy, and that is a pretty tall step to take.,2015-03-16 18:10:25.533733,2015-03-16 18:10:25.533733,House,HEALTH CARE,2009-09-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-16/html/CREC-2009-09-16-pt1-PgH9638-16.htm,131,59,155,H9638-H9646,A000358,mr. akin
453,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, when people get into the details of health care, I think they sometimes miss seeing the very big picture. The big picture here is that the Pelosi and the Democrat health care plan has this final destination, which is that it's going to be run by some czar or commissar in the Federal Government.I guess the question I have is: On what sense of faith is this decision made?Is it the efficiency of the Post Office, perhaps, that inspires them or the compassion of the IRS, or is it, perhaps, the Department of Energy that was created to make sure we wouldn't be dependent on foreign oil or, perhaps, the Department of Education, which was studied some years ago, and it was determined in the study that, if a foreign power had done what the Department of Education has done to America, it would be considered an act of war?Why do we want to destroy the health care system that 100 million Americans enjoy in order to just simply socialize it and to turn it over to some czar in Washington, D.C.?That's an act of faith that's just too hard to follow.,2015-03-16 18:10:25.691839,2015-03-16 18:10:25.691839,House,HEALTH CARE,2009-10-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-10-27/html/CREC-2009-10-27-pt1-PgH11819-4.htm,157,1,155,H11819,A000358,mr. akin
454,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, with an economic slowdown looming and the war in Iraq draining billions of dollars in public resources every week, a strong Federal budget will give families the help they need to weather tough times and prepare for a prosperous future.A budget that invests in America's future will direct federal funding to where it's needed most, especially health care, education, housing, nutrition, job training and other priorities that promote economic growth and expand opportunity.A budget resolution that invests in America's future will include bold new investments in high-quality, affordable health care; strong public education; infrastructure and the development of clean energy sources to end our dependence on foreign oil. It also means an end to the costly war in Iraq, and the repeal of President Bush's irresponsible tax breaks for those who don't need or want them. We should also be providing tax relief and help to struggling families and veterans; increase homeland security funding; and reject the President's cuts to our first responders.A budget that invests in America's future will succeed only with broad support in Congress.

Mr. Warren had a blacksmith shop which served as an informal gathering place for the local farmers. Mr. Warren's shop was named the county seat of the newly created County of Johnson. The township was named Warren's Burg, in honor of the blacksmith.Warrensburg citizens have many reasons to be proud of their city. One of these reasons is the city's excellent school system. With an enrollment of 3,200 students, the district is accredited with Distinction in Performance by the Missouri State Board of Education. Also, the city is home to Central Missouri State University, which has provided fine post secondary education for more than 130 years.Warrensburg also is home to many prominent businesses and organizations. EnerSys, GE Transportation Systems, Swisher Mower, Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity world headquarters and Carlyle Van Lines have all thrived in the city, and there are countless other businesses--small and large--that contribute to the economic well being of Warrensburg.Mr. Speaker, I wish to extend my congratulations to the citizens of Warrensburg, Missouri, for this outstanding accomplishment.

In my district, NEA and NEH grants have brought partnership projects such as the Coterie Theater and the Friends of Alvin Ailey's AileyCamp that help provide collaborative artist and youth activities which have enriched the local economy and educational experiences of our children.Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. Test results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores than other students.There is no jurisdiction for funding for the NEA at a level that is 30 percent below the 1994 level. Adopting the amendment before us would increase funding by $10 million for the NEA and $3.5 million for the NEH. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which would keep up with inflation.

This problem affects both urban and rural schools, but especially high-needs schools with large numbers of children below the poverty level.Teachers are saddled with the responsibility of educating our children in their classroom studies, teaching morals and values, and making them productive members of society. Our teachers are instrumental in influencing our children's development, and yet there is little acknowledgment or reward for this responsibility they carry.As the husband of a kindergarten teacher and the father of three, I understand that a teacher who remains in the classroom and has a passion for teaching is a great benefit to our children. We need to find ways to attract young professionals to teaching careers by offering incentives to keep them in the teaching profession and develop them into talented educators. H.R. 438 encourages those going into the teaching profession to stay in a career they are passionate about while affording them the financial ability to do so.Teachers are the foundation of our children's education and development, and, therefore, it is necessary to invest in the well-being of their careers.

462,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today in support of House Resolution 335, honoring the commitment of our Nation's Catholic Schools to excellence. Catholic schools continue to enrich the lives of our children by providing excellent education as well as spiritual enrichment.The numbers speak for themselves. Catholic schools boast a 95 percent graduation rate, with 83 percent of students continuing on to higher education. But the Catholic school experience fosters more than just scholastic excellence. Catholic schools provide spiritual guidance to students, instilling in them fundamental values that are crucial to the overall development of these students. Catholic schoolchildren gain an appreciation of the importance of family values, community service, and faith in their lives. This, in turn, shapes Catholic school students into leaders of tomorrow.I am proud of the Catholic schools in my district that continue to establish such high standards--Saint John LaLande in Blue Springs, Bishop Hogan Memorial in Chillicothe, Saint Andrew the Apostle in Gladstone, Saint Patrick and Saint Therese in Kansas City; Saint James in Liberty, Saint Gregory Barbarigo in Maryville, Saint Charles Borromeo in Oakview, Bishop LeBlond High School, Co-Cathedral, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Saint Francis Xavier, Saint James and Saint Patrick in Saint Joseph.Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the contributions of our Catholic schools and look forward to their continued achievement.,2015-03-16 18:10:26.820642,2015-03-16 18:10:26.820642,Extensions,HONORING CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2002-02-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-02-04/html/CREC-2002-02-04-pt1-PgE63.htm,6,0,148,E63,G000546,mr. graves
463,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention that a few weeks from now will be National Association of Insurance Women week.Professional insurance women constitute over 50 percent of those employed in our Nation's insurance industry. For that reason, the National Association of Insurance Women and its 400 local affiliates are dedicated to the development of leaders for the insurance industry.NAIW and its affiliates promote personal and professional development through education, networking and leadership opportunities to all women in the insurance business. Both national and local organizations continually strive to raise the standards of ethics, consumer education and customer service throughout the insurance industry.NAIW local affiliates are engaged in charitable causes to strengthen and enhance hundreds of communities throughout the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Professional insurance women have earned recognition for their many accomplishments in the economically vital insurance industry.It is important that we celebrate and honor the women who are performing such important and diverse roles throughout the risk and insurance industry. ,2015-03-16 18:10:26.952764,2015-03-16 18:10:26.952764,Senate,NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE WOMEN WEEK,2001-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-03/html/CREC-2001-05-03-pt1-PgS4241-4.htm,59,0,147,S4241,C001043,mrs. carnahan
464,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to vote and speak against this conference report and ask Members on both sides of the aisles to do the same thing. This is not a good budget for America.We did not get to vote the other night because we did not have two pages, but now that we have seen all of the pages, the problem was not the lack of the right pages. The problem with this budget is that it does not have the right numbers. It does not fulfill the priorities of the American people. It is a budget that is deficient in terms of fiscal responsibility and in terms of the right priorities that I think people have.In many ways, this budget is a definition of what we want the country to be in the next 10 years. So it is a momentous decision that we are making.I believe this is a day that we give up on fiscal responsibility. I thoroughly believe that if this budget is followed, that in the days ahead we will return to deficits.First of all, there is no cushion. The cushion that looks like is here is not here, and when the tax cuts go up, as they inevitably will, when other tax cuts that are not contemplated in this budget are actually passed, the deficits will start. We will invade Social Security and Medicare, which we said we did not want to do.We have had innumerable votes here on lockboxes, but I predict that if this budget is passed we will be into Social Security and Medicare.This is the day that we return to high deficits and high interest rates. Why in the world would we want to do that? For 20 years in this country all we ever talked about was deficits and what deficits meant to our ability to fund anything that people wanted to fund; what it did to high interest rates; what it did to high inflation. Now, with this budget, I believe we are back into deficits and back into invading Social Security and Medicare.This is the day that we give huge tax cuts to the wealthiest special interests in the country, and we cannot seem to figure out how to get a decent tax cut to the middle-income Americans who really need it. Again, half of the tax cuts contemplated here go to the top wage earners in our country, and there is not enough for the hardworking families that really need tax relief.This is a budget that turns its back on education. This is probably the most remarkable trade-off in this budget. The President sent a budget that asked for $21 billion over 10 years above inflation for education programs. The budget that the Democrats here on the House had asked for was $150 billion over 10 years above inflation for education. In the Senate, in a bipartisan way, they added $300 billion above inflation for education, for after-school and pre-school; give us more teachers, repair the school buildings, all the things that Americans are asking for across the country to improve public education. Yet, this budget takes out every cent of the increases that the President asked for or we asked for or the Senate asked for. We are at a flatline budget for education if this budget is voted for.How in the world do we explain to anyone what we have done on education? We are right back to where we started, after a long trip of public relations saying to people we want to help education, and now we are not doing that.Then I think if this budget is passed, there will not be a Medicare prescription drug program. In fact, I do not think there will be a prescription drug program of any reasonable kind that will affect the people in this country. When I go home now on weekends, people come up to me and say, ``Hey, where is the prescription drug program?'' Everybody had ads in the campaign, Republicans and Democrats alike. We all said we wanted a prescription drug program. I defy anyone to find that program in this budget.Why do I say that? I say that because I think the budget tries to get to $300 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug program. The problem with that is it spends the Medicare surplus. It is really taking the money out of the Medicare surplus to give it to prescription drugs. I do not think we are going to do that. I do not think we are going to have a prescription drug program if this budget is our budget.I did not even get to low-income energy assistance, COPS on the beat, conservation and renewable programs for energy. If one goes out in America today, all anybody can talk about is $3 gasoline and not having enough electricity. If one goes out on the West Coast, they are having brownouts and blackouts.People are focused on energy and there is nothing in this budget to deal with the energy issue, which is on the lips of every American today. Let me sum up by saying just one thing. This budget is a farce and it is a fraud. At the end, America deserves better than that. We can do better than that. I would pray we could send this budget back to the committee. Let us have a real bipartisan process where ideas from both sides are incorporated into a final product. Let us give America a budget that is worthy of this great country.,2015-03-16 18:10:27.076852,2015-03-16 18:10:27.076852,House,ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE,2001-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-09/html/CREC-2001-05-09-pt1-PgH2031.htm,63,44,147,H2031-H2049,G000132,mr. gephardt
465,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, it is with much pride that I rise today to congratulate one of Missouri's educators. With emphasis placed on the need to reform our public schools and ensure that our children receive quality instruction, it pleases me to know that Graden Elementary School is on the right path. I ask that you join me in congratulating Principal Michael J. Otto, recently named a recipient of the 2001 National Distinguished Principals award.The U.S. Department of Education, along with the National Association of Elementary School Principals, began this program in 1984 to honor those principals that exemplify the vital leadership necessary to guide our school communities. Education Secretary Paige commented that, ``Principals today--more than ever before--are critical leaders in the effort to improve America's public schools. I applaud these outstanding principals for their dedication, achievements, tirelessness, and leadership. I look forward io working with principals across the nation . . . to improve the performance of all students so that no child is left behind.'' I could not agree more with Secretary Paige's comments. I find it admirable that the recipients were nominated by their peers, further demonstrating the effects of their commitment to educational excellence.I am honored to represent a man who has given so much of himself to provide our schoolchildren not only with excellent instruction, but also inspiration. Again, I congratulate Principal Michael J. Otto and commend him for his diligent work on behalf of our schoolchildren.,2015-03-16 18:10:27.243948,2015-03-16 18:10:27.243948,Extensions,CONGRATULATING PRINCIPAL MICHAEL J.

466,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Safe and Successful Schools Act of 2000. It will help modernize our public schools by providing grants and loans for up to 8,300 renovation projects in high-need school districts. It will continue the highly successful class size reduction program by helping communities hire an additional 20,000 highly qualified teachers. It will boost investments in quality after-school and summer school programs advocated by the President. It will help us close the digital divide that currently leaves too many poor children and their teachers behind. It will bolster safe and drug free school programs, and strengthen programs to reduce hate crimes by children.ESEA is our nation's flagship education partnership with local communities. It provides vital assistance to the most vulnerable, educationally challenged children in America. Until this Congress, the ESEA had enjoyed a rich and enduring history of bipartisanship.Unfortunately, Senate and House Republicans have been highly partisan and divisive. At the beginning of the ESEA process, we urged Republicans to work in a bipartisan way. Instead, they proceeded in a highly partisan manner and created havoc throughout the reauthorization process. In the House, they carved up the ESEA into seven disjointed pieces--hoping to bolster their devastating public image and terrible performance on education.Today, the ESEA process is in shambles. Straight A's, the Republican education block grant bill, has a veto threat pending and has no chance of becoming law. Their Teacher Empowerment bill has a veto threat pending because of its gratuitous attack and block granting of the Clinton Class Size Reduction Act. Conservative Republican Members are blocking floor action on two other ESEA bills, Even Start and Impact Aid. And the one major bipartisan bill, H.R. 2, has been sharply and publicly attacked by reactionary Republican Members of the Education and Workforce Committee.Republicans repeatedly refused to work with Democrats to craft the pending ESEA bill, H.R. 4141, and voted in mass to defeat 52 of 54 amendments offered by Democratic Members. The bill passed out of committee is a legislative disaster. Every major education group opposes the bill. The President will probably veto it.Because the Republicans have decided to play politics with America's school children, they have placed in jeopardy passage of this comprehensive Federal aid program to education. If the Republicans leave town this year without enacting the ESEA, it would be the first time that the program has permanently lapsed in its 35-year history.I urge the Republican leadership to stop playing politics with our nation's school children, and pass ESEA legislation that can bring urgent relief and assistance to our public schools this year. Helping Communities Repair and Modernize Unsafe SchoolhousesCommunities across the country are struggling to address critical needs to build new schools and renovate existing one. One-third of all public schools--about 25,000 schools-- need extensive repair or replacement. A recent survey documented over $250 billion dollars of unmet school modernization funding need. The Safe and Successful Schools Act of 2000 authorizes $1.3 billion annually to help communities make emergency school renovations such as repairing roofs, fixing dangerous electrical wiring and plumbing, bringing schools into compliance with fire safety codes, undertaking asbestos removal or abatement, and removing lead-based paint. The Act will support up to 8,300 renovation projects in high-poverty, high-need school districts that have little or no capacity to fund urgent repairs over the next five years.Expanding Access to Education Technology/Closing the Digital DivideTechnology in the schools can substantially improve student learning, classroom management, the professional development of teachers, and assessment of student progress. Most importantly, strong school technology programs report significant impact on gains in student achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics. Technology has its greatest impact with low-income and rural students as well as with expanding opportunities for girls. Unfortunately, the ``digital divide'' still separates the technology haves and the technology have-nots--leaving our most disadvantaged children without vital knowledge and tools to compete with their more advantaged peers. The Safe and Successful Schools Act of 2000 increases the Federal commitment to technology and closing the digital divide. The Act provides $500 million for the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund program, to help the most disadvantaged school districts to provide educators with sustained, high quality training to integrate technology in their classrooms and provide students with the latest access to advantaged technology resources. The Act creates a $50 million Go Girls program to help encourage the ongoing interest in girls in science, mathematics and technology, and prepare girls to pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees and careers in science, mathematics, or technology. The bill will provide new support for restructuring teacher education programs so that new teachers are proficient in the use of educational technologies and can integrate technology throughout their instructional practices. Lastly, it also creates new initiatives to develop and expand cutting edge technologies to improve teaching and learning, and to establish community technology centers in the neediest communities.,2015-03-16 18:10:27.376042,2015-03-16 18:10:27.376042,Extensions,THE SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS ACT OF 2000,2000-05-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-02/html/CREC-2000-05-02-pt1-PgE613.htm,52,0,146,E613-E614,C000488,mr. clay

I think it is a shame that in his last year here in Congress we could not have made it easier for him, but I think he has worked real hard to fund important programs to improve the education, health, and well-being of all Americans.I commend him very much for the hard work that he has done to double NIH over the 5 years, increase funding for graduate medical education for children's hospitals, and in strengthening our Nation's community health centers.From one who represents a very poor area, a very rural area, the fact that he has been able to increase our community health centers by $81.3 million is a huge boost to those people who are underserved in my area, who do not have access to affordable health care, and every dollar that we spend on community health centers will help the insured have much more health care than they presently have.I also want to just mention quickly the $200 million increase for impact aid funding. These help reimburse our localities for revenues lost. I can tell the Members, with so much public land in my district, this is going to be a very big boost.I would ask my colleagues to support this bill.,2015-03-16 18:10:27.514136,2015-03-16 18:10:27.514136,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-06-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-08/html/CREC-2000-06-08-pt1-PgH4055-2.htm,70,36,146,H4055-H4077,E000172,mrs. emerson

One amendment calls for a $5 billion investment to help local communities repair crumbling and overcrowded schools. The other would provide critical assistance to communities that are committed to locally driven public school renewal. Unfortunately, the majority of the Committee on Rules blocked consideration of these education measures by refusing to waive points of order against the amendments.To me it is incomprehensible that we continue to ignore the needs of millions of schoolchildren desperately in need of our help. It is also incomprehensible to me that with all of the problems that we are facing and our school systems are facing that this silly piece of legislation would be the first one to come out of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities in this session of Congress. It has nothing to do, it has no relevancy whatsoever with resolving or addressing the problems that our children are facing in the school system, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we may address the Nation's real educational priorities.,2015-03-16 18:10:27.657243,2015-03-16 18:10:27.657243,House,PROHIBITION ON FEDERALLY SPONSORED NATIONAL TESTING,1998-02-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-05/html/CREC-1998-02-05-pt1-PgH339-2.htm,7,8,144,H339-H355,C000488,mr. clay

470,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the conference report, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the Rangel motion to recommit. I believe with all my heart that this issue, education and child rearing, is the most important issue that faces us as a people. We have never needed more in our history to have well-educated, mentally capable young people.In my home State of Missouri, the only issue that really dominated the State legislature was how we could go from 30,000 to 60,000 prison cells over the next 5 years, a symbol of failure of our child rearing and our education system in this country.I am tough on law and order and so are my constituents. But I say to my constituents, you cannot afford what we are doing. We cannot afford to hold a million and a half people in prison, to carry them, to keep them because they are unsafe to have in our society. We also know that if we raise children correctly, they will not get into trouble. They will not be dysfunctional citizens. But we also know our society has changed dramatically. People are not at home to raise children as they once were. That is a fact of life. We are not going to change that. And so we have to put the investment into education so that children are raised correctly.What this bill misses entirely is that there is a whole revolution going on out in public schools to fix the schools to meet the need. In my district, I have a school in the inner city that is getting great results. The kids get great grades. I went there and I asked them how they are doing it. They said, we have parents as first teachers in the public school to teach parents how to be better parents and how to raise children. They have preschool in the public school. They have after-school in the public school, so children are engaged even at age zero, age 6 months, age 1 year, age 3 years in constructive, professionally run activities so they can be productive citizens when they come out of the education process.Does this bill support that effort that is going on in Shepherd School in my district? I daresay not. What this bill offers is $7 a year to the families that are sending those kids to Shepherd School. No, what Shepherd School needs is not this bill. This is a silly bill. It is a frivolous bill. It is not serious about public education. Seven dollars a year to families in my district fighting to get their kids a good education is frivolous.The Rangel substitute would offer real help to the people at Shepherd School. What do they need? They need bigger classrooms. They need a competent building. They need computers in the classrooms. They need help, real help. Listen to Paul Vallas, CEO of the Chicago Public Schools. This is somebody that is on the line every day. Mayor Daley in Chicago said, ``Give me the schools, give me the responsibility, and we will fix them,'' and he is fixing them. He put his best person on this job. Here is what Paul Vallas says. He says this bill, the Coverdell bill, is really designed to give more affluent people compensation for decisions they already made to go private. That is all it is. This does not help public education. It does not help the people that are out there in the crucible of the fight to fix public education. It helps just a few people who have already chosen to send their kids to private schools. What a shame this is. What a missed opportunity this is.I urge Members to vote for the Rangel substitute, which gives real, tangible help to the real revolution that is going on out there in the real world to fix the public schools so all of our kids are productive citizens, and vote against a frivolous, unserious, ridiculous piece of legislation that does nothing but help the privileged few.,2015-03-16 18:10:28.020497,2015-03-16 18:10:28.020497,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2646, EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1998,1998-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-18/html/CREC-1998-06-18-pt1-PgH4727-5.htm,80,45,144,H4727-H4739,G000132,mr. gephardt

He is the national spokesperson for the Foundation for Exceptional Children's ``Yes I Can'' program which encourages disabled children to reach their goals.But while Neil is working to improve education, the House leadership is making drastic cuts in education programs. In Missouri, title I programs, which help children with learning disabilities, will lose over $19 million--critical funds for students who need extra help in reading, writing and math.I want to say to the House leadership--it's fourth down, 1 yard to go, and there are 30 seconds on the clock--let's go for it and reinstate the much needed funds for our children.Thank you, Neil Smith, for sharing your talents and success to help all children achieve their dreams as you have.,2015-03-16 18:10:28.687998,2015-03-16 18:10:28.687998,House,SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO NEIL SMITH,1996-03-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-14/html/CREC-1996-03-14-pt1-PgH2228-4.htm,35,1,142,H2228-H2229,M000316,ms. mccarthy
476,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3055 and commend my colleague, Mr. Norwood, for cosponsoring this legislation. I am proud to note that this bill was favorably reported by the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities with unanimous, bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, this bill corrects a problem with respect to section 326 of title III of the Higher Education Act. That section was added to the act in 1986 as a way to provide support for historically black graduate and professional institutions of higher education which perform vitally important services for our Nation.As Mr. Norwood stated, the five schools initially included in section 326 educate more than half of all black doctors, dentists, and pharmacists, as well as 75 percent of all black veterinarians each year. That is a major return on the small investment provided by the Federal Government.H.R. 3055 allows those five institutions to continue to do what they do so well. It will allow them to remain eligible to receive section 326 support at no additional cost to the Federal Government.I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.

477,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Thank you, Mr. President.As I mentioned earlier, education is the key to breaking the intergenerational cycle of welfare dependency. This amendment would allow States to require that parents on welfare be responsible for ensuring that their minor children are in school.It would be this simple. If you are on welfare, your children should be in school. If we care about breaking the vicious intergenerational cycle of welfare we should care about making sure that individuals who are on welfare accept the responsibility of sending their children to school. We must look to the long-term in reforming welfare. We must look at what we can do to save the future of our children. Every child in America can attend school. Every child can earn a high school diploma. It costs nothing but commitment. Too often education is ignored and trashed because it is devalued by our welfare culture. Teen dropout rates soar. They skip classes. We should not pay parents to encourage lifestyles of dependency on and off welfare and in and out of minimum-wage jobs. States should be able to give children on welfare a fighting chance.Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.,2015-03-16 18:10:28.932149,2015-03-16 18:10:28.932149,Senate,RECESS,1996-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-07-23/html/CREC-1996-07-23-pt1-PgS8501.htm,109,63,142,S8501-S8532,A000356,mr. ashcroft

479,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of International Women's Day. For more than 100 years, this important day has recognized the critical roles and contributions women play worldwide. International Women's Day reminds us of how far we've come and of how far we still need to go in order to achieve gender equality worldwide.Women continue to face serious challenges across our globe, particularly with access to health care, education, and economic opportunity. Women also are overwhelmingly the targets of human trafficking and gender-based violence. Today, women and girls are disproportionately burdened by extreme poverty, making up 70% of the world's one billion people who live off less than $1 per day.Here at home, we celebrate March as Women's History Month. The focus this year is ``Women's Education--Women's Empowerment'' which clearly reflects the goals of furthering gender equality worldwide. And it is no coincidence that one leads to the other. When women and girls have access to educational opportunities, their subsequent empowerment allows families and entire communities to flourish. And evidence shows that when these untapped agents of change are empowered to engage in the political process, governments are more effective and responsive to the needs of their people.For real progress in women's rights, we must take a comprehensive approach to combat all barriers to women's equality--physical, psychological, educational, economic, and cultural. Let's use this International Women's Day as an opportunity to reignite our commitment to gender equality here at home and around the globe.,2015-03-16 18:10:29.187353,2015-03-16 18:10:29.187353,Extensions,MARKING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY,2012-03-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-03-09/html/CREC-2012-03-09-pt1-PgE359-3.htm,39,0,158,E359,C001060,mr. carnahan

Senator Earl Blackwell of Hillsboro sponsored Senate Bill Number Seven, which made possible the formation and financing of public junior colleges in Missouri. Jefferson became the second junior college district in Missouri to be approved.Seventeen months later the first courses are offered at Hillsboro High School with 14 faculty members and 303 students. Jefferson College moved into its first permanent building on the Hillsboro campus in September of 1965, and held its first commencement in June of 1966, where 31 graduates received associate degrees.In 1967, Jefferson College became the first community college in Missouri to be designated as an area vocational school. Today, in addition to the Hillsboro campus, the college has expanded to sites in Arnold, Cedar Hill and Imperial, which offers programs in Certified Nurse Assistant, EMT-Paramedic and a Law Enforcement Academy, as well as a fifth campus which offers online instruction.As a testament to their vision to make higher education more accessible to their community, Jefferson College has successfully now grown to over 5,500 full and part-time college credit students and 4,300 plus students in continuing education classes.In closing, I ask all my colleagues to join me in wishing the community of Jefferson College congratulations on their fiftieth anniversary.,2015-03-16 18:10:29.445509,2015-03-16 18:10:29.445509,Extensions,RECOGNIZING JEFFERSON COLLEGE AS IT CELEBRATES ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY,2013-04-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-04-09/html/CREC-2013-04-09-pt1-PgE399.htm,46,0,159,E399,L000569,mr. luetkemeyer

485,MO,Blaine,Luetkemeyer,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Allan W. Purdy, the founding president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA). On October 13, 2010, this strong advocate for higher education passed away at 96. He dedicated his life to removing financial barriers to education and helping students access awards, scholarships, and financial aid.Purdy's life experiences strongly influenced his passion for financial aid and serving students. He graduated from high school in the middle of the Great Depression and worked his way through college with the help of the National Youth Administration, a newly created national work program for students. He earned a mere $15 a month, which paid for his graduate degree from the College of Agriculture at the University of Missouri.After graduation, Purdy served his country in the U.S. Navy as a PT boat captain during World War II. After the war, he returned to the University of Missouri to work as an extension horticulturist. In this position, he toured the state helping farmers resolve problems with their crops. Here, he saw firsthand the number of qualified students who lacked the financial resources to attend college and vowed to advocate on their behalf for more grants and work aid. The University of Missouri's president promoted him to assistant to the dean of the College of Agriculture, which led to his role in creating a department in the president's office to coordinate scholarships, jobs, and loans for all the students on campus.Under the direction of the University of Missouri's president, Purdy began meeting with other aid administrators in the Midwest and helped form the Midwest Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators in 1962. During this time, Congress was working on student aid issues and looked to the six regional, financial associations for suggestions. In hope of creating a more unified voice, Purdy strongly advocated for a national structure. In 1966, the regional representatives created the National Student Financial Aid Council, and Allan Purdy served as its chair for three years. It became NASFAA in 1969 and has always stressed the importance and needs of students.A large part of the organization's success is attributed to Purdy's tireless efforts and ability to build strong relationships with key policymakers and higher education advocates. He developed a reputation for being an excellent witness at congressional hearings and established NASFAA as a trusted resource for financial aid information.In 1975, Purdy received the first Lifetime Membership Award, the highest award that NASFAA can bestow. He retired in 1979 and was appointed to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority's (MOHELA's) Board of Directors in 1981.We have lost an irreplaceable advocate for college access and success. I believe educating our youth is one of the most important aspects in equipping our children with the necessary tools to succeed.

After receiving his undergraduate degree from Franklin College in Indiana and his Master of Science and Doctor of Education degrees from Indiana University, Dr. Cummings has committed almost half a century to education. From coaching basketball to becoming the district superintendent in 1995, Dr. Cummings has continually worked to improve the lives of his students. During his 49 years as an educator, Dr. Cummings also always strived to serve his community. He was president of the Greater Kansas City School Administrators Association, served on the board of the directors for the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and served on the Education Commissioner's Advisory Committee.During his time as superintendent of the North Kansas City School District, Dr. Cummings changed the way the school district approached both education and the surrounding community. Dr. Cummings built a core foundation of transparency, community partnerships, technology, and impressive physical facilities. Due to these efforts, the school district began to receive money again from the community to pay for bonds. This was revolutionary for the school district, as every single request for school bonds in the 17 years prior to Dr. Cummings was turned down. Dr. Cummings commissioned a panel of community, government and business leaders that shaped the district's new mission--to provide an elite educational experience that produced enlightened citizens adaptable to change and involved in their communities.Dr. Cummings will leave many legacies at North Kansas City Schools. He created a professional and leadership development program, new career and technical education options for students, organizational efficiency, an award-winning money management team, standardized curriculum and differentiated instruction.Dr. Cummings has also been awarded numerous times throughout his tenure as superintendent. He was honored by YouthFriends as their first recipient of the School-Based Mentoring Achievement and Advancement Award. In 2005, Dr. Cummings was named the Missouri Superintendent of the Year. The following year, he received the Look North award for being an Outstanding Northland Leader by the Clay County Economic Development Council. In 2008, he was recognized as an Outstanding Missourian by the Missouri House of Representatives, and most recently, the school district's administration building was renamed the Thomas P. Cummings Administrative Center.Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Tom Cummings for his many years of dedicated service to the North Kansas City School District. His commitment to the students, the school and our community provide a strong example of the kind of leader we should all strive to be.

487,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Sumner High School, the first school west of the Mississippi river to offer secondary education to African Americans. This year marks the 130th anniversary of the school's founding as ``The High School for Colored Children.'' Originally housed in the former Washington School at 11th and Spruce streets in downtown St. Louis, the school was renamed on October 12, 1875, in honor of Charles Sumner, a Massachusetts Senator who was an ardent supporter of African-American rights. In 1861 Senator Sumner was the first U.S. Senator to call for full emancipation. The decision to name the school in his honor reflected the school's role as a preeminent institution for African Americans. Dropping ``colored school'' in favor of Sumner High occurred fifteen years before local African-American leaders succeeded in persuading the St. Louis Board of Schools to designate names for all segregated schools.In the aftermath of the Civil War, Missouri passed a new state constitution requiring all school boards to support education for African Americans. However, the Board of Education for Colored Schools occupied only rented space and its schools moved often. Sumner was no exception. In 1895 it was relocated to 15th and Walnut streets, near the saloons and pool halls of downtown St. Louis. Concerned citizens petitioned school officials to move the school again and in 1910 Sumner was relocated to The Ville neighborhood, where it occupied a new structure at 4248 Cottage Avenue. The new Sumner High strengthened the neighborhood's status as a center for middle-class African-American life in St. Louis.Another historical landmark tied to Sumner High School involved the hiring of African-American teachers. Initially, Sumner had an all white faculty, but the parents requested that a special effort be made to recruit African-American teachers. Two years later, in 1877, the school's first African-American principal took charge.Sumner High School further enhanced educational opportunities for African Americans in Missouri when, in 1890, it established an extension called the Sumner Normal School to train elementary school teachers. In 1925 the Sumner Normal School became a college; it was known as the Sumner Teachers College until 1930 when it was renamed Harriet Beecher Stowe Teachers College. In 1940 the Teachers College moved to new facility on Pendleton Street where it remained until 1954 when, in one of St. Louis' first efforts to desegregate its public schools, the St. Louis Board of Education merged Stowe College with the all-white Harris Teachers College.Sumner graduated its first class in 1885 and over the years its alumni list boasts a number of accomplished African Americans, including the opera singer Grace Bumbry, activist Dick Gregory, musician Tina Turner, tennis great Arthur Ashe, Liberian Ambassador Lester Walton, educator Julia Davis, rock history legend Chuck Berry, performer Robert McFerrin, actor Robert Guillaume, Yankee catcher-outfielder (and the American League's first black Most Valuable Player) Elston Howard and local newscaster Julius Hunter, to name just a few.Mr. Speaker, it is with deep pride that I recognize Sumner High School, a symbol of progress in African American history for its distinguished record of achievement in public education. As a community leader and elected official, I am proud to salute Sumner and all Sumner students and alumni on this very special anniversary. Sumner High School is a source of pride for St. Louisans and a model for public schools across the nation.,2015-03-16 18:10:30.187035,2015-03-16 18:10:30.187035,Extensions,HONORING THE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF SUMNER HIGH SCHOOL,2005-05-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-05-26/html/CREC-2005-05-26-pt1-PgE1116-4.htm,72,0,151,E1116-E1117,C001049,mr. clay
488,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 393--the House Budget Committee's Federal budget. This bill is nothing but fiscal illusion--it is unfair to the average American family and it is irresponsible public policy.This budget proposal is designed to create record Federal deficits while decimating valuable domestic programs. Public education, transportation, veterans benefits, environmental protection and small business programs would all be drastically cut in order to increase defense spending and maintain tax breaks for a select wealthy few.Unbelievably, this bill would gut the Social Security surplus in order to ensure that tax cuts for the wealthy are not jeopardized. Social Security is one of the most successful social programs any nation has ever established. It has provided a real and valuable safety net to millions of seniors and yet this budget would diminish it in order to advance a narrow agenda, an agenda that excludes our Nation's seniors, excludes our Nation's children, excludes our Nation's veterans, and offers very little to any citizen who is not part of a small powerful elite.The House Budget Committee bill offers little for education over the next 5 years, providing $9.4 billion less than is authorized by No Child Left Behind, it also freezes funding for Pell grants, cuts funding for Perkins loans, and cuts vocational education by 25 percent.And this budget guts $358 million for health programs in 2005, which is even less than the President requested. And given what we know about the true cost of last year's Medicare Prescription Drug sham bill, it is hard to believe that this budget proposal offers nothing to help seniors with their prescription drug costs while providing $46 billion in special payments to HMOs.Mr. Chairman, under the former administration the budget was balanced for the first time in a generation. Now the current administration has squandered that legacy, our $5.6 trillion surplus is gone and now this budget bill will help achieve a $3 trillion deficit.Mr. Chairman, I support the Congressional Black Caucus Alternative Budget. This legislative proposal would invest in America's future without undermining fiscal stability. This budget plan will improve domestic programs that serve American families; it will increase funding for homeland security, environmental protection, rail transportation, health care and health research. It will also increase funding for veterans benefits and for educational programs including Head Start, No Child Left Behind, Safe and Drug Free schools, Perkins loans, Pell grants and job training, vocational education and adult education.The Congressional Black Caucus raises revenues by rescinding tax cuts for those earning over $200,000 in gross income, it also plugs tax loopholes and eliminates tax avoidance schemes that feed the coffers of the rich and prevent us from paying down the Federal deficit.Mr. Chairman, I support the CBC alternative budget as it is a fiscally sound budget that makes a real investment in our Nation's future.,2015-03-16 18:10:30.317127,2015-03-16 18:10:30.317127,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005,2004-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-25/html/CREC-2004-03-25-pt1-PgH1495-2.htm,39,238,150,H1495-H1565,C001049,mr. clay

Under Bob's leadership all segments of the greater Kansas City community have become interconnected and established partnerships working together to make a difference and improve Kansas City's quality of life, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. During a decade of creating change for a healthier community, Bridging the Gap succeeded in educating the public through environmental publications and speakers bureaus, hosting special green events for environmental awareness and advocacy, and ballot initiatives that brought curbside recycling to Kansas City.I have been an ardent supporter of Earth Day since the first one in 1970, when I showed my support by bicycling to my job as a schoolteacher and discussing with my students the responsibility each individual has to our global environment. Since 1997 my Earth Day celebration has come to include Bridging the Gap's Earth Day Walk, an eagerly anticipated annual celebration and fundraiser for more than 1,000 Kansas Citians. More than 5,000 area residents attend the Party for the Planet at the Kansas City Zoo, another Earth Day event sponsored by Bridging the Gap.Bridging the Gap Inc. has grown dynamically and now includes: RecycleFirst, Kansas City's curbside recycling education program; Keep Kansas City beautiful, a beautification project involving more than 7,700 volunteers for 165 metro wide cleanups; Kansas City Wildlands, a natural and wild places restoration and conservation project; Environmental Excellence Business Network, an education and mentoring program for businesses; Waste Reduction and Recycling Consultation, an advisory, assessment and action program for governments, businesses, educational and cultural institutions; Regional By-Product Synergy Initiative, a project to help business and government reduce waste and increase productivity; Shadowcliff Retreat Center, environmental education and retreat center in Grand Lake, Colorado; and Environmental Excellence Awards, an annual event to honor individuals, businesses and schools.Bob's efforts have been recognized locally and nationally for Building the Gap's leadership. Awards include: National Recycling Coalition's Award for Environmental and Community Leadership, Kansas City Consensus Achiever Award, Missouri Governor Carnahan's Pollution Prevention Award, EPA Pollution Prevention Award, American Forest &amp; Paper Association's Best Paper Recycling Award, Mid-America Regional Council Regional Leadership Award, Waste Reduction and Recycling Award for non-profits, Missouri Environmental Education Association Environmental Education Service Award, and Keep America Beautiful First Place National Litter Prevention Award.Bob's leadership and vision of collaboration, his perseverance in environmental problem solving, and his service and commitment to a healthy earth have inspired thousands of individuals to make a difference. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Robert J. Mann, a bridge builder who has indeed made our community, our region and our planet a better place through his tireless efforts to honor our Earth and all who share its wonders.,2015-03-16 18:10:30.461234,2015-03-16 18:10:30.461234,Extensions,HONORING ROBERT J.

490,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I believe the rule to H.R. 2210 will dismantle Head Start which, in these desperate economic times, should be strengthened, not weakened.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule on the School Readiness Act, which would seriously jeopardize the Head Start early education program.For decades, Head Start has been a successful program dedicated to helping disadvantaged children receive the preparation they need to succeed in school and to lead better lives. This bill would leave our neediest children behind by shortchanging the Head Start program and putting its federal funding at risk in States that are mired in their own budget woes.In my district of Kansas City, MO, over 3,800 children are enrolled in Head Start programs and they depend on help from the Federal Government. Head Start is one of the oldest and most thoroughly studied early education programs in America. Studies find that children involved in Head Start programs are less likely to repeat a grade and to require special education services than disadvantaged children who are not lucky enough to experience Head Start. Furthermore, Head Start students are more likely to graduate high school and to attend college.This past Fall a young mother named Michelle enrolled her son, August, in a Head Start program in Kansas City. Her two older daughters had already successfully completed the program, but Michelle worried that her son's speech and physical disabilities would put him far behind his classmates when he started kindergarten. The Head Start Mental Health and Disability Consultant coordinated his efforts with the County Health Department and the North Kansas City School District to insure that Michelle's fears would not become a reality. An Individualized Education plan was put into place and August was enrolled in speech therapy classes. Today, all of Michelle's children are doing well academically and socially, and she stays involved in Head Start as a volunteer so that she can give back to the program that meant so much to her and her children.The measure before us (H.R. 2210) authorizes barely enough funds to even cover the cost of inflation, let alone expand Head Start programs. It will actually reduce the number of children in the program. It provides no resources for teacher training and will allow discrimination in hiring practices. But the part of this legislation that concerns me the most is that it puts Head Start money into the hands of States that will be able to use these block grant funds to defray their own deficits rather than expanding the program to reach students.Governor Holden of Missouri shares my concern that resources usually suffer when a federal program becomes a block grant. It is his fear, and mine, that federal mandates will be shifted to deficit wracked states such as mine, forcing them to do more with less money.Head Start works in Missouri, and it works all over the country. Let's put federal dollars into education programs such as Head Start that have been proven to make students ready for a successful school experience and a productive life. It's the best investment we can make for our Nation's future.Thank you, Mr. Speaker.,2015-03-16 18:10:30.609334,2015-03-16 18:10:30.609334,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2210, SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2003,2003-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-07-24/html/CREC-2003-07-24-pt2-PgH7518-3.htm,111,70,149,H7518-H7531,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
491,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, the House is meeting today--69 days after the beginning of the fiscal year--to debate H.R. 2673, a colossal $328 billion spending bill that includes 7 of the 13 annual appropriations measures for fiscal year 2004.The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Young, and the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Obey, have worked diligently this year to pass the annual spending bills one-by-one. However, as it became apparent that the Congress could not approve these measures individually, congressional leaders began working to fit them together into one catch-all bill, like the pieces of a $328 billion puzzle. Unfortunately, the pieces of this puzzle are not fitting together in a way that benefits the American people.I will oppose H.R. 2673 because it breaks promises Congress made regarding education, it cuts necessary Federal funds for State and local law enforcement, and fails to extend unemployment benefits for thousands of Missouri workers who are currently out of work this holiday season.Education remains a top priority of the people of Missouri. When I am back home, I frequently visit schools to meet with students and teachers. At nearly every location, teachers and administrators inform me of the difficulties they have when it comes to unfunded Federal mandates burdening their districts. School districts throughout the Show-Me State and the Nation are experiencing tough times as the poor economic conditions and the fiscal choices made by this Congress are leading to decreased revenue for schools. The professionals who teach our children and grandchildren deserve to have the resources they need to get the job done. When the Congress approves legislation authorizing specific legislative initiatives, we ought to fully fund them.H.R. 2673 provides $7.8 billion less than Congress promised in the No Child Left Behind Act and falls 45 percent short in special education funding promised under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reauthorization bill that passed earlier this year. It also freezes Pell Grant awards at a time when State universities are drastically increasing tuition costs and underfunds by 18 percent the funds necessary for Impact Aid. H.R. 2673 also establishes a private school voucher program for students who live in the District of Columbia, moving Congress a step closer to abandoning our historical commitment to public schools and establishing the first Federal subsidies for getting a private school education.As a former prosecuting attorney and juvenile officer, I have worked closely with law enforcement officials. Law enforcement personnel play a critical role in protecting Missouri communities from the scourge of methamphetamine abuse and other crimes and from the threats posed by terrorism. Congress has a duty to provide adequate funding for those who protect us in our hometowns. Under H.R. 2673, State and local law enforcement is funded at $500 million below last year's levels.As the holidays approach, millions of Americans are still facing unemployment. While economic news has indicated that the numbers of jobless Americans decreasing, Congress must work to extend unemployment benefits to those who are not so fortunate. Time and again, we have worked in a bipartisan manner to assist unemployed Americans. I am disappointed that the House leadership has failed in this regard, especially at this time of year.Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2673 shortchanges teachers and students, law enforcement personnel, and unemployed Missourians. Appropriations bills should speak to our priorities as a nation. I cannot support this measure that sets our country on a course of misplaced priorities.,2015-03-16 18:10:30.755444,2015-03-16 18:10:30.755444,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2673, CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004,2003-12-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-12-08/html/CREC-2003-12-08-pt1-PgH12766-2.htm,175,67,149,H12766-H12845,S000465,mr. skelton
492,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,I appreciate the gentleman yielding.What is interesting about our Tax Code is it really does punish those who wish to save and invest. There are so many other nations that have a higher savings rate than the United States of America because we have built into our code, in fact, I am so familiar again with my 1040, having just spent so much time with it, line 8 of your 1040 says what was your interest income, put that here, because we are going to tax it. A lot of nations do not do that.So we have tried in various ways to help American families, especially as they look way down the road at retirement. We have a vexing problem ahead of us as far as the baby boomers retiring and the future solvency of Social Security. That is an issue for another day.But what we have done over the course of Congress, since 1997, as the gentleman recalls the significant tax relief that we passed back in 1997, that was actually signed into law by then President Clinton, we created some additional savings vehicles and tried to expand the opportunities for families to put money aside in 401(k) plans, or, as the gentleman knows, really a pet issue of mine, to help parents save for their childrens' education. Back in 1997, the idea was created of an education savings accounts. Now we have the ability, because of last summer's tax cut, the Bush tax cut, as the gentleman has referred to it, we have now given more flexibility to families to put money, or even neighbors or churches or businesses, to put money into a family's education account in the name of their child.It used to be pretty strict as to what that education account could be used for. Now we have some flexibility. Not only can you contribute more money into it, up to $2,000 a year, but it is not just for those students, those children who go to public college. It could be used for any educational expense for any child. It could be K through 12. It could be a tutor at school if you are having trouble with 4th grade math. It could be a computer program, it could be a foreign language skill or some help in that regard. It can be anything to help educate our kids.So this was a tremendous change, a positive change. We called it the Coverdell account in honor of the late Senator from Georgia who had first created this idea back in 1997 of putting aside money and letting the interest that is built up be tax free.I hesitate to think, I shudder to think, that if we do not make this tax cut permanent, that that flexibility is gone, the ability to contribute money into that education account, up to $2,000 a year, is gone.So the number of positive tax changes that we have helped create, in a bipartisan way, friends across the aisle have helped vote for it, worked for some of these items, those items would be no longer in the Tax Code. That positive tax relief would be obliterated if this House and Congress do not act to make the tax cut permanent.,2015-03-16 18:10:30.897539,2015-03-16 18:10:30.897539,House,MAKING PERMANENT THE BUSH TAX CUT,2002-04-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-16/html/CREC-2002-04-16-pt1-PgH1312.htm,42,22,148,H1312-H1318,H000948,mr. hulshof
493,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, the Republican leadership has once again succeeded in bringing to the floor a labor, health and education appropriations bill designed to please only themselves and their right-wing friends. H.R. 4577 fails to make needed investments in public education and the domestic workforce, and, as the result, would undermine American competitiveness in the 21st century. This bill has already received what has now become its customary and well-deserved veto threat from the Clinton administration. It is clearly going nowhere, and should be soundly defeated.This bill was doomed from its inception, because the economic premise upon which it is based is flawed. Earlier this year, before the appropriations process began, the Republican leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich. They attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution. This decision to squander the surplus, rather than invest it, severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our nation's critical needs.Overall, the bill provides $2.9 billion less than the President requested for the Department of Education, and $1.7 billion less for the Department of Labor. As the result, education, job training, workplace safety, and other programs are either frozen or cut, significantly reducing the level of services that can be provided.For example, the bill would slash Title I funding, forcing school districts to cut back on assistance to disadvantaged students. The Clinton/Clay class size reduction initiative is gutted, leaving school districts without the resources to hire and train 20,000 more top-quality teachers. Adequate funding is denied for after-school and summer programs intended to improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime. And no funds are provided to renovate crumbling and unsafe schools.At the same time efforts are ongoing in the Congress to erase limits on the immigration of foreign workers to fill high-tech jobs, this bill would make steep cuts in the funding of training programs aimed at helping domestic workers fill them and other positions. Dislocated workers and at-risk youth are particularly hard hit by these cuts, even though they are the one most in need of skills training. By failing to adequately invest in our own workforce, the Republican leadership is jeopardizing American competitiveness and prosperity.This bill also jeopardizes worker health and safety by shortchanging OSHA and blocking issuance of the ergonomics rule intended to prevent about 300,000 workplace injuries a year. The Wilson amendment would add insult to injury by cutting $25 million more from OSHA.Mr. Chairman, this appropriations bill is a disaster. It fails to adequately invest in education, and in the development and security of the nation's workforce. I urge a no vote on H.R. 4577.,2015-03-16 18:10:31.077668,2015-03-16 18:10:31.077668,House,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001,2000-06-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-12/html/CREC-2000-06-12-pt1-PgH4194-5.htm,72,167,146,H4194-H4215,C000488,mr. clay
494,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Madam Speaker, I deeply appreciate the comments that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), the Majority Leader, just made. I take very seriously the idea that he says that Republican Members of the House are concerned about the children and concerned about education. I accept that completely.I believe Members, all Members of this House want to improve the education and the upbringing of all of our children. That is a very important beginning agreement. We have a disagreement, obviously, about the role of vouchers and whether or not to take some of the money that we are spending on public education to give to vouchers that can be used in private and other schools. But we ought to build on our agreement rather than suffering from this ongoing disagreement.All of us want the children of the District of Columbia and every other jurisdiction in the country to succeed, to learn, to have proper values, to be productive, healthy citizens. That must be our number one goal. We believe that vouchers do not advance us toward that goal. Our concern, which is sincere and heartfelt, is that the children that are left behind will do worse, worse as a result of this legislation. Seventy-six thousand youngsters will not have the benefit of the vouchers. The 7,000 who get them may do better; they may not do better. But the 76,000 that are left behind will be hurt.Madam Speaker, what we should be talking about today are the kinds of things that the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia has brought forward, creative ideas to improve public education. And I take seriously what the majority leader has said about accountability. We should be for accountability.I put in legislation I call ``Reward for Results.'' It says that Federal aid, at least part of Federal aid, ought to be conditioned upon a school achieving results. We should be able to find out if children can read, write and compute at certain ages. And we should, in my view, be willing to condition part of Federal aid on them being able to achieve those conclusions.What I would hope we could have here is a discussion between the parties on creative ideas to fix the public schools that do not work; to realize that most of the public schools do work and do a very good job, but the ones that do not, we cannot afford that result.So, I hope Members will vote against this idea of vouchers. I hope we will meet again and talk about creative ideas to fix the public schools, to make them accountable, to get the results that we need, to make sure that every child is a productive citizen.I am heartened by what the Majority Leader has said today. I think we can find an agreement. I do not think this is it. I urge Members to vote against this bill. I wish the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia had the ability to bring her motion to recommit today, and I hope that if we could defeat this bill we could come back with a bipartisan agreement on education that would move us in the right direction.,2015-03-16 18:10:31.208766,2015-03-16 18:10:31.208766,House,ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE,1998-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-30/html/CREC-1998-04-30-pt1-PgH2660.htm,51,38,144,H2660-H2671,G000132,mr. gephardt
495,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that the conference report which accompanies H.R. 2646, the Education Savings and School Excellency Act, does not contain the provisions banning Federal funding for the President's federalized, individualized testing proposal. This provision, which I authored, has been removed in conference because of the clearly communicated concern that the President would veto the legislation based on this issue.The Senate and House have repeatedly given the administration a failing grade on respecting the role of parents, on local control of what is taught and how it is taught. The President has insisted on trying to promote federalized control of education. Federal testing would lead to a Federal curriculum.This administration has a lamentable record of harming the interests of American schoolchildren.For example, on school choice, the President wants to incarcerate America's most disadvantaged youngsters in dangerous, dysfunctional schools, rather than give them a choice of schools.On block grants, he wants to keep plowing taxpayer money into the bureaucracy, instead of investing more in our classrooms.Now, on school testing, he wants to cut the rug out from under the role of parents and communities--the most important factors in how well children do in schools.The more Members of this body have learned about the President's national testing proposal, the less they have liked it. Over the past year, the number of Senators opposing national testing has grown to a majority.When we first visited this issue last fall during debate on the Labor, HHS and educational appropriations bill, only 13 Senators voted against allowing the President's national testing proposal.Only one month later, 36 other Senators joined with me to threaten to filibuster the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill unless there was a ban on FY 1998 federal funding for the President's national testing proposal.In April of this year, when I offered my testing ban as an amendment to the Coverdell A+ bill, the Senate passed the provision by a vote of 52-47.Over in the House, Congressman Bill Goodling, Chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has continued to provide leadership in the fight against national testing. His bill to prohibit funds for national testing passed by a vote of 242-174 in February of this year.So it is clear that both Chambers of this Congress agree that national testing should be rejected. And the President of the United States wants to promote national testing, and does so, I believe, in an effort that would begin to nationalize the school system. Local control of schools is fundamentally important and should be protected. It is reflected in the understanding of the House and the Senate.The Senate Majority Leader and the Speaker of the House have provided to Chairman Goodling and me a written commitment that they will ensure that the text of the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill for 1999, and any supplemental or any other such legislation, will not leave Congress without a testing provision that Chairman Goodling and I find to be satisfactory. That, of course, would be a provision allowing no funds to develop national tests. If the appropriations bill does not make it to the President's desk, they say, then every effort will be made to include this in a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation.I appreciate this assurance from our leadership in both the House and Senate, and my colleagues can be sure that I will do everything in my power to hold them to their commitment.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter from the Major Leader and the Speaker to Chairman Goodling and me containing these assurances be printed in the Record after my remarks.,2015-03-16 18:10:31.342856,2015-03-16 18:10:31.342856,Senate,EDUCATIONAL SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT,1998-06-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-24/html/CREC-1998-06-24-pt1-PgS6918-2.htm,84,86,144,S6918-S6935,A000356,mr. ashcroft
496,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct, so that we can rein in some of the excesses of the Republican budget, and stand up for working families for change.The fact is, when we talk about the budget, we're not talking about a bunch of numbers and spreadsheets. We're talking about real people's lives.We're talking about the elderly woman in my town of St. Louis, scraping by on Social Security, counting pennies at the end of the month--and already hard-pressed to survive the deep Republican cuts in Medicare.We're talking about the young couple that is trying desperately to save for their children's education, and for their own retirement.We're talking about the families that can no longer care for their parents and grandparents, but can't afford the $40,000-dollar-a-year price tag of a nursing home without any help.It's no secret that I strongly opposed this Republican budget, because it heaped all the budget cuts on those seniors and families--carving up Medicare and jacking up the premiums; cutting into education and college loans; paring back nursing home assistance to lavish more tax breaks on people who don't need them.But today, we have a chance to help the seniors, children, and families who should be the foundation of any budget proposal: To prevent some of the deep cuts in education, at a time when we need more education, not less of it; to protect seniors on Medicare from being overbilled by their health plans and providers, when many of them just don't have that extra money; To preserve the standards that say your whole family doesn't have to go bankrupt to put your parents in a nursing home; and to do more to protect the clean air and clean water and environmental decency that are central to America's health and safety.This bill would tell the Committee on the Budget negotiators that they have to back away from the House Republicans' radicalism on those crucial issues, and toward the greater reason and moderation of the U.S. Senate.The point of this bill is very simple: America's hard-working families matter more than any special-interest lobbyist.The House Republicans' dangerous budget policies and Medicare cuts--already vetoed twice by the President--don't deserve another revival.And together, we can start to make this a budget that actually works for working people.Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote for this motion--to protect seniors on Medicare, and preserve nursing home standards, and secure education and the environment. Even these changes won't make the Republicans' budget perfect, but it will send an important message.That today, this Congress votes for families, for a change.Support this motion to instruct.,2015-03-16 18:10:31.464949,2015-03-16 18:10:31.464949,House,APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 178, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 1997,1996-05-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-05-30/html/CREC-1996-05-30-pt1-PgH5725-3.htm,77,22,142,H5725-H5732,G000132,mr. gephardt
497,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, this amendment relates to the education funding included in this budget proposal. I have joined with other Republican Senators in calling for an increase in Federal spending for education and urging that those additional dollars go directly to the classroom. This is a proposed sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I am offering this measure with Senator Gorton. It is a measure which already is at the desk.Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this budget is very generous in terms of education, providing additional resources for the purpose of enhancing the capacity of our students to perform.This budget provides, for instance, for my own State--I think if the money were to be divided equally between the States, Missouri would get $56 million next year, more than it gets now. Over the next 5 years, it would get about $660 million more. So that is a substantial increase in the resource.I have joined with Senator Gorton of Washington to say that when we have that kind of resource flowing to the States, it is important for us that this increased resource in Federal education dollars be directed to the States and local schools out of the Federal budget and not to the Federal bureaucracy.You see, our intention with this resource is to elevate the capacity of students to perform, not to elevate the capacity or the propensity of the bureaucracy to intermeddle in directing, and sometimes misdirecting, the resources that would otherwise be best directed at the local level.Our hope is that this additional resource will give States and local communities, will give teachers and principals, and will give people at the classroom level--places where decisions can be made effectively about allocation of the resources--the maximum flexibility to design and run education programs that will literally elevate performance of our students.One of our Nation's highest priorities is that every child would have the opportunity to receive the kind of challenging, rigorous education that would prepare them for not only success personally, but would also prepare them as team members of Team U.S.A. to keep America where it ought to be--leading the world.Congress should develop and support Federal policy that will best promote education practices that succeed in our States and schools. Sometimes those practices are different in one State than they would be in other States. So we really want to invite the States, the school boards, the parents, and the teachers, those whose children are in the schools, to participate in developing the right deployment of these resources--spending the money wisely in ways that will help the students.Successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement, where parents really care, where parents get involved with the school system, where they energize their children, where they assign a high value to achievement in education. That is where our children soar. We should have Federal policy that gives the parents, the schools, the school boards, the school districts, the local governments, and the States the right to tailor the expenditure of resources so as to meet the needs of our children. Successful schools are also characterized by fundamental skills, excellent teachers, dollars spent in the classroom, and not dollars wasted in the bureaucracy. So many of our current Federal educational resources are misspent. They drive a demand for paperwork. They don't drive a demand for performance. They don't contain elements that further our goal of giving our children a world-class education. A number of our Federal education programs contain these mountainous paperwork burdens--regulations and restrictions that hinder States' and local schools' ability to design programs.Here are a couple of examples about the bureaucracy. Listen to these numbers. They are almost mind staggering.In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in State funds. So it takes 374 to administer the $8 billion in State funds. However, there are 297 State employees needed to oversee only $1 billion in Federal funds, six times as many employees, six times as much bureaucracy, six times as much administration per dollar of funds spent in Federal dollars as there are for State dollars.I think if we want to avoid that kind of overlay of inefficiency, if we want to avoid the weight of paper that is weighing down the educational system that keeps teachers writing reports to bureaucrats instead of teaching our students, we ought to be working for this amendment which says that resources should go to State and local efforts; they should be tailored to meet the needs of the schools and to elevate student performance. The enhanced resources in this bill should not be devoted to the Federal bureaucracy where we have that 6-to-1 ratio demonstrated in the Florida experience where there are six times as many administrators for federal dollars as there are for State dollars.The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours of paperwork each year just to receive the Federal dollars. That translates into the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employees every year just doing the paperwork. This bureaucratic maze for Federal education bureaucracy takes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars.If I were to hand my son $1 and before it got from my hand to his it changed from $1 to 65 cents, I would hear about it. I would hear about it with justification--``You say you are giving me a dollar. You are only giving me 65 cents.'' That is what has been happening with Federal education dollars.The Governors of the country know about it. That is why they were so adamant in unanimously supporting the Ed-Flex bill which we passed in the Senate. Flexibility is important. That is what we would be providing to support student achievement if we are able to support this amendment.A recent example of inflexible Federal funding is the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for early elementary grades. It may have been a noble aspiration, but it may not be what some schools need.Listen to what Gov. Gray Davis, a Democratic Governor of California, recently said. He said it this way. His State had already achieved smaller classroom sizes in the early grades and needed to use the new Federal funds for reducing class size in 10th grade math and English classes. But no. The Federal bureaucrats and we, in conjunction with them, said no; this is only to be used in another specific arena.Let's give the flexibility to a school district, to the Governors, to teachers, to principals, to people at the local level. Let's give them the flexibility to meet student needs instead of to satisfy the bureaucratic demand. Why should we handcuff States and local schools from using money in the way they best see fit?According to the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress Reading Report Card, nearly 40 percent of our fourth grade students cannot even read at a basic level. United States 12th graders outperformed only 2 out of 21 nations in mathematics on a recent Third International Math and Science Study Test. The Brookings Institution has reported that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students who want to go to college. They have to have remedial work because it didn't happen at the elementary and secondary level.Let's not continue to spend money, Federal funds, in the old way of running it through the bureaucracy, first shrinking it and then allowing it to go from the bureaucracy forward in ways that aren't serving students. We should direct any new and existing Federal education resources to States and local schools to design and implement education programs that work, and that they know can work, because they are working with the program. And they also know what programs they need for their students.When Governor Gray Davis said he didn't need the money for smaller class sizes in early grades, he wasn't saying the program wouldn't work. He is just saying we already did that; we need to use the resource for something else.We cannot afford to keep spending our dollars in the same way that we have been doing for years. A profound friend of mine said, ``Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. If you do not like what you are getting, you had better change your system.''We can't do it the same way. It has been giving us the wrong results. Let's let States and local communities decide how to spend dollars to improve performance--not give us the same result but give us an elevated outcome.I think we should give States and local schools the kind of flexibility they need to spend Federal dollars on programs that are needed at the local level rather than programs that are mandated from the bureaucracy. I think we need programs that boost student achievement, and that somehow foster academic excellence, giving local individuals the right to deploy the resources to do that.Under this approach, schools will be able to deploy resources to hire new teachers and to raise teachers' salaries. They could buy textbooks, or new computers, enhance the library, or even build--do all kinds of things, whatever they believe is most important in order to achieve that fundamental goal that we will all agree we want to pursue: that is, elevated student performance.That is what education is for--not for the bureaucracy in Washington. It is not really even for the bureaucracies at the State level, or the school boards, or even for the teachers. Our education effort is designed to elevate the performance and capacity to build the future of the United States by enhancing the future of individual students.In conclusion, parents, teachers, school boards, and administrators are in the best position to say what is needed. You wouldn't think of going to a doctor who is 1,000 miles away who is prescribing only one thing for all the people in the country regardless of their symptoms. We would say that is the most foolish thing of all. Yet we go to the bureaucracy in Washington, have them prescribe what we are going to do with our educational resources, no matter what the situation is in the State, or the school, or the local school area, or in the classroom. We need the capacity to say, here is what is wrong. Let's make the diagnosis at the local level, and then let's get at the problem at the local level.We can provide those resources. The resources in this budget should be devoted to that. Senator Gorton of Washington has been a champion of this idea. Several years ago, really in a breakthrough in the Senate, we voted for this concept, and it was on his motion that we did so. I am pleased to join with him in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Sessions as a cosponsor of this amendment. There may be others as well.,2015-03-16 18:10:31.599067,2015-03-16 18:10:31.599067,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000,1999-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-25/html/CREC-1999-03-25-pt1-PgS3327-2.htm,48,141,145,S3327-S3380,A000356,mr. ashcroft
498,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, last year, Congress passed the omnibus appropriations bill, making a $1.2 billion down payment on President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new classroom teachers. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans because overwhelming evidence demonstrates that students in smaller classes with qualified teachers have greater academic success, especially in the early grades.H.R. 1995, the Teacher Empowerment Act, threatens the future of this class size reduction program by allowing funds to be diverted to other uses without having to address the shame of overcrowded classrooms.Only on rare occasions have there been such unanimous opposition in the education community to a proposal such as this one. Every major education group has expressed strong opposition to abolishing the requirement to target funding for class size reduction.Now, Mr. Chairman, the people who drafted this bill are all isolated here in Washington, D.C. and want everybody to think that they have the answers to the problems in public education, but a sampling of such comments from people who are out there in the trenches, who are out there every day dealing with the problems of education, is something that we ought to pay attention to.The Council of Chief State School Officers say that they support the Martinez Democratic substitute because, and I quote, ``H.R. 1995 fails to ensure a stable and growing funding stream of resources for both professional development and class size reduction. The Martinez substitute would target Federal resources to two distinct but companion Federal priorities without making them compete against each other for a fixed pot of funds,'' end of quote.The National Education Association writes, and I quote, ``NEA strongly opposes provisions of H.R. 1995 to combine the class size reduction program with Goals 2000 and professional development programs. Combining class size reduction with other programs will serve merely to undermine its effectiveness by failing to achieve the goal of hiring 100,000 qualified teachers,'' end of quote.The National School Boards Association, representing thousands of school districts across the country, opposes the approach taken in this bill. They write, and I quote, Mr. Chairman, ``Much stronger legislation and far more targeted Federal dollars are needed if the Nation's public schools are to ensure that students, particularly those in poverty, have a real opportunity to improve student achievement. H.R. 1995 implies that America's school board members must make the unfortunate choice between access to high-quality teachers and access to an effective learning environment with a teacher ratio that research has proven is effective,'' end of quote.Other groups, Mr. Chairman, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Council of Great City Schools, the National Parent and Teachers Association, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights all strongly support a separate stream of funding for class size reduction.Finally, Mr. Chairman, President Clinton on the recommendation of Secretary Riley has issued a veto threat on this bill. All across the country children, parents, and teachers are counting on us to finish the job of reducing class sizes. The Martinez substitute that will be offered later today makes good on this commitment by continuing a separate stream of support for the Clay-Clinton Class Size Reduction Act.Mr. Chairman, too many of our students and teachers are now struggling in classrooms with as many as 35 children. We should not let them down. I urge support of the Martinez substitute and, if it fails, I urge rejection of H.R. 1995.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:10:31.720130,2015-03-16 18:10:31.720130,House,TEACHER EMPOWERMENT ACT,1999-07-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-07-20/html/CREC-1999-07-20-pt1-PgH5856-2.htm,103,67,145,H5856-H5919,C000488,mr. clay
499,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a native St. Louisan, Dr. Henry Givens, Jr., who has served as president of Harris-Stowe State University since it became a state institution in 1979. He was educated in the St. Louis public schools and earned his baccalaureate degree at Lincoln University in Missouri. He earned his master's degree at the University of Illinois and his Ph.D. at Saint Louis University. His postdoctoral studies in higher education administration were at Harvard University.Dr. Givens' professional experience in education is both broad and varied. He began his career as a teacher in the Webster Groves School District and became principal of the first prototype of a magnet school in the nation. Before leaving the Webster Groves public schools, he held the post of Assistant to the Superintendent of Schools. Soon after, he became the first African-American to serve Missouri as Assistant Commissioner of Education, which he did for 5 years.At the request of the Governor of Missouri, Dr. Givens served as interim president at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, MO, during a financial crisis in 1987, while continuing his duties at Harris-Stowe. Such an appointment was without precedent in Missouri public higher education.Under the leadership of Dr. Givens, Harris-Stowe has greatly expanded its degree programs; has significantly increased its facilities--from one building to seven, and including, for the first time in its long history of over 150 years, the new state-of-the-art William L. Clay, Sr. Early Childhood Development/Parenting Education Center and the Rev. Dr. William G. Gillespie Residence Hall and Student Center. An eighth new building, a second residence hall, is currently under construction. In addition, Harris-Stowe has opened its first business school satellite campus in South St. Louis; has expanded the University's academic program to include 14 degree offerings in selected applied professional disciplines; has tripled its student enrollment since entering the State System; and has changed its status from College to University, to name a few of its accomplishments.Dr. Givens has served as Chairman of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Statewide Celebration Commission for Missouri since its inception in 1986 to 2011. Under his dynamic leadership, the State of Missouri now hosts the second-largest celebration in the nation, extending to every corner of Missouri. Dr. Givens was appointed by President Barack Obama to the HBCU Capital Finance Program Advisory Board, and has served in the past and present on local, national, and international groups as a consultant, including the U.S. State Department at its American School in Lima, Peru. In addition, he currently serves on several local, state and national Boards and Commissions. He serves on the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority board, and on local and national Corporate Boards of Directors, including, U.S. Bank (Regional).He is a past board member of Laclede Gas/Laclede Group, Peabody Energy, Inc., and Automobile Club of Missouri (AAA). President Givens is affiliated with numerous national and local professional and social organizations, and has received over 125 national, state and local awards and recognitions, including honorary doctorate degrees from Saint Louis University, Lincoln University and Washington University-St. Louis.Dr. Givens is married to Belma Evans Givens. They have a daughter, a son, and three grandchildren. ,2015-03-16 18:10:31.850244,2015-03-16 18:10:31.850244,Extensions,HONORING HENRY GIVENS, JR., PH.D., PRESIDENT, HARRIS-STOWE STATE UNIVERSITY, SAINT LOUIS, MISSOURI,2011-09-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-09-09/html/CREC-2011-09-09-pt1-PgE1587-3.htm,133,0,157,E1587-E1588,C001049,mr. clay
500,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, in introducing the Real AMT Relief Act of 2001. This bill focuses on an issue of growing concern to many individual taxpayers and especially small business owners, the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT.The Real AMT Relief Act addresses the increasingly onerous consequences of the individual AMT as well as the corporate AMT. According to the Joint Tax Committee, in 1998, the most recent taxpayer data available, there were 853,000 individual tax returns that paid AMT. That number constituted 0.7 percent of all individual income tax returns--a relatively small number of returns. In contrast, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that by 2011, 11.2 percent of individual income tax returns will have AMT liability, that's more than 16 million taxpayers who will have to grapple with this burdensome tax.Sadly, many of these AMT taxpayers will be individuals in the middle income brackets and not because they are taking advantage of special tax loopholes to avoid paying their share of taxes. No, these hardworking men and women will be hit with the AMT because they are taking advantage of the tax benefits that Congress accorded them, such as the child tax credit, the adoption tax credit, the dependent care tax credit, and the HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit, to name a few. So instead of receiving a few extra dollars to help raise their children, these taxpayers lose much of these benefits and get to deal with the complex AMT rules as a bonus prize.For other taxpayers, the AMT will not increase their tax bill. But because the AMT is a separate tax system, they will have to calculate their taxes twice, once under the regular rules and a second time under the AMT, just to make sure they do not owe additional taxes. With an already complicated set of tax rules for the regular tax, the last thing these individuals need is a second set of calculations.Another significant group of taxpayers who have largely been forgotten in the AMT debate are the small business owners. According to recent IRS estimates, there were more than 20.7 million tax returns filed by sole-proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations with receipts of less than $1 million. In contrast, there were 2.75 million C corporations. As a result, a whopping 88 percent of these businesses, with receipts under $1 million, are pass-through entities, businesses that are taxed only at the individual owner level.For these sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, the individual AMT increases their tax liability by, among other things, reducing depreciation and depletion deductions, limiting net operating loss treatment, eliminating the deductibility of State and local taxes, and curtailing the expensing of research and experimentation costs. In addition, because of its complexity, this tax forces small business owners to waste precious funds on tax professionals to determine whether the AMT even applies. Just think of the economic growth and new jobs that could be created if we could eliminate the compliance costs of the individual AMT.The Real AMT Relief Act does just that. Based on the recommendation of the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate in his 2001 Report to Congress, the bill provides for the complete repeal of the individual AMT. This will be accomplished by eliminating 20 percent of the AMT each year until it is completely repealed in 2006. That's welcome relief for individual taxpayers and an enormous burden lifted off the shoulders of America's small businesses.For small corporations, the AMT story is much the same, high compliance costs and additional taxes draining away scarce capital from their businesses. In fact, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, received testimony at a hearing in the last Congress that the corporate AMT resulted in a $95,000 tax bill for one small business in Kansas City, all because the company purchased life insurance on the father, who was the primary owner of the business, to prevent the estate tax from closing the company down. That type of nonsense must come to an end here and now.In 1997, Congress established an exemption from the corporate AMT for small businesses that are organized as taxable corporations if they meet certain gross receipt tests. Under that exemption, a corporation initially qualifies if its average gross receipts were $5 million or less during its first three taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. Thereafter, a small corporation can continue to qualify for the AMT exemption for so long as its average gross receipts for the prior three-year period do not exceed $7.5 million.With the growth and success of small corporations, it is time to expand that exemption and continue to provide these small enterprises with relief from the corporate AMT. Accordingly, for small corporate taxpayers, the Real AMT Relief Act increases the current exemption from the corporate AMT. As a result, a small corporation will initially qualify for the exemption if its average gross receipts are $7.5 million or less during its first three taxable years. In subsequent years, a small corporation will continue to qualify for as long as its average gross receipts for the prior 3-year period do not exceed $10 million. By Mr. COCHRAN:S. 617. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve student and teacher performance and access to education in the critically challenged Lower Mississippi Delta region; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, today I am introducing the Lower Mississippi Delta Education Access and Improvement Act of 2001.The character and fabric of our Nation have been significantly enhanced by the Mississippi Delta's unique blend of the talents that created blues music and Pulitzer Prize literature. But the problems facing this region today overshadow the triumphs of the past and foretell a future without hope. These problems include: below average reading skills among elementary school children, low graduation rates and ACT scores among high school students, lower levels of accreditation among teachers, and poor scores from the State Department of Education Performance Based Accreditation System. Poverty is another issue facing the school districts, evidenced by the fact that 86 percent of the students are eligible for free lunch.However, there is a sense of optimism among community leaders and educators about overcoming the difficulties that confront the educational system of the area. Universities, community based organizations, and schools are developing comprehensive initiatives to achieve new success in teacher training and retention, preschool learning readiness, parental education, school-wide performance, birth to kindergarten preventative health care and immunization delivery. These are the people who best know their problems, and more importantly, how to solve them. In my opinion, these are efforts that deserve federal support.This bill will authorize grants to institutions of higher learning located in the Lower Mississippi Delta for the improvement of education and student and teacher performance.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,Title XIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:Title XIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Part E--Lower Mississippi Delta Education Access and Improvement,2015-03-16 18:10:31.973304,2015-03-16 18:10:31.973304,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2001-03-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-26/html/CREC-2001-03-26-pt1-PgS2895.htm,41,14,147,S2895-S2904,B000611,mr. bond
501,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, when the Black Leadership Forum decided to finance the settlement of the Taxman v. Pascataway, many outside the civil rights community asked ``why?''. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments and the case was said to be perfect for an argument in defense of affirmative action--both applicant were allegedly ``equally'' qualified. This was a total distortion of the facts. The candidates were NOT equally qualified. Debra Williams, the African-American teacher, had significantly higher academic credentials than did the other teacher. I submit an insightful column that accurately sets forth the real issue in the Piscataway case. The column was written by the distinguished economist, columnist, and educator Dr. Julianne Malveaux and appeared in the December 11, 1997 issue of Black Issues in Higher Education.The Black Leadership Forum--an organization that includes the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Urban League, the National Council of Negro Women, and others--deflected energy from the controversial Taxman v. Piscataway case that the Supreme Court had committed to hear this session. The forum agreed to finance 70 percent of the nearly $450,000 settlement that the plaintiff and her lawyers will receive from the Piscataway school board. Sharon Taxman was the White business education teacher who was laid off in a downsizing while Debra Williams, an African American business education teacher, was retained. Since the two women were hired the same day and deemed ``equally'' qualified, the school board justified retaining Williams on the basis of ``diversity.'' Faster than she could spell diverse, Taxman was filing a lawsuit. Her quest for ``equality'' was affirmed by every court up to the Supreme Court, which had agreed to hear her case. Civil rights activists thought this was the wrong one to take to the nation's highest court, so they bought Taxman out. I'm not sure how I feel about the buy-out. It's like postponing something tragic--in this case, the apathy that comes from a Supreme Court which appears to be indifferent to diversity as well as equality. But I am convinced that there are at least two villains in this story--and one of them is the Piscataway School Board. Come again? To some, these guys seem like the good guys. They retained an African American teacher and laid off a White one, upholding diversity. At the same time, though, they tragically argued that two workers were ``equally'' qualified when one held a master's degree while the other had a lesser education. If we were Debra Williams I'd be fuming through the ears. The myth that hard work and the quest for education would give you a leg up was busted in her case. Rather than the school board affirming her superior education, they told her that her master's degree was not worth enough for her to be considered more than equally qualified over a colleague with less education. (I almost typed inferior for less, but that is the oppressor's game.) A careful examination of what happened in Piscataway explains why affirmative action has become America's whipping post. Instead of White employers telling White employees that they aren't competitive, the White employees are told that a position was assigned or retained because of affirmative action. That is the kind of lazy dishonesty that fuels the myth of White superiority. Consider Proposition 209. We all know that it was championed by Republicans Pete Wilson and Ward Connerly, but the early poster boys were two White men who presented themselves as academics and said they could not find jobs in the California State University system, despite their ``qualifications.'' To be sure, these men both had Ph.D. degrees. However, neither had earned academic distinction. They were not published, nor had they ever actually applied for jobs in the California state system--a fact uncovered in a blistering report by investigative journalists. Nonetheless, one of these men said he could not find a job as a philosophy teacher in California. In the year he said he looked, five philosophers were hired, and three were White men. But he didn't challenge their status. There was an eminently qualified White woman hired, and he didn't challenge her status either. And an African American woman, also hired, was not the target of his ire. Where was this undistinguished, unpublished, nonapplying product of our nation's system of higher education supposed to get a job? It didn't matter. In his warped mind, some mythical Black person was out there holding his job--and by golly, he was going to make affirmative action beneficiaries pay. Thus, Proposition 209. Enter the second villain of this New Jersey-spawned affair. Taxman must have her head in the sand. Hasn't she ever heard that people lose their jobs. Spit happens, and the best thing to do with spit is to wash it off and move on. Instead, she put her life on hold, apparently because she could not stand the notion that some Black woman should get a job she thought she should have. Never mind that the Black woman, her colleague, had more education. Never mind that her colleague was the better teacher. Taxman is White and she has wrapped herself in the privilege of Whiteness. Thus, her lawsuit. The Supreme Court wouldn't see that because they are mostly White, too. Those who opposed Taxman would have had to overcome both the Court's distaste for affirmative action-- and its pejorative description of such policies as ``race- based preferences''--as well as a fealty to Whiteness. The civil rights community bought Taxman off because they understood that the Piscataway school board improperly packaged this case, choosing affirmative action and diversity as the wrong reasons to let an inferior teacher go. If the school board had looked more carefully at the two women and their qualifications, this case may not have gone to court. There's the rub. Spit happens. Downsizing takes place. What the Taxman case has said so far is that when downsizing doesn't fall on the shoulders of Black people, White people are ready to go to court. Or when all else is supposedly equal, White folks are supposed to prevail. This is a premise that deserves challenge. But then there are others, such as the premise that a White woman's bachelor's degree is the equivalent of a Black woman's master's. That is only the case in a racist society.,2015-03-16 18:11:36.266012,2015-03-16 18:11:36.266012,Extensions,THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TAXMAN V.

502,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I want to share with my colleagues some concerns and views on this very important piece of legislation, S. 717, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. I express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the committee for the good work he and the ranking member and the entire committee have done on this bill.We all know that since the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, tremendous improvements have been made in the lives of millions of children with disabilities, providing them with a full array of outstanding educational services to meet their individual needs.Mr. President, going back about a year before that, in the State of Missouri, when I was Governor, we passed our Special Education Act in 1974, one of the first major pieces of legislation adopted during my first term as Governor. House bill 474 was an effort at the State level to assure that children with disabilities received educational opportunities and received educational services that were designed to meet their abilities and to compensate for any difficulties or deficiencies they might have.I think it is clear that we have come a long way. Clearly, there was much that needed to be done, and many of those children, with grave needs, were not being taken care of, they were not being served, and certainly they have a right to be served.I think as we move through this bill, preserving the rights of special-needs children to a free appropriate public education so that they can become productive and responsible citizens is an absolutely essential goal that we must keep in mind.I have had the opportunity to hear from many, many groups in Missouri who are concerned about how this bill is being carried out, how IDEA is being implemented. Without dissent, there is unanimous agreement that the goals are worthy, the objectives are right, the need is there, more needs to be done. Unfortunately, because of the way the law has been carried out, the way it has been interpreted, there are disruptions to classrooms, there is needless danger to other students and to teachers in the classroom, and there is also a shortage of funds to carry out the worthwhile objectives of this act.As I traveled throughout Missouri over the last couple of weekends when I was home, I talked with school superintendents, principals, school board members, special education directors, parents and others who are concerned, and the two top concerns that were mentioned just about every place I went was safety and discipline for all students in the public school system.The number of instances where there have been serious disruption and violent acts on students was hair raising. There was a lot of interest and focus in the St. Louis area on a tragic murder that occurred in one of the schools. A young woman was brutally beaten to death. It turns out that the young man who commited the crime was a young man with disabilities. He had transferred into that school district from another school district where he had been cited many times for bad behavior. The receiving school district did not know anything about his past activities because they did not know about his behavioral problems. So the first thing they requested was that they get information on a student's past activities, if there has been discipline, what the discipline had been and why the discipline was administered.Second, they told me some hair-raising stories about children with disabilities who committed violent acts. In one classroom, in a commercial art class, a young man picked up a knife and stabbed a fellow student several times and told the school administrators that since he qualified under a certain specific section of the act, they couldn't do anything to him, that they could only take him out of the classroom for 10 days, and then he would be back in there.They told me about another student, one of two students, who had been apprehended for selling drugs. The one student who did not have a disability was expelled for 175 days. The other student, a year later, was still in the classroom. His parents had retained an attorney, which the school district was paying for, and they carried on the process. A year later, that student who sold the drugs was still in the classroom.Earlier, I introduced legislation, the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, which is designed to do a couple of things: No. 1 is to create a safe learning environment for all children. We have to continue to provide support and assistance for disabled students, but where there is a clear-cut example of behavior that is incompatible with a decent learning environment, the schools have to be able to take some action. One principal told us, ``You cannot learn in chaos. A child cannot learn in chaos. A teacher cannot teach in chaos.''When they have students with disabilities whose violent acts have been judged to be a manifestation of their disability and they have to come back into the classroom after 10 days, other students live in fear, teachers are apprehensive about the impact on their class and, according to the teachers, the administrators, the parents, the job of education comes to a halt.The measure that I introduced, the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, will eliminate the double standard that currently exists between special education and general education children. All children, disabled or not, should receive the same discipline for the same behavior. I believe this is appropriate wherein the behavior of the child is not related to the disability. Children must learn that there are consequences for violating the rules. Good education means discipline and standards of conduct. If there is a violent act that is a manifestation of the disability, if it is a dangerous act, if it is a violent act, then that child ought to be put in a learning situation where there will not be a danger to fellow students of committing a similar act.In addition, this measure would require schools to include in the record of a child with a disability a statement of any disciplinary action taken against the student, and that should be available for a student transferring within a State or from State to State, so that the receiving school will know if there are problems with the student who has come to them.The record issue, as I indicated previously, has been brought to the forefront because of the tragic murder of a young woman in north St. Louis County.This measure that I have proposed will enable the school administrators to remove dangerous children with disabilities who pose a threat to the safety of others from the classroom and make temporary alternative placements to ensure that the safety of all students is secure until a more appropriate placement is determined.In addition, the current IDEA provision requiring local school districts to reimburse attorneys fees incurred by parents who elect to initiate litigation has had what, unfortunately, is a predictable result of encouraging litigation and of driving up special education costs. It appears that the dispute-resolution procedures have become extremely adversarial and costly. Studies have found that the amount of special education litigation has dramatically increased in recent years. Too often, the litigation can be used as a fishing expedition to threaten districts with protracted litigation.The practice serves to reduce district funds available to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and we clearly need reforms of the dispute-resolution process to ensure that scarce educational funds are used for educational services for the children for whom they were intended. But because of the explosion of litigation in this area, educational services for students are put at risk.Under the measure I introduced, local school districts would be permitted to provide alternative education placements to children who threaten the safety of others. For some children, it is absolutely appropriate to remove them swiftly and permanently from the regular classroom setting. And under the law that I proposed, school officials would be permitted, on their own authority, to discipline dangerous and unruly students.Again, the measure I introduced would give the school districts the authority and flexibility to ensure that the students and the personnel are provided educational and working environments that are safe and orderly.Finally, I point out that when the Federal Government enacted IDEA, it promised to fund 40 percent of the national average per-pupil expenditure. Today, the Federal Government funds only 7 percent. That is why I am very pleased today to join with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, to provide in this legislation explicit direction to Congress to fund fully IDEA.I congratulate the committee and its leadership for having made so many necessary reforms in the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I hope we can take the next very important step and assure the funding. Congress only recently has come up with 7 percent of the funding rather than 40 percent.Last week, a major network news story featured a story on a school in my home State in Maryville, MO. The Maryville R-II School District did not have the revenue to repair its deteriorating classrooms. After six unsuccessful attempts to pass local bond issues, the district was able to pass a bond issue to renovate the schools.The Maryville school district spends approximately $434,800 on special education, of which $68,200 is Federal funds, all of which is spent on mandates. If the district were not bound by the paperwork requirements and other costly mandates of the law, they would have more money to improve their facilities and their classrooms.The skyrocketing costs of our special-needs children being served by IDEA places local school districts in a bind with little assistance from the Federal Government.An Economic Policy Institute study on school funding found that new money for education went disproportionately to fund deficits in special education funding caused by increasing requirements for services coupled with the Federal failure to meet its promised commitment.We have been in this body in an effort sometimes called devolution, sometimes called enhanced federalism, more often, in my view, called the commonsense approach of letting the level of Government which delivers the service make the decisions.Over the last few years, it says we ought to be allowing the school district if it is an educational decision, or the water district if it is a water-related problem, or the justice system if it is a justice problem make the decisions of how it works.We need to be providing more resources and less good ideas to local governments. That is particularly important in this field with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I can tell you that the goals and the objectives are understood, they are strongly felt by the people who serve in the school system and who support the school system, but they have too many requirements that prevent them from getting the job done. That is why I think we need to provide some flexibility for local school districts. We need to reestablish and restore to local school districts, to school administrators, and others the ability to use common sense in maintaining discipline and order and safety in the classroom.We also in this body need to step up to the plate and make sure that we come through with the funding that is needed to carry out these mandates.When I talked with the school principals, administrators, and teachers, I said, ``After what you have told me, we need to give you some freedom to do these things.'' They said, ``Well, how about a little money to help us with the burdens you put on us?'' I said, ``That makes sense.'' They said, ``Look, to handle these children with disabilities who are violent, we need to have the resources to provide them the alternative education which is appropriate for them and which will not subject their fellow students to risks.'' It is going to be more expensive, and there is not the money there yet.I am hoping that if we can increase the funding that is needed for these services, we are going to see not only order and discipline and conduct restored in the normal classrooms but a much higher quality of educational services delivered to the children with disabilities.Again, I commend and thank the committee for making the many reforms it has done in this bill. And I say that the School Improvement Security Act of 1997, which I described briefly, most of which is very significantly incorporated in this measure--I have been advised that the following organizations strongly support the provisions of it: The Missouri School Boards Association, the Missouri Association of Elementary School Principals, the Missouri Association of Secondary Principals, the Missouri State Teachers Association, the Missouri Federation of Teachers &amp; School Related Personnel, the Fort Zumwalt School District.I think, I say to the chairman, that we could get a list a half-mile long of organizations in my State that are behind you in the efforts to reform and reauthorize this measure. I know they are going to be behind Senator Gregg's and my efforts to get more funding.So I congratulate you on the measure. We look forward to working with you. We want to see if there is a way that we can provide the funding that is so badly needed for this very important service and for the well-being of the entire educational system in our country.I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished managers of the bill.I yield the floor.Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.,2015-03-16 18:11:36.436126,2015-03-16 18:11:36.436126,Senate,INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-05-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-05-12/html/CREC-1997-05-12-pt1-PgS4295-3.htm,61,45,143,S4295-S4311,B000611,mr. bond
503,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the many accomplishments of Catholic schools. On January 26 the annual weeklong national recognition of Catholic schools began across the Nation. I am proud to have several of the nation's high achieving Catholic schools in my district in metropolitan Kansas City, Missouri. As a former educator I understand the importance of recognizing the achievements of education throughout our Nation, and I welcome this opportunity to applaud the Catholic school community nationwide.For 165 years, the Catholic schools of the Kansas City Diocese have prepared thousands of competent young adults fully for lives as productive citizens. There are over 40 Catholic education centers in metropolitan Kansas City, and they are all known for their high academic standards and rigorous educational instruction. These centers currently serve 14,000 students in my district. Every day over 1,000 dedicated faculty offer the guidance and instruction that make these students some of the best the Nation has to offer. Not only do the metropolitan Kansas City Catholic schools promote excellence in the classroom, they also encourage community service. In the first semester of this school year, our 14,000 students offered 87,978 hours of service to their communities by working to combat hunger and to provide care for the elderly.One of the brightest educational beacons in the Kansas City Diocese is St. Elizabeth School in Kansas City. They are recipients of the prestigious Blue Ribbon Award from the United States Department of Education. The award recognizes St. Elizabeth's for exceeding local, State, and national education goals. I participated in the announcement of this award and was overjoyed to see the level of excellence embodied throughout the school. They expressed their gratitude by giving me a remembrance of our day together: a Kelly green sweatshirt that I cherish, especially in St. Patrick's Day parades.St. Teresa's Academy, another blue ribbon school of excellence in my community, is the oldest school and women's institution in Kansas City. The school was founded and is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet who, since their founding in the 17th century in France, have been in the forefront of preparing young women for the future.I had the pleasure of accompanying the Secretary of Education, Roderick Paige, to St. Francis Xavier School in Kansas City, St. Francis is one of the seven Central City Catholic Schools established by the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph to provide educational support to children of the urban core of Kansas City. It serves a diverse population of students, some of whom are Catholic, but all come to receive their outstanding educational instruction offered as a part of the St. Francis Xavier curriculum. There is also a commitment to serving the whole child. More than half of the students at St. Francis qualify for free or reduced lunch. The school also participates in partnership with community organizations, including the Rockhurst University School of Education for teacher and parent training; Rockhurst High School in establishing a ``Middle School Academy'' to align curriculum, share resources, and setting up a mentoring program; and Young Audiences, to enrich the curriculum through the arts by having visual and performing artists work with teachers. St. Francis is part of the President's Service alliance and all students are required to perform community service. St. Francis students get real life experiences as part of their curriculum through partnerships the teachers establish with the community. The students also have a connection to students in the global society fostering the development of cultural awareness.I have also visited St. Thomas More School for a presentation by 6th Graders on the Federal minimum wage. This was part of a class project titled ``That is Not Fair,'' a program which emphasizes social justice issues. I was accompanied by Brigid Flanigan, principal; Leanna Kilgore, Cindy Rapp, Barbara Mingori, and Paula Pawlewicz, 6 grade teachers; Ann Harbin, facilitator of the ``That's Not Fair program; and Michael Poulin, social justice program coordinator. After listening to the presentation and hearing the students' hopes and aspirations of the future I challenged the students to reach high and achieve their goals. With the first rate education provided by St. Thomas More and throughout the Kansas City Diocese, there is no question that they will be prepared to do just that.Mr. Speaker, these are but a few of the Catholic schools in metropolitan Kansas City which play an important role in gifting students with the abilities to excel academically, socially, and civically. And I ask all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating the legacy and the bright future of the Catholic schools in the 5th District of Missouri and of the Nation.,2015-03-16 18:11:36.591236,2015-03-16 18:11:36.591236,House,HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2003-01-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-01-27/html/CREC-2003-01-27-pt1-PgH143-7.htm,14,17,149,H143-H147,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
504,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, as we gather in the House chamber with tremendous sadness over the passing of our dear friend and colleague, the Honorable Patsy Mink of Hawaii, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the career of a distinguished public servant who dedicated her life to the people of Hawaii and the United States.Patsy graduated valedictorian of her Maui High School class and received a bachelor's degree in zoology and chemistry from the University of Hawaii and a law degree from the University of Chicago, graduating as only one of two women in a class of 200. She practiced law and turned her sights to public service while mobilizing the Democratic party to take control of the Hawaii territorial government in the mid-1950s. From that time, Patsy served as an elected representative in the territorial and state legislatures, a city councilwoman, a federal official, and a Member of Congress.In Congress, as a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, she consistently championed legislation that would improve education, child care, welfare, and gender equality. Patsy was an especially fierce advocate for women's issues and was instrumental in the creation of Title 9 of the federal education act, which has opened many opportunities for women athletes in schools and colleges across America.Patsy also cared deeply about the men and women who serve in our nation's military. The State of Hawaii and its citizens play an instrumental role in advancing U.S. national security presence throughout the Pacific region. As a representative from Hawaii Patsy recognized the important military function in her state, and promoted the welfare of our troops and their families.As members of the House pay tribute to the legacy of this stateswoman, we should also take a moment to thank Patsy's staff in Washington and in Hawaii for their hard work and dedication. Because Patsy's office neighbors mine in the Rayburn building, I have seen her staff members burning the midnight oil on more than one occasion. With several time zones between Washington and Hawaii, they have often worked long hours to get the job done.Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Patsy Mink was a remarkable person who always stood for what she believed. She was a strong, brave American who is a role model for women throughout the nation. Most importantly, however, Patsy was a dear friend, and I will miss her. My wife Susie and I offer our condolences to Patsy's husband, John, and to their daughter Wendy.Mr. DAVIS of Illinois, Mr. Speaker, for those who knew her, Patsy Mink was a tiny woman physically. But don't let appearances fool you--Patsy Mink was a giant. This Nation has lost a great public servant and a true crusader for social justice. For 74 years, every time she came to a door that was slammed tightly closed--for no good reason--she used those tiny feet of hers to kick it open--and to let others follow behind her.And those who benefited from her tenacity have not forgotten Patsy Mink's pioneering steps. The National Organization for Women, in its tribute to Representative Mink, wrote ``Girls and women . . . lost one of their most valiant and steadfast champions. Every woman today who is enjoying the fruits of her education and job opportunities, and every girl who has a chance to play sports in school, owes a nod of thanks to Mink who unremittingly and dauntlessly challenged old stereotypes about `women's place' and helped engineer the steady progress for women over the last four decades--parallel to Mink's career in politics.''Patsy Mink was born in Maui, Hawaii, in December 1927, and began her political career when she ran for and won the election for student body president during her junior year in high school--she was the first girl to run. She later went on to graduate as the class valedictorian of Maui High School--but her academic achievement became less important than her race and sex when she set off to college. She attended Wilson College, in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and then the University of Nebraska, where she faced segregated student housing. Patsy Mink worked with others to end this discriminatory policy. She returned to finish her studies in chemistry and zoology from the University of Hawaii in 1948, with full intentions of attending medical school. However, 20 medical schools rejected her--obviously, it was not because of her grades, but because they would not accept women.She then decided to go to law school, and graduated with her J.D. degree in 1951 from the University of Chicago. Ironically enough, she was accepted into the school because they hadn't realized that Hawaii was an American territory at the time, and she was accepted as a foreign student!Armed with her law degree, Patsy Mink returned to Hawaii and became the first Asian American woman to practice law, the first Asian American woman elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, and then the first Asian American woman to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. For 24 years over two different periods she served in this body, and was re-elected two years ago by two-to-one margin. Incidentally, when she arrived in Congress, she wasn't allowed in the House gym because it was a male-only venue.As a champion for civil rights, family rights, education, civil liberties, and equal rights and opportunities, Rep. Mink will be remembered for many things. She wrote the Women's Educational Equity Act, sponsored the first Early Childhood Education Act, and was a passionate advocate for poor families, supporting measures to provide education and skills to assist families. However, her most crowning achievement was Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By prohibiting schools that receive Federal funding from discriminating because of sex, Title IX has singularly been credited with changing the face of education and sports for American women--and opening up many of those closed doors. There are many who believe we would not have seen such a rise in women's athletics were it not for Title IX.Rep Mink said of Title IX: ``It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition . . . To be frank, I thought this was great, a beginning statement of policy and intent. At the moment we were doing it, we didn't think it would have this fantastic momentum and the enforcement of the courts.''I think The Honolulu Advertiser summed it up right when it said: ``In a day when politics appears driven by polls and focus groups, Mink stood out as a politician who was true, first and foremost, to herself and the people she served.''I will truly miss working with Patsy Mink, but I am honored to have served with her. She set the standard for public servants, and leaves some very big shoes to fill.,2015-03-16 18:11:36.735366,2015-03-16 18:11:36.735366,House,EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PATSY T.

505,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing two major education bills that address both elementary and secondary, and higher education.Last week I cosponsored President Clinton's Hope Scholarship proposal because I support the President's commitment to help parents finance their kids' education. Admittedly, I have concerns that the President's plan does not provide enough assistance for low-income families.My view is that the most fair and effective way to improve college access and affordability for low-income families is through strengthening the Pell Grant program. That is why today I will introduce the College Access and Affordability Act of 1997.As the chart to my immediate right illustrates, the value of Pell Grants has substantially decreased in recent years. In current dollars, the value of the maximum Pell Grant was over $4,000. Sadly, it is only $2,700 today. Our bill increases the maximum Pell Grant through mandatory spending to $3,300 for fiscal year 1998, and $300 a year thereafter, through fiscal year 2002. The net effect of the fiscal year 1998 increase would be that 3.6 million additional students would receive an increase of up to $600, and an additional 215,000 families would become newly eligible for Pell.My bill contains a number of other very important features including elimination of student loan origination fees, loan forgiveness for students who take teaching jobs in low-income public schools, and extension of special rules afforded historically black colleges and universities with regard to participation in student loan programs, and also included in here is a change to the Pell needs analysis that will help older, independent students and students working their way through college.My second proposal addresses the growing movement in local communities to recognize that some of our public schools need renewal. Those pushing vouchers are capitalizing on growing parental anxiety about their children's education. As a supporter of public schools, I am not content with just saying no to vouchers. Therefore, the second bill I will introduce today is the Public Schools Renewal and Improvement Act of 1997. Here are some of its key features: A local consortium, composed of the local educational agency and a group of parents, students, representatives of teachers and school employees, community and business leaders and others, may submit a request to the President for a declaration that a major public schools renewal effort is underway in that community.As part of its request, the consortium must prepare and submit a 3-year locally inspired public schools renewal plan that spells out specific details concerning the consortium's commitment to public school renewal in such areas as parental involvement, training of teachers, administrators and counselors, technology enhancements, school and classroom safety, and truancy and drop-out prevention.The President, along with the Secretary of Education, may approve the consortium's request for assistance and may direct various types of Federal assistance, including not just dollars, but also equipment, infrastructure improvements, et cetera.My bill is a 3-year effort and I am requesting $750 million for the first and second years. I intend to pursue passage of both bills at every opportunity, including work on the budget and higher education reauthorization.Increases Pell Grants. The bill increases the maximum Pell Grant through mandatory spending to $3,300 for FY 1998, and $300 a year thereafter through FY 2002. The FY 98 increase would make over 3.6 million students eligible to receive an increase of up to $600 and make an additional 215,000 families newly eligible for Pell grants. The value of Pell grants has substantially decreased in recent years as appropriation levels have lagged behind increases in college costs and authorization levels. Ten years ago, Pell grants covered an average of 55 percent of a student's college costs at a public university. Today, it covers less than 40 percent. The bill will greatly enhance access and affordability to millions of low income students pursuing higher education. Eliminates Student Fees. Student origination fees are reduced from 3 percent to 2 percent on July 1, 1998; to 1 percent in 2000; to zero after January 1, 2002. The current 1 percent insurance premium is eliminated on July 1, 1998. These savings will provide significant benefits to all students, and will provide additional funds to borrowers up front, at the time the loan funds are needed to pay for the cost of attendance. Provides Loan Forgiveness for New Teachers. The bill allows new teachers in Title 1 school with a high concentration of poor students (30 percent) to have their Direct or FFEL loans forgiven. Eligible teachers would have 15 percent of their loans forgiven in the first and second years of teaching; 20 percent in the third and fourth year; and 30 percent in the fifth year. The amount of the loan forgiveness is not considered ``income'' for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Helps Older, Independent Students and Dependent Students. The bill proposes substantial improvements in the way financial need is established for disadvantaged independent students who do not have dependents other than a spouse. The bill increases the living offset (the amount of income allotted for the student's living expenses) for single students (and married students if both are enrolled in college) from $3,000 to $6,000, and $9,000 for married students where one is enrolled. The allowance is adjusted for inflation in future years. The bill also increases the dependent student earning allowance from the current level of $1,750 to $4,200. The current earning allowance is too low and is a disincentive to student employment. The change helps a category of low income students who were adversely affected by the 1992 higher education reauthorization. Protects Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The bill extends the date (to October 1, 2002) that HBCU's with high default rates are exempted from disqualification in student loan programs. Without the exception, the Department's default prevention policies will have an adverse effect upon 4 year colleges and universities which serve large percentages of minority students. Reduces Interest Rates for Unsubsidized Loans. The bill reduces the applicable interest rate on all subsidized and unsubsidized FFEL and Direct Loans during in-school, grace, and deferment periods to the same rate as the Department of Education's own borrowing rate, although the interest rates would be capped at the same levels as current law. The change will reduce Federal costs by reducing excess profits to lenders during times when there are few servicing costs associated with subsidized loans, but the highest profit margins. Guaranty Agencies and Lenders. The bill proposes a number of changes to the FFEL guaranty agency system in recognition that these State and private nonprofit entities are not the ultimate guarantors of FFEL and act only as administrative agents of the Federal government. Because the Federal government is the sole insurer of FFEL loans, the Secretary would undertake the obligation to pay lenders directly using his agents and recall guaranty agency reserves over the next five years, saving some $2.5 billion. To address structural deficiencies that hamper default prevention activities, guaranty agencies would be authorized to retain no more than 18.5 percent of default collections-- comparable to the Department's cost of collections. To further encourage default prevention, lender risk-sharing would be increased from 2 percent to 5 percent. Direct Lending and FFEL Loan Provisions. The bill allows FFEL borrowers to have the same extended and graduated repayment options currently available only to Direct Loan borrowers. The bill also makes a number of changes that make FFEL consolidation loans more comparable to Direct consolidation loans, thus reducing cost for, and providing greater flexibility to, FFEL borrowers.,2015-03-16 18:11:36.867431,2015-03-16 18:11:36.867431,Extensions,INTRODUCTION OF TWO MAJOR EDUCATION BILLS,1997-04-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-04-24/html/CREC-1997-04-24-pt1-PgE755-2.htm,50,0,143,E755-E757,C000488,mr. clay
506,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in honoring the 10th anniversary of Missouri River Relief and their dedication to preserving Missouri rivers.As a lifelong Missourian, I have visited and enjoyed the natural beauty and recreational opportunities along the Missouri River. These riverbanks and waterways are treasured attractions throughout Missouri. The Missouri River enjoys over 1 million visitors from across the Nation each year who have the opportunity to experience the splendor and excitement these natural resources provide for our state. That is why I am so thrilled to acknowledge the work of the Missouri River Relief program.Founded in 2001, Missouri River Relief began with just a few Missouri River enthusiasts dedicated to cleaning up our State waters. Ten years later, 12,000 Missourians have joined their communities in fighting for this cause, removing over 1 million pounds of trash and debris, making our waters safer for all to enjoy. In 2010 alone, over 1,100 student and teacher volunteers helped clean over 70 miles of river.Missouri River Relief has contributed to promoting river education throughout the State. By sponsoring recreational activities and festivals that incorporate the arts alongside river education, this organization has made it their mission to teach Missouri families about our local rivers and how the rivers contribute to our environment.This project has received an outpouring of State and corporate sponsorships that have made this growing cause a reality. Neighboring States have also included their support, cleaning up almost 400 miles of the Missouri River. The trash gathered from these clean ups have included recyclable and environmental friendly particles that have been turned into useful resources.Working to preserve one of our country's most affluent and beautiful rivers, this organization deserves our gratitude and commemoration. Missouri River Relief is committed to water safety and education and its service to the community stands as an inspiration to all Missourians and a strong signal of our State's continued growth and success.Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the 10th anniversary of the Missouri River Relief. ,2015-03-16 18:11:36.992527,2015-03-16 18:11:36.992527,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2011-02-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-02-03/html/CREC-2011-02-03-pt1-PgS541.htm,16,0,157,S541,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
507,MO,Todd,Akin,R,You know, it was interesting to me that there was a country--it was the U.S.--and they had a theory. Their theory was that the government should provide you with a job, with an education. They should provide you with health care. They should provide you with food and with clothing and with a place to live. That was the job of the government to do those things. We watched that country. It was a big country. After a while, it collapsed. It wasn't just the U.S.--It was the USSR.Aside from the fact that they just hated people of the Christian faith, aside from that sort of prejudice, that was their operating philosophy--that the government was going to provide things that were necessary for your survival. You've got to have food to survive, so the government is going to give it to you. You've got to have health care, so the government is going to give it to you. You have to have education, so the government is going to give it to you. That was their operating premise. We sat there, as I was a young man, and we went ``yuk, yuk, yuk'' when the whole thing fell apart, because we knew it was a dumb idea.So what are we doing in America here under the Pelosi and Obama leadership? The government is not only providing education and housing, but now they're going to jump into expanding to take over all of health care, and they are going to tell you where to work.I guess my question is: How come we are doing the same thing we knew that wouldn't work before? I think that's what a lot of American citizens are saying. Time out. What is going on? We need not just to get the budget in control. We need to deconstruct Washington, D.C., and we need to remove them as a threat to the freedom of this country.,2015-03-16 18:11:37.115615,2015-03-16 18:11:37.115615,House,HEALTH CARE,2010-02-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-24/html/CREC-2010-02-24-pt1-PgH823.htm,24,39,156,H823-H831,A000358,mr. akin
508,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I stand today on behalf of my constituents and with my friend and colleague Congressman John Shimkus to raise further concern about the pending sale and format change of Classic99. As St. Louis's only classical radio station, Classic99 is a true asset to our city.As Congressman Shimkus noted, the sale of KFUO 99.1 FM by the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod is currently under review by both the Media Bureau and the FCC. While we certainly do not wish to exact undue influence on either of these agencies, our constituents have made clear to us their concerns, and we agree that this loss will be a blow to the wealth of our region's culture and economy. We hope that these negative impacts will be considered while reviewing this sale.We have seen that losing the arts can wreak havoc on a community, and the Metro East region will be no different. If Classic99 is converted to a different music format, the cultural and economic consequences will be dismal. The world-renowned St. Louis Symphony Orchestra will lose airtime and its chief advertising venue, forcing gifted musicians and staff to suffer even more pay cuts and freezes. Losing Classic99 will result in a cultural deficit as well. 94% of readers polled by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch feel that the loss of Classic99 ``takes away a vital voice for the arts in this community,'' and will detrimentally affect their ability to support local artists.Arts education organizations throughout my district, like the Opera Theater of St. Louis, the St. Louis Art Museum, and the Touhill Performing Arts Center, will lose their only major arena for audience-building, live broadcasts, and fund-raising. The loss of revenue will hinder arts and music education in the district, further impairing opportunities for our young people to be enriched through the arts. We know that arts education gives youths self-confidence and increases academic achievement. We simply cannot afford to sacrifice these opportunities, and I am deeply troubled by the idea that more educational outlets for our children will be put in jeopardy by this move.I firmly agree with my colleague that the negative impact these cultural and economic changes will have on the local community should play a role in determining the sale of 99.1. ,2015-03-16 18:11:37.231690,2015-03-16 18:11:37.231690,Extensions,IN SUPPORT OF KFUO 99.1 FM ``CLASSIC99'',2010-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-02-25/html/CREC-2010-02-25-pt1-PgE247-4.htm,25,0,156,E247-E248,C001049,mr. clay
509,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Madam Speaker, today, along with my good friend Congressman Jim McGovern, I introduced a resolution of support for the goals and ideals of Global Child Nutrition Month. The fact that hunger and malnutrition is experienced by any person is a sad reflection on our society. However, it is even more troubling to know that roughly 300,000,000 children are experiencing hunger around the world. There is no greater investment in our security and global economic development then ensuring hungry children have access to nutritious food. A hungry child, suffering from malnutrition, will not reach their full physical or mental potential. A hungry child rarely attends school, leaving another, larger generation of hungry and uneducated men to be recruited into radical militant groups and uneducated women to be oppressed. We have the tools today to fight hunger and malnutrition in the world's youngest and most vulnerable. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program has proven to be a very effective tool for providing hungry children nutritious food. The program has the added benefit of encouraging parents to send their children to school, and not to rely on them for income or food. I also believe the political will to make the fight successful is increasing. Although we have a long way to go, President Obama's Administration is making visible efforts to add resources to fighting global hunger. Two examples include the increased budget for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program and the leadership being displayed by the Administration's Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative. Internationally the attention to global food security has rarely been more focused; and hopefully, the resources will soon follow the pledges. This April, many of our non-governmental organization partners will recognize Global Child Nutrition Month and the hunger facing children around the globe. I would like to particularly thank the Global Child Nutrition Foundation and School Nutrition Association for their work in increasing awareness of the problem global hunger presents and for raising funds to help feed hungry children. These two organizations partner with school nutrition professionals around the country and encourage them to take a day, week or even longer to work with students and teachers educating them and raising donations. It is grassroots education and fundraising at its best. Ensuring every child around the world has access to sufficient nutrition is a challenge that will not be easily met, but it will be met. With dedicated partners both in and out of government, we will achieve this goal quicker, which is why I am happy to introduce this resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Global Child Nutrition Month.,2015-03-16 18:11:37.375798,2015-03-16 18:11:37.375798,Extensions,SUPPORT THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF GLOBAL CHILD NUTRITION MONTH,2010-03-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-03-19/html/CREC-2010-03-19-pt1-PgE417-5.htm,41,0,156,E417,E000172,mrs. emerson
510,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, from April 24-26, 2010 more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington, D.C. to take part in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals. We the People is the most extensive educational program in the country that educates young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education under the Education for Democracy Act approved by the United States Congress.I am proud to announce that a class from Westminster Christian Academy represented the state of Missouri at this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and captured ninth place at the national level.While in Washington, the students participated in a three-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which students demonstrate their knowledge and skills as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on historical and contemporary constitutional issues. Annual surveys consistently show that high school students who take part in the We the People academic competition outperform national samples of high school students participating in the National Assessment of Educational Progress political test by at least 22 percent.Madam Speaker, the names of these outstanding students from Westminster Christian Academy are:Molly Anderson, Nick Arnold, Olivia Atkinson, Cheyenne Bartlett, Daniel Chae, Jacob Dahl, Kevin Goldfarb, Jake Grimes, Grace Johnson, Sarah Johnson, Alex Lindstrom, Jimmy Myers, Andrew Nichols, David Rasche, Matt Schwartz, Michael Scott, Ashley Segrave, Emily Sherman, and Curtis Stump.I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Ken Boesch, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the National Finals. Also worthy of special recognition are Millie Aulbur, the state coordinator, and Sandra Diamond, the district coordinator who are responsible for implementing the We the People program in my district.I congratulate these young ``constitutional experts'' on their outstanding achievement at the We the People national finals.,2015-03-16 18:11:37.504885,2015-03-16 18:11:37.504885,Extensions,HONORING WESTMINSTER CHRISTIAN ACADEMY 2010 WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALS,2010-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-05-20/html/CREC-2010-05-20-pt1-PgE896-3.htm,77,0,156,E896,C001049,mr. clay

512,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I would like to jump in a little bit about this whole idea about our trust for different bureaucracies.Let us take a look at the track record. We're talking about a health care system that's going to have the good heart of the IRS and the efficiency of the postal system. Let us take a look at some of these different government agencies and how much--do we really want to trust them with our personal health care? Let's think a little bit about the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy was chartered with a mission. The mission was that we were going to make sure that we're not dependent on foreign sources of energy.Now, we have had a lot of employees and we're more dependent on foreign energy than we've ever been. So how good is the Department of Energy?Let's talk about the Department of Education. There was a Presidential commission studying the Department of Education. They came to the conclusion that if a foreign country had done to us what the Department of Education has done, we would consider it an act of war. But we have a lot of faith in government bureaucracies.Let's talk about your favorite bureaucracy. I shouldn't pick on your pet, the CIA. We go into gulf war 1 and they give us this intelligence. They say, Look, Iraq is 10 years away from making a nuclear device. We get in there; they're a year-and-a-half away. So they go to gulf war II. They say they're a year-and-a-half away. We get in there, they're 10 years away. I mean, why do we have so much faith in all of these?I guess FEMA did a wonderful job on Hurricane Katrina, and yet we want to turn our personal health care over to all of these government agencies? I don't get it. It doesn't seem to make any sense at all.,2015-03-16 18:11:37.789087,2015-03-16 18:11:37.789087,House,NATIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN,2009-07-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-07-22/html/CREC-2009-07-22-pt1-PgH8576.htm,111,89,155,H8576-H8584,A000358,mr. akin
513,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, let me take this moment to recognize the Lafayette-Lexington Daughters of the American Revolution Chapter for creating the Susan Skelton Memorial Scholarship. The scholarship was created in memory of my late wife Susan Anding Skelton, honoring her dedication to higher education and Lafayette County.Susie, a native Missourian, graduated with a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Missouri, Columbia in 1958. In 1976, she served as the first president of the 95th Congress group, the organization representing spouses of new Members of Congress. Susie also played a prominent role in the Congressional Club, serving as treasurer for 2 years and then as president. She was only the second Missourian to serve in that position. As president, she presided over one of the largest memberships in the history of the organization. Additionally, she was president and vice president of International Club III, an organization for spouses of Members of Congress and Ambassadors and was a member of the Congressional Families for Drug-Free Youth.In Missouri, Susie served two consecutive terms as Regent of the Lafayette-Lexington Chapter D.A.R. She also served 4 years on the Democratic State Committee during the 1970s. In Lexington, she taught Sunday school, was a Cub Scout den mother, and a local first grade teacher. Susie was also active in Missouri University Alumni Association events in Lafayette County.Our family friend, LaVeda Cross, was aware of Susie's great involvement in both Washington, DC, and Missouri. As a result, LaVeda and the Lafayette-Lexington D.A.R. Chapter have offered a collegiate scholarship to those individuals that embody the values of Susie. I appreciate the D.A.R. chapter for recognizing the achievements and contributions of Susie. The scholarship is open to any female student who is a permanent resident of Lafayette County and a graduate of one of the following schools: Concordia R-H, Lafayette County C-1, Lexington R-V, St. Paul's Lutheran, or Wellington-Napoleon R-IX and plans to attend college after graduation.Madam Speaker, Susie was influential in Lafayette County and Washington, DC. I am honored that the D.A.R. has created this scholarship in her name. I know the Members of the House will join me in recognizing the Lafayette-Lexington D.A.R.

514,MO,Todd,Akin,R,The thing that scares me to death is my first experience as a State legislator was trying to get a left-turn signal put into a traffic light. Now, there was a lane marked in the pavement. They had a left arrow, but they didn't have a light that had a left arrow. That took me about 4 years and probably over 150 phone calls to the highway department to get them to put that little lens in there with a light that says left turn.I am thinking, if I have trouble with that, how in the world are we going to make something like this work. This is just bizarre. Then I start to think who in the world would have the faith to want to put this system together. Let's take a look at how well our current different departments are doing.You have the post office department known for its efficiency.Then you have an energy department. It was created with the purpose of making sure that we weren't dependent on foreign oil. Oh, that is helpful to know that.Then you have the people who took care of Hurricane Katrina and our emergency management services there.Then you have the education department. They set some records, too, because a study was done of the U.S. Education Department and the conclusion was, if a foreign power had done to America what the Department of Education had done, it would be considered an act of war.Then you have the CIA. Now, there is an interesting operation. In Gulf War I they tell us, well, Iraq is probably 10 years away from making a bomb. We get in there, they are 1 year away. Gulf War II they say they are 1 year away from making a bomb. We get in there and they are not doing it at all.So we have all of these agencies with a great track record, and now we are saying, yeah, so let's turn our health over to the Federal Government. I mean, this takes a lot more faith.I would yield to my good friend, Congresswoman Foxx.,2015-03-16 18:11:38.076319,2015-03-16 18:11:38.076319,House,HEALTH CARE,2009-10-07,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-10-07/html/CREC-2009-10-07-pt1-PgH11085-5.htm,144,15,155,H11085-H11092,A000358,mr. akin

516,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Doak of Stover, MO.Richard L. Doak was born on December 24, 1922, and was the second of seven children to the late Grace and Edgar Doak. Upon completion of high school, Richard became a student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. His college education was interrupted to volunteer for service in the United States Army in World War II. On August 19, 1944, he married Virginia Ray McClesky and soon after completed his undergraduate education, receiving a B.S. in Agriculture. He again served his country as an infantry platoon leader, 7th Division, 31st (Polar Bear) Regiment, Charlie Company, during the Korean War. In honor of his commitment to the U.S. Army, he was awarded both the Silver Star for gallantry in combat and the Bronze Star for meritorious service. After his service, the Doaks returned to Missouri where they would raise their four children on the family farm. Mr. Doak later earned a master's degree in Education from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and served as a teacher at Payne School and as an elementary school principal at Hallsville, Jefferson City, and Versailles, MO. In 1985, Richard retired from teaching and returned to work on his farm raising and showing Southdown sheep.Virginia Ray (McClesky) Doak was born on December 8, 1922, in King, Texas, to Estelle and Henry McClesky. Virginia graduated from high school in Gatesville and attended the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. After receiving her degree, Virginia taught school at Purmela and Plainview in Texas and Payne School in Missouri. On August 19, 1944, she married Richard Doak, a Missourian she had met while he was stationed at Fort Hood. While raising a family in Missouri, Virginia remained close to her family in Texas and looked forward to visiting them at Christmas and during the summer.Madam Speaker, Richard and Virginia Doak were great friends of mine and were valuable members of the Stover community.

517,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chairman, we are speaking about today and not 1983.I have had the opportunity, since being a Member of Congress, to work in the area of professional military education. I must tell you it's important not just for American students, American leaders, American service personnel, but it's important for our friends and allies as well.I have nothing but great respect, great respect for my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts. I know how strongly he feels in his beliefs. But I must say that we are doing the right thing by keeping this school going and going well.We do not teach human rights abuse. This school bestows upon its students standards. It teaches them military art. It teaches them military-to-military relationships. It also instructs in the area of human rights.I have been to Latin America several times. Three weeks ago, I travelled again to the region with Dr. Gingrey and Mr. Conaway, visited Colombia and Panama. There we met with President Uribe of Colombia, President Torrijos of Panama, and other senior military and political leaders. Without exception, the leaders of those countries touted the WHINSEC program in Georgia as an exceptional opportunity for their men and women in uniform to gain not only technical knowledge but a deeper understanding of human rights.Furthermore, spending time in the United States gives them an opportunity to learn of American values, gives them the opportunity to make friends within the American military, with whom they will undoubtedly, in days and years ahead, will have the opportunity to work.I spoke with our American commanders in the field. They reiterated what I have heard many times before. Individuals who have been trained at WHINSEC performed better on their missions in their host country than those who have not.Our military commanders also cherished the relationships that they have built with their Latin American counterparts who participated in the program.In addition to comprehending our military culture and its operations, the school of graduates often are promoted and rapidly rise through the ranks. They understand what it is to have American values, and they understand about human rights which are taught there. The message from everyone was simple: Please keep that school open.Professional military education is so important, but it's also extremely important to allow our neighbors, our friends to the south.

520,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory and tribute to Dr. M. Graham Clark who called the School of the Ozarks his home for the past six decades. Dr. Clark passed away on March 15, at age 92 at his residence on the campus.Dr. Clark led a life dedicated to the glory of God, and committed to the principles of hard work and educational excellence as he worked to expand and lead a free faith-based education to literally thousands of students who have attend the school in the Missouri Ozarks.Dr. Clark arrived at the School of the Ozarks in 1946. Under his leadership the high school was transformed first to a junior college and later into a four year institution of higher learning that is nationally recognized for its emphasis on character development, academic excellence and student work. Those who attend the School of the Ozarks--now named the College of the Ozarks--are offered a unique opportunity. In exchange for a world class college degree, students work for their tuition. They work daily as the college's maintenance, janitorial, secretarial and grounds keeping staff, security guards and food service personnel. This concept, which has won the school an international reputation as ``Hard Work U'', opened the doors of higher education to many who would never have dreamed they could achieve a college degree.Dr. Clark was a tireless campaigner and promoter for the College of the Ozarks in persuading donors to support the school located at Point Lookout, Missouri. His determination and leadership transformed the School of the Ozarks into a national model that has drawn students from all over the world for a classic education steeped in faith, work and service. College of the Ozarks is a unique blend of old fashion respect, daily application of the ``Golden Rule'', and modern technology mixed together with a strong emphasis on the work ethic.The legacy of Dr. M. Graham Clark will touch the lives of many people for generations to come because of the institution he nurtured and guided.

521,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.I want to thank Chairman Combest and Ranking Member Stenholm for working endlessly on the Farm Security Act of 2001. I want them to know that I think they have done a superb job. I think it is an excellent bill. The producers in my district think it is an excellent bill, in spite of what some other people might say. I sincerely appreciate their efforts to include the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the trade title of the farm bill.Missouri's own Harry Truman joined 20,000 Americans on May the 8th, 1946, in sending food donations to victims and survivors of World War II. Many of these recipients were children. And when the packages reached the port at LeHavre, France, it was clear that the folks in the U.S. had joined forces to help those in need, something that Americans have always done at home and abroad.We are fortunate to have overcome the scars of starvation experienced in World War II here in this country, but the battle against hunger and for survival still exists today. We know the school lunch program here in America has made a genuine difference in the lives of hungry children; but, unfortunately, children in other countries are still starving. Three hundred million poor children are undernourished, and 35,000 children die every day from hunger-related disease and illness. A hungry child cannot learn.I am very, very proud of the bill that my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), and I introduced, the George McGovern and Bob Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Act of 2001, which is loosely based on our American School Lunch Program, which was originally sponsored in the United States Senate by Senator Dole and Senator McGovern, who are known worldwide for being champions of ending hunger.Now, the Food for Education Act would make permanent a pilot program for commodity donations that was established during the 106th Congress. This is truly a win-win endeavor for the United States. Not only are we able to feed children here at home and in poor countries, but we also use surpluses from our farmers and producers, and that helps strengthen their bottom lines at a time when our farmers are truly hurting.Additionally, it strengthens farm prices, and we all know that aid does lead to trade.So I just want to thank the chairman and the ranking member once again for including this very, very important piece of legislation within the bill.,2015-03-16 18:11:39.084013,2015-03-16 18:11:39.084013,House,FARM SECURITY ACT OF 2001,2001-10-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-10-04/html/CREC-2001-10-04-pt1-PgH6266-2.htm,132,19,147,H6266-H6342,E000172,mrs. emerson
522,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Republican Majority's socially and fiscally irresponsible budget resolution for fiscal year 2001. I strongly support the Democratic substitute, and urge Members to do the same.This bill is socially irresponsible because it cuts non-defense discretionary spending $114 billion below inflation over the next five years. It does so in order to fund a fiscally irresponsible tax cut that could balloon to as much as $200 billion in five years, and over $1 trillion in ten years. This bill hurts the most needy Americans whom the Republican Party has traditionally ignored. It benefits the most wealthy, as well as the Republicans' special interest friends.Let's take a close look.Under the Majority's bill funding for critical education, training, employment, and social service programs is either frozen or cut, producing significant reductions in current service levels. Only special education is spared the sledgehammer. For example, by fiscal year 2005, 40,000 fewer children would be able to participate in Head Start; and 164,000 fewer low-income families would be able to receive LIHEAP assistance. In just one year, 316,000 fewer low-income students would be able to receive Pell Grants; and 310,000 fewer low-income women, infants, and children would be able to participate in the WIC program.The bill would also slash Title I funding, forcing school districts to provide services to a smaller number of low-income students. The Clinton/Clay class size reduction initiative would be cut, leaving school districts with fewer resources to hire and train new teachers. After-school and summer programs established to help improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime would be cut back, undermining vital school reform efforts.Clearly, this budget abandons those most in need of Federal support. It also fails to address important national priorities such as securing Social Security and Medicare, and paying down the debt. None of this is necessary. The Democratic substitute shows why. Our substitute cuts taxes, but does so in a manner that targets the benefits to working families. Our substitute provides sufficient resources to invest in education and develop our communities. Our substitute would make Social Security and Medicare strong and solvent, while reducing the debt and preserving the hard-won budget surplus.Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I urge the rejection of the Republican Majority's budget resolution, and urge the adoption of the Democratic substitute.,2015-03-16 18:11:39.229117,2015-03-16 18:11:39.229117,House,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-23/html/CREC-2000-03-23-pt1-PgH1291-2.htm,34,207,146,H1291-H1326,C000488,mr. clay
523,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, this conference report is essentially the same document as the resolution Republicans had on the floor last month. The Republican budget plan, if implemented, would threaten our record prosperity and undermine the values of middle-class families. This budget reflects the irresistible urge Republicans have to enact massive, irresponsible tax cuts above all other needs and priorities of the American people.They give tax cuts a higher priority than extending the life of Social Security and Medicare, they are willing to sacrifice a real Medicare prescription drug plan for all seniors, and they are willing to make deep cuts in health and education in order to make their budget add up.There is not one dime in this budget for Social Security and Medicare. Republicans' unwillingness to do anything to prevent the long-term insolvency of these programs that serve as the bedrock of retirement security for millions of Americans is inexplicable.This budget pretends that it pays for a prescription drug plan. But, if you look closer, you will see there is not one penny appropriated for a drug plan. The money is ``reserved.'' It is a budget gimmick. It is not real. It will not happen. Talk is cheap; prescription drugs are not. This budget does not solve the problem.This budget contains Draconian cuts in non-defense appropriations. Nearly $120 billion in cuts need to be made, and, if Republicans have their way, they will cut deep into important priorities like education, health, veterans' affairs, and the environment.It is clear what the American people want. They want a fiscally responsible budget that will keep interest rates low and the economy growing, they want to strengthen Social Security and Medicare so that retirement security is protected for current and future retirees, they want a drug plan in Medicare that covers all seniors who want it, and they want to invest the surplus in their priorities, like making sure that children get the best public education we can provide.Mr. Speaker, this budget did not get better in the conference. It probably got worse. It continues to ignore the voices of working families who have made it perfectly clear that they reject the efforts to bleed the surplus dry for political tax cuts instead of investing in Social Security, in Medicare, in paying down the debt, in ensuring the future of this great country.Vote against this budget. We can do better than this.,2015-03-16 18:11:39.362205,2015-03-16 18:11:39.362205,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 290, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-04-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-04-13/html/CREC-2000-04-13-pt1-PgH2242-5.htm,47,41,146,H2242-H2258,G000132,mr. gephardt
524,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my congratulations to Second Lieutenant Kevin R. White on the occasion of his graduation from Officers Training School. This is a considerable achievement, which I am proud to command to the attention of Congress.Lieutenant White is no stranger to hard work and high achievements. Before graduating from Officers Training School, as an enlisted man he worked toward no less than four different degrees. First he attended and graduated from Georgia Military College in 1989. He then went on to attend the Community College of the Air Force, where he received a degree in Metals Technology in 1991. After that he continued his education by graduating in 1996 from Wayland Baptist University with a B.S. in Occupations Education and graduating from La Verne University in 1999 with a Masters degree in Organizational Management.Throughout his career in the military and in academia, Lieutenant White received a number of awards and honors. He was awarded two Air Force Commendation Medals and one Air Force Achievement Medal. Lieutenant White was named the Third Equipment Maintenance Squadron, Noncommissioned Officer of the Year in 1997 and the Third Equipment Maintenance Squadron Noncommissioned Officer of the 4th quarter in 1997. While fulfilling his military duties, Lieutenant White also excelled in his studies, making the President's list at Wayland Baptist University in 1996.In addition to excelling in the Air Force and working toward a top notch education, Lieutenant White was busy fulfilling many military assignments overseas, such as completing a remote tour of Keflavik, Iceland from 1991 to 1992. Additionally, he spent over 9 years overseas in different countries, including Thailand, Iceland, Singapore, Japan, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant White also found time amidst his many responsibilities to volunteer to be a Big Brother while in Alaska. In fact, he received the Big Brother, Big Sister of the Year Award in 1997. Currently, Lieutenant White takes time out of his busy schedule to coach bowling for participants in the Special Olympics.Lieutenant White has served his community and his country with great distinction. I am honored to pay tribute to his achievements and to recognize his efforts to build a better, stronger America.,2015-03-16 18:11:39.506336,2015-03-16 18:11:39.506336,Extensions,RECOGNIZING SECOND LIEUTENANT KEVIN R.

525,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, if the President were awake at this time of night and watching these proceedings, I am sure that he would say that while he is pleased that this important measure is moving forward, he is also disappointed that we have yet to tackle even more critical priorities in education. This Congress has failed to take action on reducing class sizes. This Congress has failed to take action to address crumbling and overcrowded schools. This Congress has failed to take action on revitalizing our public schools. If this Congress fails to take action on these critical education priorities, we are shortchanging America's schoolchildren. I am sure that would be the response that our President would make.This bill, the William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998, before the House is the product of bipartisan work and an excellent example of what can be accomplished when we join forces to address problems facing our Nation's youth. This important legislation firmly places our child nutrition programs on the path to serve the needs of America's children in the 21st century.H.R. 3874 expands and improves the focus of child nutrition programs in numerous ways. First, it ensures that the Summer Food Service Program will reach more needy children with more nutritious meals. Second, the bill adds provisions to guard against fraud in the WIC program. In addition, it establishes a universal school breakfast pilot project which will examine the close link between education and nutrition.Finally, Mr. Speaker, and most importantly, this legislation enables institutions providing afterschool care to receive reimbursement for meal supplements served to children under the age of 18. This supplement is one more incentive for parents and children to participate in productive, afterschool programs.In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my thanks for the hard work of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and the ranking subcommittee member the gentleman from California (Mr. Martinez) for crafting this legislation. I especially want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) who spearheaded much of the reauthorization on our committee. Her work has been invaluable and many of the bill's provisions are based on legislative proposals that she championed.Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a positive step forward.

526,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, as our Nation's youth head back to school, our attention is obviously focused on education. I would like to focus the national spotlight on one university in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District.Mr. Speaker, I have the distinct honor of representing 16 colleges and universities. Each of these institutions of higher learning in central and northeastern Missouri deserves accolades. Tonight, however, I am happy to single out and congratulate one of those exceptional universities, Truman State, nestled in the heart of Kirksville, MO. Truman State University has received numerous awards in recent college rankings. According to the September 1 issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report, Truman State is the top public university in the entire Midwest. In addition, Mr. Speaker, for the fifth consecutive year, Truman State University is ranked among Money magazine's top 10 best college buys in the country. Frank Lalli, the managing editor for Money magazine says, ``There is always this myth in America that only a name college, only a Harvard, only a Yale provides a great education. It's just not true.''Ranking 8th in the entire Nation, Truman State University consistently reaffirms its reputation as an excellent and affordable liberal arts university. Truman is the only Missouri public institution to make Money's top 100 list. Truman also was ranked as the best value in the Midwest. Money magazine based its selection on graduation rates, social climates, as well as student accessibility to professors. With a student-faculty ratio of 16 to 1, Truman State students can develop close relationships with their professors.I have had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to meet many students and professors who personally validate these recent rankings. John Burns, a Truman State junior, joined my Washington, DC, staff for part of the summer and did exceptional work. But perhaps no one exemplifies the spirit of this great institution better than my good friend, Jack Magruder. As President, Dr. Magruder is a tireless ambassador for Truman State. When looking for someone responsible for Truman State University's ascendance to the top of the Nation's colleges, the buck stops at Jack's door.Mr. Speaker, we in Missouri's Ninth Congressional District are extremely proud that one of our institutions of higher learning is considered among the Nation's elite. The administration, the faculty and the student body at Truman State University deserve kudos for their hard work, their dedication to excellence and their commitment to a superior liberal arts education.,2015-03-16 18:11:39.774500,2015-03-16 18:11:39.774500,House,SPOTLIGHT ON TRUMAN STATE UNIVERSITY,1997-09-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-04/html/CREC-1997-09-04-pt1-PgH6903-3.htm,115,1,143,H6903,H000948,mr. hulshof

529,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to Dr. Ed Elliott, who is retiring from his post as President of Central Missouri State University (CMSU), Warrensburg, MO, after serving there for nearly fourteen years.During Dr. Elliott's tenure at CMSU, the University has seen tremendous growth in enrollment due to Ed's insightful university policies. There has been an expansion of the school's international and distance learning programs, increased admissions standards, a new general studies program, an emphasis in strategic planning and collegial governance, and an integration of a new teaching-learning-assessment model known as Continuous Process Improvement. In addition, numerous building renovations and new construction projects, including the James C. Kirkpatrick Library that will be dedicated in March, have added to student interest in CMSU.Under Ed's leadership, the University has received dramatically increased state and alumni funding. He has also set academic priorities to develop all curriculum around a strong, liberal arts core, verifying quality through assessment and program-specific accreditation. In addition, he integrated technology into the curriculum and emphasized teacher education. Recently, Central has been named the state's lead institution in professional technology.Dr. Elliott became Central Missouri State's 12th president on July 1, 1985, after serving for three years as president of Wayne State College in Wayne, NE. He came to Wayne State in 1971 as director of graduate studies and had also served as a dean and vice president before being named president there.A native of Grain Valley, MO, Ed is a 1960 graduate of William Jewell College and started his teaching career in Harrisonville that same year. He earned his master's degree from Columbia University in 1964, and his doctor of education degree from the University of Northern Colorado in 1969.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Ed Elliott has had an outstanding career in education, and he will surely be missed by everyone at Central Missouri State University.

530,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the welfare-to-work provisions only that are included in H.R. 3073, the Fathers Count Act. These provisions broaden the eligibility requirements for the program so that tens of thousands of low-income families will receive job search and training assistance to improve their ability to secure gainful employment.The welfare-to-work program was enacted as part of the 1997 budget agreement to help families transition from welfare to work by providing them meaningful education and job training assistance. Forty-seven States currently participate in the program and 76,000 recipients have received services.This bill contains a number of improvements necessary to ensure the program's future success. Most notably, Mr. Chairman, the bill expands current eligibility requirements which are so narrow in current law that many deserving welfare recipients cannot qualify. Both the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Ways and Means reported bills that would ease the rules so that more individuals can be assisted.Mr. Chairman, there are others issues that were not solved in committee. The substitute, in my opinion, should reauthorize the Welfare to Work program in future years. The 2.6 million individuals who remain on welfare is a hard-to-serve population that will require extensive and intensive assistance to successfully move off of welfare. This program will be needed for many more years to come.Also, H.R. 3073 only covers six months of education and job training assistance. This is far too short. I regret also that the Committee on Rules did not make in order the amendment of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) to extend training to one year. I support amendments to be offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) which would change the fatherhood program to the parenthood program. I share her concern that both parents need support and should be treated equally.Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments and to support the welfare-to-work operations of the bill.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. ,2015-03-16 18:11:40.351920,2015-03-16 18:11:40.351920,House,FATHERS COUNT ACT OF 1999,1999-11-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-10/html/CREC-1999-11-10-pt1-PgH11870-3.htm,158,25,145,H11870-H11901,C000488,mr. clay
531,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American--a nationally acclaimed civil rights attorney, public education advocate and a true champion of social justice . . . my dear friend and constituent, Frankie Muse Freeman.Frankie Freeman has been a practicing attorney in state and federal courts for more than 60 years. After graduating Hampton Institute and Howard University Law School, she began her career serving the state of Missouri and the City of St. Louis. During this time she helped the NAACP in the case of Brewton v. St. Louis Board of Education, and later represented the NAACP in the landmark case, Davis v. the St. Louis Housing Authority, which ended racial discrimination in public housing.In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Frankie Freeman as the first female member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.From 1967-1971, Frankie Muse Freeman served with distinction as the 14th National President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. During this turbulent time period, she used her talents and skills as an attorney to enhance the Sorority's efforts to gain full civil rights for African-Americans. She spoke out often and effectively for social action and ensured that the Sorority continued to lead efforts to secure human rights for all people. She also used her tenure as National President to lead the Sorority in supporting the college education of a record breaking number of African-American students.Last July, Ms. Freeman became the 96th recipient of the coveted Spingarn Medal, the highest honor bestowed on a citizen by the NAACP. In the official announcement issued by the NAACP Board of Directors Chairman Roslyn M. Brock, she noted, ``Frankie Muse Freeman has dedicated her life's work to the civil rights movement. She broke down barriers as a member of the NAACP's brain trust during the 1950s and as the first woman to serve on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Her determination to end racial discrimination in American society for more than half a century serves as an inspiration to us all.''Mr. Speaker, Frankie Freeman has been a personal mentor of mine for almost 30 years. Her inspired advocacy laid the groundwork for the Federal Voting Rights Act, ended racial discrimination in public housing, and provided dedicated oversight of the St. Louis Public Schools and the voluntary desegregation plan.

532,MO,Sam,Graves,R,Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Dr. Dennis Fisher on his retirement as the Superintendent of the Park Hill School District in Kansas City, Missouri.Dr. Fisher started his career in education as a Junior High Social Studies teacher in Papillion, Nebraska. He also served as the interim Superintendent and the Assistant Superintendent for Business Services at the Liberty School District in Liberty, Missouri. He began his time at Park Hill in 1999 as the Assistant Superintendent for Business Services before becoming Superintendent in 2005. Dr. Fisher has a total of 36 years of experience in education.Under Dr. Fisher's leadership, the Park Hill School District has achieved many awards. They became the first school district ever to receive the Missouri Quality Award and continues to receive the Distinction in Performance Award from the State of Missouri each year. Park Hill is one of the highest-achieving districts in the state, but Dr. Fisher has still pushed for continuous improvement through the years.Dr. Fisher has received many acclamations personally also. In 2011, he was named the Missouri Superintendent of the Year and received the Pierce Award, the Missouri Association of School Administrators' highest honor. In 2005, Dr. Fisher received the Missouri School Business Official of the Year award.He leads not only 10,292 students, 1,400 staff members, and an annual operating budget of $120 million, but also many organizations of his peers. He has served as President of the Missouri Association of School Business Officials, the Kansas City Association of School Business Officials, and the Greater Kansas City Administrators Association. He is also very dedicated to helping the community and has served on the Board of Directors for the Missouri Securities Investment Program, Synergy Services Inc, the Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Platte County Economic Development Council, and the Parkville Economic Development Council.I have had the honor of working with Dr. Fisher over the last few years and have seen first hand his dedication to the education and development of students in the Park Hill School District. His commitment to the students, staff, and community is all-encompassing.Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in congratulating Dr. Fisher on his retirement and in wishing him the best of luck in the years to come.,2015-03-16 18:11:40.785217,2015-03-16 18:11:40.785217,Extensions,HONORING DR.

533,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Today, I and Senator Jim Talent introduce the Easement Owners Fair Compensation Act of 2006. This bill will right a wrong done to property owners from whom the government took property without compensation. It will also ensure that future property owners are treated fairly when the government seeks to take their property through eminent domain.In 1992, the federal government confiscated property owned by 102 St. Louis County, Missouri residents through the Federal Rails to Trails Act. The taking imposed an easement on their property for a public recreational hiking/biking trail. A trail easement was established on their property on December 20, 1992. After twelve years of bureaucratic fighting and delay, the Justice Department admitted the government's takings liability and agreed to pay the property owners $2,385,000.85 for their property, interest and legal fees.However, two days before the U.S. Court of Claims was scheduled to approve the compensation agreement, the U.S. Federal Circuit issued the Caldwell decision regarding a rails-to-trails takings case in Georgia. That decision established the statute of limitations for rails-to-trails claims as the date of notice of interim trail use, not the date the trail easement was imposed on the property, as previously assumed. Under the new date, the statute of limitations on the St. Louis County takings claim had expired. The Justice Department accordingly sought dismissal of the claims without payment and the Court of Claims judge agreed.This bill is a Senate companion to H.R. 4581 introduced by Representative Akin and cosponsored by Representatives Carnahan and Emerson. The legislation sets the statute of limitations as beginning on the date an interest is conveyed. It also allows for reconsideration of past claims dismissed because of this issue. By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Coleman):S. 3480. A bill to prevent abuse of Government credit cards; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Government Credit Card Abuse Prevention Act to address, in a comprehensive way, the abuse, misuse, and fraud that has occurred with Government charge cards. Some people might ask, ``Why are you bothering with legislation? Is it that big of a problem?'' It is true that most Government employees who are entrusted with a travel card or a purchase card do not abuse it. It may also be true that the amount of money concerned is only a fraction of any agency's annual budget. Well, when you have agencies like the Department of Defense with an over $500 billion budget, even a small fraction means a lot of taxpayers' money. When I asked GAO to look into instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with Government charge cards, starting with the Department of Defense, we found that purchase cards were used to spend taxpayer money for a sapphire ring, LA-Z-Boy reclining rocking chairs, and a dinner party for a general at Treasure Island Hotel and Casino that included $800 for alcohol. Government travel cards were used for gambling, sporting events, concerts, cruises, and even gentlemen's clubs and legalized brothels. Government travel cards are for official travel-related expenses only, not tickets to a Dallas Cowboys game or a Janet Jackson concert, but these are real examples of improper purchases GAO uncovered in reports I had requested. While travel cards are not paid directly with taxpayers' money like purchase cards, failure by employees to repay these cards results in the loss of millions of dollars in rebates to the Federal Government. Also, when credit card companies are forced to charge off bad debt, they raise interest rates and fees on everyone else.Based on what we found in DoD, I worked with GAO to uncover similar problems in the U.S. Forest Service where one employee purchased five digital cameras at a cost of $2,960, six computers for $6,019, three palm pilots totaling $736, jewelry worth $1,967, and $6,101 in other items like cordless telephones, figurines, and Sony Playstations, all for personal use and all at taxpayer expense. GAO subsequently found similar problems at other agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Housing an Urban Development. I have cited just some of the extreme examples, but there are many more instances where employees purchased items that were not needed by the agency or where a cheaper alternative would meet the purpose just as well. This occurred because of weak internal controls within the agencies and is something that clearly needs to be addressed governmentwide. Based on oversight from Congress, GAO, and agency inspectors general, the situation has improved in many agencies and I am pleased that the Office of Management and Budget has begun to bring about an improved control environment through direction contained in OMB Circular 123. However, there is more to be done and my experience has convinced me that legislation is necessary.The Government Credit Card Abuse Prevention Act is largely based on the recommendations by GAO regarding what controls are necessary to prevent the kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse we have uncovered. Since I originally introduced this legislation in the last Congress, I have collected input and ideas and worked to refine the bill to make it both comprehensive and workable. The provisions in my bill are simply commonsense internal controls that should be present in every Federal agency to prevent improper purchases. These include: performing credit checks for travel cardholders and issuing restricted cards for those with poor or no credit to reduce the potential for misuse; maintaining a record of each cardholder, including single transaction limits and total credit limits so agencies can effectively manage their cardholders; implementing periodic reviews to determine if cardholders have a need for a card; properly recording rebates to the Government based on prompt payment; providing training for cardholders and managers; utilizing available technologies to prevent or catch fraudulent purchases; establishing specific policies about the number of cards to be issued, the credit limits for certain categories of cardholders, and categories of employees eligible to be issued cards; invalidating cards when employees leave the agency or transfer; establishing an approving official other than the purchase cardholder so employees cannot approve their own purchases; reconciling purchase card charges on the bill with receipts and supporting documentation; submitting disputed purchase card charges to the bank according to the proper procedure; making purchase card payments promptly to avoid interest penalties; retaining records of purchase card transactions in accordance with standard Government recordkeeping polices; utilizing mandatory split disbursements when reimbursing employees for travel card purchases to ensure that travel card bills get paid; comparing items submitted on travel vouchers with items already paid for with centrally billed accounts to avoid reimbursing employees for items already paid for by the agency; and submitting refund requests for unused airline tickets so the taxpayers don't pay for tickets that were not used.My bill would also provide that each agency inspector general will periodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase card and travel card programs and perform periodic audits to identify potential fraudulent, improper, and abusive use of cards. We have had great success working with inspectors general using techniques like data mining to reveal instances of improper use of government charge cards. Having this information on an ongoing basis will help in strengthening and maintaining a rigorous system of internal controls to prevent future instances of waste, fraud, and abuse with government charge cards. In addition, my bill requires penalties so that employees who abuse Government charge cards cannot get away scotfree. In cases of serious misuse or fraud, the bill provides that employees must be dismissed and suspected cases of fraud will also be referred to the appropriate U.S. attorney for prosecution under Federal antifraud laws. Hopefully this will send a clear message that such activity will not be tolerated so as to act as a deterrent for others. By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):S. 3483. A bill to improve national competitiveness through enhanced education initiatives; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleague from Nevada, Senator Ensign, the ``National Innovation Education Act''. The intent of this bill is to enhance our science and technology talent base and improve national competitiveness through strengthened education initiatives. Enhancing academic success, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math--often called the STEM disciplines--through innovative educational programs will stimulate change and growth within elementary, secondary and postsecondary institutions, improve current educational opportunities for all students, allow graduates greater opportunity for economic success and greater ability to successfully compete in the global market.This bill proposes initiatives spanning the education spectrum that seek to improve quality instruction and access to STEM learning for all students. Recent recommendations from the Council on Competitiveness and The Augustine Commission at the National Academy of Sciences, among others, target national concerns around the content and quality of K-16 in STEM disciplines, particularly with regard to minority and low-income students, the need to stimulate innovation, and the need to enhance teacher preparation and professional development in the STEM fields.An increasing number of researchers express alarm at the nearly one out of three public high school students who won't graduate and the failure of our systems to adequately prepare high school graduates, and particularly minorities, for success in college and the work place. Addressing the challenge of successfully thriving in a world of change, the Council on Competitiveness examined the pressing issue of attracting more young Americans to science and engineering fields. Currently, less than 15 percent of U.S. students have the prerequisite skills to pursue scientific or technical degrees in college. Only 5.5 percent of the 1.1 million high school seniors who took the college entrance exam in 2002 planned to pursue an engineering degree. And there continues to be poor representation of women and minorities in these fields. The National Academies report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' notes that amongst the U.S. science and technology workforce 38 percent of PhDs were foreign born. Changes need to be enacted to not only increase the number of students pursuing math and science degrees but to prepare them to pursue these degrees.Indeed, numerous national reports in recent years have called for efforts to improve K-12 education, teacher preparation and professional development in the STEM areas. Recommendations include increasing the numbers of postsecondary students pursuing careers in the areas of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology and increasing the numbers of postsecondary students in the STEM fields who will then pursue concurrent degrees in education. Increasing funding for not only STEM education but STEM research has received strong recommendations as an important and timely approach to addressing improvements in education and innovation. Finally, a critical factor to ensuring program success is the ability to engage and then hold students' interests in the various STEM fields enough to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Our bill seeks to craft a comprehensive response to many of these issues, and includes the following provisions.Title I--Improving Pre-kindergarten Through Grade 16, supplies a remedy to the critical issue of the disconnect existing between high school outcomes and college expectations. Through the formation of partnerships between P-12 and higher education systems in the states--P-16 Commissions--academic success in postsecondary education becomes the priority agenda item for reform. We anticipate that P-16 Commissions will bring about an increase in the percentage of academically prepared students, particularly low-income and minority students, and a decrease in the percentage of college students requiring remedial coursework, particularly with respect to math, science, and engineering.Many States across our country have already seen the wisdom of a P-16 Commission and have been working on goals and implementation. The results, although preliminary for many States, are vastly encouraging. Title I will provide support both to States with existing P-16 bodies, or States seeking to establish such commissions. It will give priority to the States also seeking to establish or enhance data systems. We hope that States will have an opportunity to craft a vision that will reach all students over time so that their educational pathway of access to and success in college will be ensured.Magnet schools have the capacity to create learning environments tailored to the interests and needs of its community and can offer a focused curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds. Title II of our bill authorizes the National Science Foundation to award grants to assist in the promotion of innovation and competitiveness through the development and implementation of magnet school programs. These programs would encourage students to meet state academic content standards through the development and design of innovative educational methods, practices and curricula that promote student achievement in STEM courses and encourage student enrollment in postsecondary institutions.In addition, Title II authorizes NSF grants to elementary and middle schools creating pilot programs implementing innovation-based experiential learning environments. Innovation-based experiential learning is a teaching model that seeks to seed traditional technical studies with new exposure to methods for creative thinking and translating ideas into practical applications. Such programs would likely involve immersing students in hands-on experimentation that helps students discover new concepts and use those concepts to solve real-world problems.The interrelated demands that mathematics and science education places upon schools to prepare both teachers and students must be addressed consecutively. Teachers need to be better prepared to teach STEM topics across the board and students need to have access to teachers who are well versed in their content subjects.Title III of our bill authorizes funding to increase the number of graduates from postsecondary institutions with concurrent degrees in education and STEM fields. This program is based on the successful UTeach model at the University of Texas at Austin. Encouraging science and math majors to concurrently pursue certification in the field of education will help increase the number and quality of teachers in these fields. The model program at the University of Texas has experienced impressive success in attracting and keeping promising young STEM teachers. Our bill also calls for the establishment of Teacher Professional Development Institutes to promote innovative and effective approaches to improving teacher quality by providing professional development support for educators already in the classroom. The Teacher Institute Model encourages collaboration between urban teachers and university faculty to improve student learning by enhancing teacher mastery of subject matter. It is based upon the model which has been in operation at Yale University in New Haven, CT for over 25 years.Our Nation recognizes the pressing need to increase funding for STEM research and boost the number of students in undergraduate and graduate programs pursuing mathematics and science degrees for our country's continued development, prosperity and security.Within the final title of our bill, Title IV, NSF basic research funding is doubled. NSF is authorized to expand funding for STEM education through increased fellowships and trainee programs at the undergraduate and graduate level. A clearinghouse at the National Science Foundation of successful professional science master's degree program elements will be made available to postsecondary institutions as well as grants for developing pilot programs or improving current programs. In addition the NSF Tech Talent program is reauthorized with increased funding. This program provides competitive grants to undergraduate universities to develop new methods of increasing the number of students receiving degrees in science, math, and engineering. Finally, it is in our interest to examine and understand the emerging field of services sciences, a multidisciplinary curriculum partnering science, technology, engineering, and math with management and business disciplines. To this end, the National Science Foundation will conduct a collaborative study with leaders from institutions of higher education to come to an understanding of how best to support this new field.Our National Innovation Education Act takes a broad and comprehensive approach to addressing national prosperity, security and our ability to compete internationally with recommendations for enhanced education initiatives in order to improve our national competitiveness. Improving current education for all students will allow graduates greater opportunity for economic success and greater ability to successfully compete in the global market. Our very Nation's future prosperity and security depends upon our willingness as leaders to infuse education with the requisite innovative vision that will inspire our youth to reach for goals that are achievable only beyond the ordinary bounds.I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure.

534,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak because I believe the right participation by the U.S. Government in the educational process of our children is fundamental to our success as a nation in the next century. It is important for us to understand that we have a limited role in this area.Mr. President, 93 percent of all the funding for education--93 percent; that is basically $13 out of $14 spent in education--comes from State and local governments. Frankly, I think that is a positive, not a negative. I think when people invest their own resources, when they invest the resources they have control over, they are likely to do so very effectively.But it is appropriate, and as a matter of fact beneficial, when the Federal Government decides to be of assistance in the area of education. When we are involved, I think there ought to be some principles that we should follow in order to make sure we maximize the positive impact we can have in terms of the achievement standing of children. I use a term such as ``achievement standing'' or the ``capacity to achieve'' because I think that is what we are interested in, in education.The question is, What do we want out of education? I think we want children whose capacity to do things, whose capacity to learn, and the things that they have learned, have been enhanced substantially.It is nice to have school buildings. It is nice to have teachers. It is nice to have education programs. But ultimately, the purpose for which we develop resources and to which we devote the resources, is to elevate the capacity of children to learn.How do we improve what happens to children?I have had some opportunity to be aggressive and active in this area at the State and local level in government. Having spent 8 years as the Governor of my State, and visiting many of Missouri's 550 or so school districts, I know it is the focal point of the community in almost every setting. It is the objective of that community to elevate the standing of students, asking how do we help students do more?Different communities have found different ways of inspiring students, preparing students, building students, and elevating what happens in the classroom. I think that is what we should be involved in.During my time as Governor of the State of Missouri, the State board of education was so convinced about getting parents and teachers involved in the education of children, because it motivates children to be achievers, that we had a slogan that said: ``Success in school is homemade.''Talking about localizing what we do in education, if you take it all the way to the home, you have localized it about as much as possible.As a matter of fact, during my time as the president, or chairman--I forget the designation I carried--for the Education Commission of the States, it was an emphasis we agreed upon nationally that energizing parents and energizing the local community was the way in which we get the most return for our school dollars, as study after study has shown. And the anecdotal evidence is incredibly strong that cultures that involve parents and local officials in making decisions for what can and will work are the cultures where education succeeds.So the ingredients of public school success include the very important point of getting students motivated as a result of the active participation of their families.The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question about what are the ingredients of educational success in a report released in July of 1998. The report was called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of Federal funding and directives but instead were characterized by--here are the ingredients--parental involvement in the education of their children; two, local control; three, emphasis on basic academics; four, dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. I believe these are the ingredients that are necessary for all of us to understand if we are going to talk about elevating the performance of students, which is why we speak about this issue today, because there are noble objectives and there are programs that may sound novel and noble, but if they don't elevate the status of students, we will have failed miserably.I am concerned that too often the Federal program which finds its first consumption of resources in the administration of the program and the bureaucracy at the Federal level very frequently then goes to the State bureaucracy at the State level, but it doesn't get all the way to the student.But there is more to my concern that the proposal just doesn't get all the way to the student. Frequently, when it gets all the way to the student, it directs an activity or a devotion of the resource which is not called for in the circumstance of the student.So there are two principles that are operative here: First, that we get the resource all the way to the student so that the resource is spent in the classroom and not in the bureaucracy. The second principle is, let the resource be spent, once it is at the level of the student, on things that make a difference in terms of performance and student achievement in the classroom.It would be appropriate, I think, to have some sense of satisfaction of getting a resource all the way to the classroom and not having the shrinkage of the bureaucracy that takes the resource away. But if the resource gets to the classroom and the expenditure can only be for things that aren't needed or directly pertinent to student achievement, we will have lost the battle anyhow.Yesterday, I had the opportunity of addressing this body, and I had the unhappy task of detailing the fact that for tens of thousands of individuals at the State level in our educational effort their entire existence is consumed with filling out Federal forms; that we are serving the bureaucracy with paperwork perhaps more effectively than we are serving the students with education.If the active participation by parents, community leaders, teachers, and boards of education at the local level is what really energizes schools to elevate the level of student achievement, maybe we should not have so much direction from the Federal level about how much and where the money should be spent.I think that is pretty clear as a part of this bill which has been offered by our side; that we want to get the resources to individuals in the classroom, and not only deliver the resources to the classroom but to make sure that the best use for those resources can be determined by those who know the names of the students and the needs of the school rather than some hypothetical best use being developed a thousand miles away by bureaucrats who know, in theory, that generally the country needs X or Y but do not have very much awareness of specific needs in specific classrooms, in specific districts, in particular towns, counties, or communities all across America.So this principle is, one, to get resources to the classroom and, two, to let the people who know the names of the students and the needs of the schools make the decisions. That is of fundamental importance.When you gather at the Federal level the character of the programs and say we will make all the decisions about what is done, and we may want to get the resources to you but we will tell you what you have to do, that is the equivalent of hanging a sign on the schoolhouse door: ``Parents need not apply.'' It is the equivalent of saying to them, as much as we think you are an important part of education, you won't get to help make a decision about the way the resources are devoted, about the kind of program that is conducted, because, as a matter of fact, we will make those decisions for you in some remote bureaucracy.I think the key to what we want to do is to empower those individuals at the local level by, first, sharing the resources with them as efficiently as possible, not shrinking it by running it through bureaucracy after bureaucracy and, second, empowering them by saying, once you have the resources, you have the right and opportunity to spend it in ways you know will benefit the students in a specific setting.We have watched as we have lived with the sort of status quo in education, with the Federal Government trying to impose its ideas on the country, and we aren't showing the desired results. When you are not getting the right results, if you keep doing the same things, you are asking for difficulty. The industrialist puts it this way: Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting.If we like what we are getting in education, we should just keep doing what we are doing. But if we think we can do better --as a matter of fact, if we think we must do better for the next generation of Americans, if we recognize that the world is exploding in a technological, developmental sense, and that for people to be at the top of the list, they are going to have to be able to deal with technology and they will have to have high levels of achievement and capacity in terms of education, I think we are going to have to confess that we must do better. And in order to do better, we have to change what we are doing.It is virtually impossible to do better if we just do the same thing over and over. I think State and local governments need the kind of flexibility that we provide, and I think when we try to restrict that flexibility, when we try to restrain the capacity of the people who know best what their own children need, who witness what will motivate, on occasion, success in those students, we tell them they can't use that judgment, awareness, and knowledge, they can't use their proximity to the problem as a basis for developing a solution, as a matter of fact, we are hindering the process.I stand to speak in favor of this measure which will not only move resources to the local and State level but will provide the authority and flexibility so those resources can be devoted to students in classrooms in ways that are known by the individuals who know--teachers and students--and to the needs of the institution to improve performance. I believe that is the key.For us to persist in doing what we have done with the status quo, to persist with a system that finds more and more people disenchanted because they find their hands tied, and they want to do one thing they believe will help their students but the government says, no, they have to do something else, which isn't that helpful, or, even in order to do something else, they have to file a stack of papers that will take people out of the classroom, moves people away from education.For the Federal Government, according to a study in Florida, to administer Federal dollars, it is about six times as expensive as it is to administer a State dollar. That is six times the paperwork volume that is basically involved.We ought to begin to wonder whether those individuals who actually have the stake in the circumstances, their child in the school, why we should distrust them and impose this sort of not only rigid set of requirements but this rigid audit trail which requires six times as much administration as a State or local dollar does to deliver educational capacity to children. That is something we ought to be leery of. We ought to say, wait a second. Why would we want to spend all of that money in administration and second-guessing those who know best about their own children, their own future, and who have a stake in this issue, which is the important stake, and that is the achievement of the students?I think we ought to ask ourselves what happens in education when there is more nonteachers in the education system than there is teachers in the education system? When the administration of education and the tens of thousands of full-time equivalents across the country mandated by the Federal Government consume the resources instead of the resources getting to the classroom, we ought to ask ourselves: Is this the way for us to really be achievers?We know when people have the right opportunity to succeed and the right resources, they can get the job done--my colleagues and I have talked about it over and over again--when they have the right opportunity in terms of resources and the right authority in terms of flexibility.I think those are the two keys we have offered to the American people by this measure on our side as a way of allowing them to use the money they have paid in taxes to elevate the capacity of the students who will chart the course of America in the next century.We want for our children high levels of achievement. The children are the focus. The classroom is the focus. It is the place where it happens to those on whom we focus--the children. The ingredients of success are not great bureaucracies. They are great teachers, great classrooms, and great students. And it involves parents. When we tell parents the bureaucracy will make the decisions, we shunt them aside. We tell them they need not apply. That is a dangerous strategy and damaging to our students.Our Federal programs haven't worked, and just doing more of it won't improve our performance.My grandfather's admonition was, ``I sawed this board off more times, and it is still too short.'' If you keep sawing it will still be too short. You have to change your conduct.We should change the focus at the local level; States and local governments need the ability as it relates to teachers. As Senator Abraham said, we are not going to mandate that the States and local communities deal with teachers in any specific way. We want to authorize them to be able--with the resources they earned and paid in taxes--to devote those resources in such a way that they believe it will result in elevated performance for the students.That is the long and the short of what we ought to be doing. The status quo is unacceptable. America will not survive on a continuing basis in the long term with our students being last on the list of those among industrialized nations. It doesn't matter if we are first on the list of expenditures. It doesn't matter if we have more resources devoted to the process that is eventually sucked into the bureaucracy or devoted to things that do not pay off. What matters is that students achieve. We cannot long endure as the leader of the free world if our students are the last on the list. Being the leader and being last doesn't fit.It is time for us to focus our energies, resources, and authority to make good decisions for the elevation of student capacity. That will make a difference at the local level. That is why this measure is such an important measure.I yield the floor.,2015-03-16 18:11:41.073450,2015-03-16 18:11:41.073450,Senate,EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT,2000-05-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-04/html/CREC-2000-05-04-pt1-PgS3453-7.htm,54,52,146,S3453-S3469,A000356,mr. ashcroft

537,MO,Isaac Newton, IV (Ike),SKELTON,Democrat,Mr. Speaker, today, the House is considering H.R. 1105, the Fiscal Year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. This legislation will complete the fiscal year 2009 appropriations process and keep our federal government operating through the end of the fiscal year. Taken as a whole, passing H.R. 1105 is good for our country. It invests in rural priorities, like agricultural and rural development programs, while simultaneously fostering the health, education, and safety of the American people.While I will support H.R. 1105, I am deeply disappointed that the measure includes a provision added by the Senate to authorize a $25 million study to review the original project purposes of the Missouri River as set forth by Congress, by the Missouri River Master Manual, and by the federal courts. In my view, authorizing and appropriating funds for a new Missouri River study is unwarranted.,2015-03-16 18:11:41.525744,2015-03-16 18:11:41.525744,House,OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009,2009-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-02-25/html/CREC-2009-02-25-pt1-PgH2656-2.htm,33,101,155,H2656-H2805,S000465,mr. skelton

H.R. 44 would give appropriate recognition to the extraordinary hardships endured by the people of Guam and the loyalty they demonstrated to the United States of America during 32 months of occupation. The bill would also provide for compensation for the victims and relatives of those who suffered and for research, education, and media efforts to memorialize the occupation.I recently had the opportunity to visit Guam and I was reminded of the strategic importance it plays in preserving the security of our nation.

558,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I am extremely pleased to cosponsor this amendment with my friend and my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). We have sponsored a number of amendments over the last several years to take dollars from the American military assistance to Colombia, and I do not do this action because I am unsympathetic to President Uribe and what he is trying to accomplish. I think he is sincerely working to break the stranglehold that drug cartels and insurgency groups have on his nation. But the message sent by cutting this funding, those messages need to reach the Colombian people, this administration and his administration.It is true, Mr. Chairman, that more is asked of the American soldier that is sent to Colombia than Colombia asks of its own soldiers. This bothers me to no end.The Colombian people need to take concerted and consistent steps to help provide for their long-term security. That means providing for a sustained financial base.Our administration needs to come forward with a long-term strategy for American military involvement in Colombia. Many in this House are worried about the creeping nature of our expanding mission in Colombia, known as mission creep. We need to know what role the American troops will play and for what period of time.Having this knowledge is even more critically important as we face a long-term commitment. Our troops have the possibility of continued work in North Korea, Liberia, not to mention Iraq. We do not have enough troops to go around the world wearing them out.We need to increase our end strength, but we have needed to do that for a while. We also need to look carefully at all of our commitments and the decisions.So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It does not eliminate all funding for Colombia, nor does it touch the critical programs like IMET, which is developing a more professional military in Colombia.I said a moment ago that more is asked of the American soldier that is down there helping them fight the rebels than they ask of their own soldiers. Every soldier in the American Army has at least a high school education or its equivalent or they cannot join. If anyone has a high school education in Colombia, they are exempt from their military conscription. If they come from wealthy families, if they have a high school education, they do not have to serve; but Americans down there to train them and trying to help beat back the rebels are more highly educated and are putting themselves on the line, when they in Colombia do not ask the same as we ask of our soldiers who are there to help them.Mr. Chairman, I resent this. I resent this very much. If they want our continued help, they should prove it by having a conscription law that cuts across all classes and all education. So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It will not injure the programs that are important whatsoever, and it will cause them in Colombia, as well as our administration, to take a good hard look at what is necessary to win in Colombia.,2015-03-16 18:12:44.673658,2015-03-16 18:12:44.673658,House,FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004,2003-07-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-07-23/html/CREC-2003-07-23-pt2-PgH7394.htm,110,9,149,H7394-H7444,S000465,mr. skelton
559,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, education is the great equalizer, and getting a college education remains a part of the American dream. Yet affording that education at an institution of higher learning can be a nightmare for a prospective student or that student's family.According to a 1997 GAO report, since the early 1980s college tuition has increased by 234 percent, which of course far outpaces the cost of living or any rise in family income. Some students balance their class work with part-time jobs, others rely on financial aid packages or scholarships. This body, Mr. Speaker, has attempted in the past to ease the financial burden. Back in 1997 Congress passed and former President Clinton signed into law the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This legislation created the Hope Tax Credit as well as the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit to help families afford the cost of sending a child to college.Since then we have built on our work. We have added to the success of the 1997 bill. We have expanded education savings account. We have made prepaid tuition plans more attractive, and we have expanded the student loan interest deduction.When the merits of the Hope Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit were being considered back in 1997, the potential compliance costs for colleges and universities were raised as a potential drawback. In fact, I recall and probably the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) may recall the particular hearing we had in front of the Committee on Ways and Means and the former Treasury Secretary was appearing before us, and I asked Mr. Rubin about the compliance cost. We had been alerted to some potential substantial administrative burdens that colleges and universities were going to have to undertake, even while implementing this worthwhile legislation. I recall the answer that Mr. Rubin gave; he felt it would be a small, insignificant cost.In fact, I think he said it would be the cost of a pencil and a piece of paper. Well, as C-SPAN was covering that hearing live that day, the phone lines in our congressional office began to light up as school administrators from around the country began to call, again with this concern about this burden, this compliance cost that they would have to undertake if, in fact, we enacted the HOPE scholarship or the HOPE tax credit, as well as the lifetime learning credit and, unfortunately, their premonition has been borne out. It has been clear that our Nation's institutions of higher learning have faced significant increased administrative burdens, which brings us today.The bill before us, H.R. 3346 that has been introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo), accomplishes the goal of reducing administrative burdens on schools, while retaining the integrity of the HOPE and lifetime learning credits. We accomplish this by modifying how tuition amounts are reported and also eliminating an unneeded reporting requirement in current law that colleges and universities provide the Internal Revenue Service with the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of taxpayers who could claim students attending the school as dependents. While these changes may seem minor, I can assure my colleagues that they will greatly reduce the administrative burdens on our colleges and universities. I urge this body to be supportive of H.R. 3346.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:12:44.796746,2015-03-16 18:12:44.796746,House,AMENDING INTERNAL REVENUE CODE TO SIMPLIFY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS,2001-12-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-12-04/html/CREC-2001-12-04-pt1-PgH8801.htm,166,6,147,H8801-H8803,H000948,mr. hulshof
560,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of George Abraham Thampy, of Maryland Heights, Missouri. George correctly spelled ``demarche'' to win the National Spelling Bee held last week in Washington, D.C. The week prior, George placed second in the National Geography Bee, also held in Washington, D.C.I would like to offer my congratulations to this young scholar who has worked diligently to not only reach, but also win, the National Spelling Bee. George's performance has been exemplary and I'm confident it will serve to promote a heightened interest in academic achievement. George also tied for fourth place in 1998 and finished in a third place tie last year.I look forward to the continued success of Missouri home school families such as George's, and hope to continue promoting the kind of freedom that encourages parents to take an active role in guiding the course of their children's education. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. ,2015-03-16 18:12:44.934843,2015-03-16 18:12:44.934843,Senate,IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE ABRAHAM THAMPY,2000-06-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-06-09/html/CREC-2000-06-09-pt1-PgS4922.htm,71,0,146,S4922,A000356,mr. ashcroft
561,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme contained in this bill is nothing more than a back door vehicle for subsidizing families who want to send their children to private elementary and secondary schools. It is designed to create a tax shelter for families of high incomes, while leaving nothing for families that don't even have enough to pay for their retirement.According to the Department of Education, these tax provisions would give an average tax break of $96 for families earning $150,000. However, for poor families, the average benefit would be only $1.Rather than pursuing this shamefully regressive tax scheme, we should strengthen our public schools, where 90 percent of our Nation's children attend. We should address the problems of leaky roofs and overcrowded classrooms. We should target funds for school renewal in our country's poorest school districts. Finally, we should move to reduce class sizes--a proven strategy for enhancing student achievement.,2015-03-16 18:12:45.061933,2015-03-16 18:12:45.061933,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2646, EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1998,1998-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-06-18/html/CREC-1998-06-18-pt1-PgH4727-5.htm,80,49,144,H4727-H4739,C000488,mr. clay

569,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Chairman, this Republican budget reminds me of a movie I saw a few years ago called ``Groundhog Day.'' In the movie, Bill Murray, who is the star, keeps reliving the same day over and over again. Everything happens to him the same way.This budget, which has been advertised as a real change, when you examine it, when you open the package that has been repackaged, is really the same thing. It is said to be a moderate budget. It is not a moderate budget. It is warmed over tax cuts for the wealthy, rehashed cuts in Medicare, in Medicaid, reconstituted cuts in education and the environment.For 17 months, the President, the Democrats have been waiting for the Republicans to come to the sensible center so that we could get a budget done. The Republicans have been offered a balanced budget plan made up entirely of cuts that the Republicans support, but it is never good enough. We cannot seem to get the compromise, the consensus that we need to get this done.This budget still raises taxes.Now listen to this. I said it in the last budget debate:This budget raises taxes on working people who are at the bottom, trying to get in the middle class, while it cuts dramatically taxes on capital gains, most of which goes to the wealthiest Americans. How can anyone argue that this is fair, that this is sensible, that this is pragmatic, that this is what we ought to be doing in this country?It still cuts Medicare and Medicaid way too much. That would not have to be done if we simply gave up the tax break for the wealthiest Americans, if we just focus the tax break on middle-income people and people trying to get in the middle class. We would not need as deep a cut in Medicare and Medicaid and in education.And then if we look at the list that comes out of discretionary spending, it is too long for me to read this afternoon. Job training in vocational education, cut by more than $1 billion; national direct student loans, eliminated entirely; libraries across the country cut by one-fifth; 24 education programs eliminated entirely; Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health, gone; rural housing eliminated; rural health, gone; agricultural extension and research, gone.The list goes on. I could read it all afternoon.These are efforts that everybody could agree are good for the future of this country that only, only the government will perform if this country is to move forward.Now let me end with this:This budget for the second year in a row is not going to happen. The President will veto the implementation of this budget, and what I cannot understand, my friends in the Republican Party, we now have 2 years of no progress.I know my colleagues did not like the President's budget in 1993, but it cut the deficit in half, and most importantly, it got done.This country is not a parliamentary system. Our colleagues cannot do it their way alone. They have to come to the middle, and we have to find a compromise to move this country forward. if our colleagues continue being obstinate and resolute in wanting to do it their way or no way, we get nothing done for the American people.Let us vote this budget down, let us get a budget back on this floor that is somewhere out here in the middle that everybody in this body can support, and let us get this deficit down and balance this budget as we should have done a long time ago.This budget will not live.

Riley, from the Fourth Circuit, found that the plain language of IDEA did not condition the receipt of IDEA funds on the continued provision of educational services to expelled children with disabilities and that in order for Congress to place conditions on the State's receipt of funds, Congress must do so clearly and unambiguously. Therefore, that is one of the reasons the law was changed following that.,2015-03-16 18:12:47.025329,2015-03-16 18:12:47.025329,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-19/html/CREC-1999-05-19-pt1-PgS5507-7.htm,73,453,145,S5507-S5583,A000356,mr. ashcroft
575,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999, President Clinton's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). This proposal will reinvigorate our commitment to high standards and achievement in every classroom; improve teacher and principal quality to ensure high-quality instruction for all children; strengthen accountability for results; and ensure safe, healthy, orderly and drug-free school environments where all children can learn.Established in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, the ESEA opened a new era of Federal support for education, particularly for students who would gain the most: children in our high-poverty communities and those at-risk of educational failure. Today, the ESEA authorizes the Federal government's single largest investment in elementary and secondary education. Through this Act, the Congress and the President will reaffirm and strength the Federal role in promoting academic excellence and equal educational opportunity for every American.This reauthorization of ESEA comes at a critical time for our country. The restructuring of ESEA that was done during the last review in 1994, to establish challenging State-developed standards and assessments, put us on the path to greater academic achievement for all students. This legislation builds upon this focus and targets improvement towards the lowest performing schools and students through comprehensive interventions and assistance, and if necessary, requires consequences for continual failure of schools. Overall, this reauthorization gives Congress the opportunity to complete the work done in 1994 by strengthening our focus on quality and accountability for results.Coupled with the strong emphasis on achievement in this bill is an equally vigorous and complimentary focus on improving the quality of our teaching force. Qualified teachers are the most single critical in-school factor in improving student achievement. Unfortunately, too many of our teachers still do not receive on-going high-quality professional development. This bill refocuses the professional development programs in ESEA to bring the challenging academic standards which all States have developed into the classroom. In addition, this legislation authorizes the President's high-promising 100,000 teacher class-size program enacted as a part of last year's appropriation process. We must ensure that all children in America have talented, dedicated, teachers in small classes and this bill puts on this path.Another important priority in this legislation is the fostering of supportive learning environments that reduces the likelihood of disruptive behavior and school violence while encouraging personal growth and academic development. This legislation strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Act by emphasizing the funding of research-based approaches to violence prevention; expands the comprehensive prevention efforts through the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative; and encourages reform of America's high schools through increased individualized attention and learning.In 1994, Congress and the President worked together to raise standards for all children and to provide a quality education for them to achieve those standards. Five years later, there is evidence that standards-based reform has increased achievement in many states, while helping spark reforms in others. With this bill, we must build upon the accomplishments of 1994. We can no longer tolerate lower expectations and results for poor and disadvantaged students. We must take the next step by helping schools and teachers bring high standards into every classroom and help every child achieve. The legislation I am introducing today will provide us with the tools to accomplish these vital missions.,2015-03-16 18:12:47.142384,2015-03-16 18:12:47.142384,Extensions,INTRODUCTION OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR ALL CHILDREN ACT OF 1999,1999-05-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-26/html/CREC-1999-05-26-pt1-PgE1107.htm,77,0,145,E1107,C000488,mr. clay

577,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.Madam Chairman, next April will mark the 35th anniversary of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a flagship great society program that underscored our country's national commitment to help communities improve their public schools.We have come a long way since the deplorable, segregated, and neglected public schools of yesteryear, but not far enough. Today, too many States and too many communities lack either the political will or the financial resources to ensure that poor children get a good education. Too many poor communities lack fully qualified teachers, safe schools, and access to emerging school technology.Recent reports show that title I is making strides in increasing student achievement. Ten of 12 urban school districts and five of six States reviewed showed increases in the percentage of students in the highest poverty schools who met district or State standards for proficiency in reading and math. These results should serve to broaden our commitment to increase investment in public schools while strengthening accountability for results.I support this legislation because it strengthens our commitment to improve educational opportunities for students, regardless of their race, economic status. Or special needs. It targets funds to our most disadvantaged children and schools, it requires States to have rigorous standards and assessments, and it increases the title I authorization to $8.35 billion.The bill imposes strong sanctions for schools who continue to fail after receiving substantial assistance. It also ensures that teachers and teacher aides are fully qualified. I am very pleased that we will include title VII, bilingual education, as part of the manager's amendment, and I commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Martinez), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa), and the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Romero-Barcelo) on our committee who helped forge a compromise on this critical program.Madam Chairman, H.R. 2 clearly prohibits the use of title I funds for private school vouchers. The proposal to allow vouchers was overwhelmingly rejected by our committee members.The bill is not a perfect bill, however. There are some provisions that undermine programs for women's equity in education, that repeal the Women's Educational Equity Act, that eliminate the provision that trains teachers to eliminate gender bias in the classroom, and terminates dropout prevention programs for pregnant and parenting teens. The gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) have prepared amendments to restore these provisions, and I hope that this body will vote in favor of them.Madam Chairman, I want to thank the subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), for his work on this bill and the committee members on our side, each of whom made important contributions to the bill. I also want to thank the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), and the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle), for working with us in a bipartisan manner.I urge support of H.R. 2.Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:12:47.473626,2015-03-16 18:12:47.473626,House,STUDENT RESULTS ACT OF 1999,1999-10-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-20/html/CREC-1999-10-20-pt1-PgH10408.htm,143,25,145,H10408-H10423,C000488,mr. clay

It contains a provision supporting the transition of our military to the workforce by recognizing the process is too cumbersome for them in terms of credentialing requirements and licensing requirements.What my amendment does is it clarifies this section to ensure that a servicemember's military training, education, and experience shall be taken into account for both Federal and State licensing requirements.These men and women have performed technical jobs in the most difficult circumstances imaginable. We should recognize that and accept their service and their experience and their training and allow them to be easily credentialed when they return home. It helps them so much in the search for jobs.I would ask for a voice vote.,2015-03-16 18:12:47.599709,2015-03-16 18:12:47.599709,Senate,CONCURRENT BUDGET RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2014,2013-03-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-03-22/html/CREC-2013-03-22-pt1-PgS2235-6.htm,43,944,159,S2235-S2320,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

580,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the important issues we are facing today regarding education. I admire the passion with which my colleague from Connecticut has spoken. I simply come to a different conclusion. I think that if we really admire those individuals who work at the local level, we won't distrust them to allocate the resources for their children in their communities, to make good decisions about how the moneys are spent. That is a real contrast to what we have had for quite some time.I wish to give a few examples about how Federal education program requirements eat up resources and they consume a disproportionate amount of the time that States and schools spend on administration. You see, when my constituents come to talk to me, they don't ask me about the process. They are asking me about the product. They are asking me can the students read? Can they spell? Can they compute? Can they reason? They want to be focused on student achievement. They don't want to be focused on whether the money is going to the State or whether the money is going to the Federal bureaucracy. They want something to happen at the end of the process that changes the lives of individuals.As we get into a culture that is more and more technically oriented, the need for education is elevated more and more. In fact, we need to make sure that the money not only gets to the local level, but when it gets there, it can do something of value. And we have a couple of big problems with our current situation. They are primarily these:No. 1, we may get the money to the local level, but only what is left of it after the Federal government and the State bureaucracies consume it with their bureaucratic redtape. So there is a small stream, a very anemic flow, that goes to the local community.No. 2, when we finally get it there, we are frequently telling people at the local community that they have to spend it for something the local community knows isn't really very important.Very few of us would want to get our help, for instance, medically, from someone who was 1,000 miles away and who didn't know anything about our condition. We would want someone who could examine us to find where our problems are and direct a therapy to address those problems. Federal programs from 1,000 miles away designed to make things uniform frequently don't work, and it is because the conditions are different in each community.My colleague from Connecticut boasted of Connecticut's ability to provide uniform salaries for teachers. Then he talked about how unsuccessful it was to have the same salary in one place that you have in another place because the conditions are different. Maybe we should conclude something based on that--that uniformity may not be the answer. Maybe we should conclude that we should give individuals an opportunity to tailor, to adjust, to refine, and to define the resource and its application so that we could have a cause and effect, which is what we are looking for.What is it we are looking for? We are looking for an elevated classroom capacity. We are looking for an elevated human capacity. We are looking for students who can read, write, spell, decipher, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. That is what we want from our schools. That isn't really different from the culture at large.We have passed the century of mass products. Henry Ford was the master of mass production in the 1930s. He said, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so long as it is black.'' He had the best idea, and a centrally driven idea that everybody would drive the same color car. The problem was that 10 years later, after he had 75 percent of the automotive market, he had 50 percent of the automotive market, and he began to understand that it wasn't appropriate to try to tell everybody what they wanted or what their needs were. He changed his slogan. Instead of, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so long as it is black,'' he just shortened it to say, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it''--because he knew he had better meet the need.It is time for us to stop saying you can have your education any color you want it so long as it is bureaucratic. It is time for us to say we want to help you elevate the capacity of students. We are not interested in bureaucracy. We are not interested even in bureaucracy at the State level. We are interested in students. We are interested in classrooms. We are not interested in interest groups. We want to elevate the capacity of students.Listen to what has happened in the Federal Government. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork every year in order for people to receive Federal dollars. That is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time. That is a real cost--25,000 full-time equivalents just processing Federal paperwork. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications States must fill out to receive Federal education funds each year.The Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the smallest Federal Government agencies with only 4,637 people. State agencies, however, have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs, full-time equivalents with Federal dollars to administer the myriad of Federal programs. That doesn't always reflect the total that is necessary at the local level. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally funded employees at State education agencies administering Federal programs as there are U.S. Department of Education employees.I think we need to be thinking carefully about getting the resources to the students. We are facing a situation today in the United States of America where more than half of all the employees in public education are outside the classroom. No wonder people are wondering whether or not we are getting a return on our investment.Where do we want to focus our investment? Do we want to feed the bureaucracy and build the bureaucracy, or do we want to fund the classroom and elevate student performance? We have to look carefully at that.In the State of Florida, it takes 374 employees to administer $8 billion in State funds. It takes almost 400 to do $8 billion in State funds. For the $1 billion in Federal funds, it takes almost 300 employees. Basically, there are six times as many hours required to administer one dollar of Federal funds as there are hours required to administer one dollar of State funds. That puts us in a situation where there is a lot of money being spent on administration trying to make sure we have complied with all of the Federal requirements and working to satisfy the Federal mandate instead of working to educate the children.I submit that we ought to look at these statistics. We find that it is not surprising that the Federal bureaucratic maze consumes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars. These Federal programs and their requirements take away not only precious dollars, but they take up valuable teacher time.I don't think there is much question about what we want. I don't think this is a partisan issue. All of us in the end want students to be able to achieve. The educational system is not for the bureaucracy. It is not for Washington. It is not for the State capitals. It is not for making people fill out forms to comply with Federal rules. Clearly, we can't afford for this trend to continue. We need to change our Federal policies to ensure a more efficient use of our Federal resources. I would be pleased to yield to the manager on my side for a comment or unanimous consent request.,2015-03-16 18:12:47.889915,2015-03-16 18:12:47.889915,Senate,EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT--Resumed,2000-05-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-03/html/CREC-2000-05-03-pt1-PgS3284-2.htm,53,140,146,S3284-S3322,A000356,mr. ashcroft

From commerce, to the arts, to education, medicine, the law, government, and in our armed forces.Jewish Americans have enriched our Nation and contributed much to our shared cultural heritage.I also want to make special mention of the long and historic partnership between the African American and the Jewish American communities, in the pursuit of social justice, civil rights, voting rights and equal protection under the law.During the most trying times of the civil rights movement, Jewish Americans and African Americans marched together, stood together, protested together, prayed together, and even died together, to advance the cause of full citizenship and real equality for all.That partnership and common pursuit of justice endures today.In my district, I am blessed to represent a large, vibrant Jewish community with many outstanding congregations, educational and cultural groups and social service agencies; including: the Jewish Federation of St. Louis; the Jewish Community Center; Jewish Family and Childrens Services; the Jewish Community Relations Council; the St. Louis Holocaust Museum and Learning Center, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the Central Agency for Jewish Education, and many others.Jewish Americans have helped shape our Nation's history, and their unending commitment to faith, family, learning and social justice will continue to strengthen the United States.I am proud to join with my colleagues to mark Jewish American Heritage Month.,2015-03-16 18:12:48.552415,2015-03-16 18:12:48.552415,Extensions,JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH,2010-05-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-05-20/html/CREC-2010-05-20-pt1-PgE907-2.htm,77,0,156,E907,C001049,mr. clay

We've got the Federal Government now, they're into the automobile business, the insurance business, the student loan business, they're in the flood insurance business, they're in the food business, they're in the housing business.It kind of reminds me, there was this country that I grew up paying close attention to in the U.S., and it had this philosophy that the government is going to give you food, and it's going to give you a place to live, some shelter, it's going to give you an education, the government's going to give you a job and it's going to give you health care. We looked at that country and thought, That's not going to work. And it didn't work. The whole country crashed economically. It was called the USSR.Here we are today, and what does the Federal Government try to do? Give people housing and food and education and a job and health care. How are we different? What we have to understand is the Federal Government has to be reined in to do just what it's supposed to do, which is justice. That is, provide a set of laws where everybody is equal before the law and a national security that protects us from terrorists and other people that wish us ill. So that Federal Government is just going to have to go on a diet.,2015-03-16 18:12:48.674478,2015-03-16 18:12:48.674478,House,THE GOVERNMENT, THE ECONOMY AND JOBS,2010-07-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-07-14/html/CREC-2010-07-14-pt1-PgH5603.htm,104,69,156,H5603-H5610,A000358,mr. akin
587,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Catholic Schools Week.Next week, the Nation's nearly 8,000 Catholic schools will celebrate Catholic Schools Week. Catholic schools have made many significant contributions to the education of our Nation's children.In the Greater St. Louis region, Catholic schools have had a longstanding and proud tradition in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. The percentage of Catholic families who choose Catholic schools for their children is among the highest in the country. Currently, there are about 51,000 students enrolled in our Catholic elementary and high schools.Catholic schools foster an atmosphere of mutual respect. Students learn to value God, themselves, and others. As Pope Benedict XVI noted in his remarks at Catholic University during his Apostolic Visit to the U.S. last spring, ``Education is integral to the mission of the Church to proclaim the Good News. First and foremost every Catholic educational institution is a place to encounter the living God who in Jesus Christ reveals his transforming love and truth. This relationship elicits a desire to grow in the knowledge and understanding of Christ and his teaching. In this way those who meet him are drawn by the very power of the Gospel to lead a new life characterized by all that is beautiful, good, and true; a life of Christian witness nurtured and strengthened within the community of our Lord's disciples, the Church.''Today I would like to recognize and commend our Catholic educators who are committed to a living and vibrant faith community founded on the Catholic tradition of academic excellence and thank them for enriching the lives of the children they teach spiritually, academically and socially.I strongly support the goals of Catholic Schools Week 2009 and laud their efforts to educate students dedicated to their faith, families, and values.,2015-03-16 18:12:48.799590,2015-03-16 18:12:48.799590,House,HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2009-01-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-21/html/CREC-2009-01-21-pt1-PgH398.htm,12,21,155,H398-H402,A000358,mr. akin

589,MO,Todd,Akin,R,If you would yield, gentleman, one of the things somebody once said--and I was not a whiz on taking history in high school--but if you don't learn from history, you are bound to repeat mistakes. And I do recall a very threatening and ominous nation that we saw taking over country after country called the Soviet Union. If you were to try to just simplify their philosophy, it was that government was going to take care of food, clothing and shelter. They were going to pay for your education, set you up with a job, and take care of your health care. We laughed when that country collapsed, a little bit with a sense of anxiety because they had nuclear weapons aimed at us and all. We said, you know that Communist/Socialist stuff won't work. Their economy was a mess. They couldn't keep up with us in the arms race because their economy was a disaster. The government can't run all that stuff efficiently. People starved to death over there. Their medical care was so abysmal, people that went into their hospitals would shudder. There was no anaesthetic, no clean bandages. It was a disaster.And when the whole thing went down the drain, we said, Everybody knows Communism/Socialism won't work. So what are we proposing now? The government's going to provide food. The government's going to provide housing. The government's going to provide your education. We just decided to nationalize a whole lot more of that. No more private loans. We're going to have the government take care of all that. And now we're talking about the government--not only the insurance and the automotive, but now the government wants to take over one-fifth of the economy in terms of health care.Now, it seems to me we should learn something from history, don't you think, gentleman?,2015-03-16 18:12:49.088796,2015-03-16 18:12:49.088796,House,FREE ENTERPRISE AND THE INVISIBLE HAND,2009-09-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-09-16/html/CREC-2009-09-16-pt1-PgH9646.htm,131,10,155,H9646-H9653,A000358,mr. akin

Under their leadership, our committee has produced a remarkable amount of quality legislation, including this bill before the House tonight.Our country's global competitiveness is directly linked to the ability of our math, science and engineering professionals to develop innovative technologies, policies and scientific breakthroughs.Yet while it is important to support these professionals and their industries today, it is perhaps of even greater importance to support their professions and industries of tomorrow.In order for our Nation to compete with countries around the world, we must ensure that we increase the educational opportunities for our youth to study and pursue careers in math, science and engineering, while also investing in programs to enrich the quality of these opportunities.Making both research and the education of our children a national priority is not simply an investment in these fields. Our global competitiveness is directly tied to our Nation's economy and national security.NSF plays a critical role in influencing our global competitiveness as it supports science and engineering across all disciplines.Each year NSF supports an average of about 200,000 scientists, engineers, educators and students at universities, laboratories and field sites all over the U.S., including many great institutions in my home State of Missouri.H.R. 1867 authorizes the necessary funds for NSF which will allow the agency to foster relationships between academia and industry in order to spawn U.S. competitiveness and further the Agency's traditions of education in science, technology, engineering and math, the STEM, fields.I urge my colleagues to invest in the future of our children, in our country's global competitiveness and support this bill.

Catholic schools not only teach our kids how to think, but also teach them how to live.Catholic schools have always been known for their high academic standards and excellent teachers, but I would like to draw your attention to their ability to provide more than just an excellent academic education. The Catholic schools in my district are a perfect example of this--providing children from a young age with a moral foundation which leads them to serve their community through out their lives.It was strong religious and moral beliefs that drove our Nation's Founders to develop a country where individual freedom is coupled with individual responsibility. Catholic schools across our great Nation continue to produce students who understand their responsibility and act accordingly. The values imparted and the strong faith that Catholic schools develop in their students produces citizens who understand the importance of service and diligently work for the good of our country. I am honored to represent a district where numerous Catholic schools provide a rigorous academic education and a moral compass to guide students through their lives. Catholic schools in Missouri's Second Congressional District and throughout the St. Louis region produce well-rounded and morally grounded members of our community. The teachers, administrators, parents, and students of Catholic schools deserve this recognition for the tremendously positive impact they have on our Nation. These schools will continue to play a significant role in developing responsible American citizens for our future generations.,2015-03-16 18:12:49.611167,2015-03-16 18:12:49.611167,House,HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS,2006-02-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-02-08/html/CREC-2006-02-08-pt1-PgH174.htm,14,32,152,H174-H180,A000358,mr. akin

The Pearce Award is the most prestigious honor that can be bestowed on a school superintendent in the State of Missouri, particularly so because the honoree is selected by a committee of peers.The Ritenour School District in St. Louis County has been fortunate to have the leadership skills of Dr. Doerrer for the past 35 years. The Missouri Legislature and State board of education were in the forefront and enacted standards-based education long before the passage of No Child Left Behind. In fact, the standards set in Missouri are among the highest in the Nation. Under the able instructional leadership of Dr. Doerrer, the Ritenour School District has not only met but in many cases has exceeded the rigorous goals our State has set for student achievement of adequate yearly progress. In addition, under Dr. Doerrer's able leadership, the Ritenour School District was recently named as one of the ``Best Places to Work'' by the St. Louis Business Journal.Dr. Doerrer has truly exemplified instructional leadership in our State. Whether it is staff development, instructional technology, human resources, or data driven decisionmaking, Dr. Doerrer has provided the vision and energy that has brought distinction to the Ritenour School District.

595,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, S. Con. Res. 114, sponsored by my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Jim McGovern, calls to attention one of America's most important humanitarian missions--alleviating the suffering of the world's starving children. Hunger claims more lives worldwide than HIV and AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined; a tragedy.Critical to feeding starving children is the McGovern-Dole International Food and Education and Child Nutrition Program, which provides hungry children around the world at least one nutritious meal each day in a school setting. This program has proven effective at reducing child hunger, increasing academic attendance and performance, and strengthening community commitment to education.The McGovern-Dole program currently feeds two million children a year. That's two million children who will attend school. Two million children who will not have to suffer through an afternoon of stomach pain from too little nutrition. Two million children who will grow up knowing that America cares, that America is willing to help those most in need. Today, more than ever, it is vital that individuals living in impoverish areas across the world look to the United States as an ally, and more than that, a partner.For these reasons, I am encouraged to see that the Agriculture Appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year, that the House overwhelmingly passed yesterday, included a $25 million increase for the McGovern-Dole program. Chairman Henry Bonilla of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am a member, demonstrated his compassion for the world's malnourished children by supporting the President's proposed increase for this program. This increase will make a significant difference.This resolution is right on target: A humanitarian crisis exists in the world and the McGovern-Dole program is part of the solution. I urge my colleagues to support this meaningful resolution.,2015-03-16 18:12:49.855319,2015-03-16 18:12:49.855319,House,CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD IN SCHOOLS TO HUNGRY OR MALNOURISHED CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD,2004-07-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-07-14/html/CREC-2004-07-14-pt1-PgH5752.htm,97,13,150,H5752-H5757,E000172,mrs. emerson

597,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 150th anniversary of Culver-Stockton College, which is located in Canton, Missouri.Culver-Stockton College was founded as Christian University by early leaders of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Canton, Missouri was chosen as the school's location based on the close proximity to the Mississippi River and the enthusiasm for higher education shared by the Lewis County Disciples. The State of Missouri issued the college's charter on January 28, 1853. In 1917, Christian University was renamed Culver-Stockton College to honor benefactors Mary Culver and Robert Stockton.Culver-Stockton's visionary founders were clearly ahead of their time. The school was the first college chartered west of the Mississippi River to educate both men and women. As both Christian University and Culver-Stockton College, the school has compiled a proud record of accomplishment and has made a meaningful contribution to the community throughout its history.The forward-thinking ideas that are the foundation for Culver-Stockton College still influence the school today. Culver-Stockton is a 4-year residential, coeducational college that asks its students to realize their full potential. The college's alumni are living proof of the professional, personal and social service development that is cultivated on Culver-Stockton's campus. The college's administration, faculty and staff are committed to educational excellence, character development, and the integration of liberal arts.In recent years, Culver-Stockton has achieved distinctions that include being named one of America's Best Christian Colleges, inclusion in the Templeton Foundation's ``Colleges that Encourage Character Development'' and membership in the Lilly Fellows Program in Humanities and the Arts.With its Sesquicentennial Gala Week, Culver-Stockton College launches a year-long celebration of its 150-year history. This provides the opportunity to not only reflect on the school's past contributions, but to appreciate the important role the college continues to play in educating our future leaders.

These endowment programs are vital to supporting the creation, preservation and presentation of the arts and humanities in America. In my district of Kansas City, Missouri, NEA and NEH grants have brought partnership projects such as the Coterie Theater and the Friends of Alvin Ailey's AileyCamp that help provide collaborative artist and youth activities which have enriched the local economy and educational experiences of our children.Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. A U.S. Department of Justice study found that arts education reduced student delinquency in San Antonio by 13 percent and increased the communications skills of students in Atlanta by 57 percent. Test Results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores than other students.There is no excuse for funding for the NEA at a level that is 30 percent below the 1994 level. Adopting the amendment before us would increase funding by $10 million for NEA and $5 million for the NEH. This would bring NEA and NEH funding to the level that the House approved last year by a vote of 234-192, but was later stripped from the bill in conference. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Investment in the arts and humanities has proven to be an invaluable contribution to American economy and the future success of our children.,2015-03-16 18:12:50.251594,2015-03-16 18:12:50.251594,House,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004,2003-07-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-07-16/html/CREC-2003-07-16-pt1-PgH6950-4.htm,105,110,149,H6950-H6984,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

This month marks the 50th anniversary of Central Bank's service to the residents and businesses of Northeast Kansas City.Chartered in August of 1950, this financial institution has remained a stronghold in the community throughout the cultural and economic changes and growth that have occurred since it opened its doors. Through expansion and innovative services, Central Bank has demonstrated and continues to live up to its commitment and dedication to Northeast Kansas City.The American Bankers Association Banking Journal considers Central Bank of Kansas City one of the top performing banks in its category. A leader in community development, the bank joined with Old Northeast, Inc. Community Development Corporation, in 1999, to construct thirty new homes in the Northeast Community for low and moderate income families. Central Bank has also partnered with the Kansas City Neighborhood Alliance and Bishop Sullivan Community Center in an effort to revitalize housing in the Blue Valley neighborhood. In addition to promoting housing and small business initiatives such as the First Step Fund designed to assist small business entrepreneurs, they serve on the Safe Neighborhood Grant Advisory Council, which addresses the quality of life for the residents.Quality education is another priority of Central Bank. They participate in the ``Bank at School'' program which gives fifth grade students basic bank training.

600,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today on National Teachers Day in honor of this important day.I was able to cosponsor this legislation along with the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Clement), my co-chair of the House Education Caucus, with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Chairman Goodling) and the gentleman from California (Chairman McKeon) and others.One out of five Members of the House, including the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), who drafted this resolution, have been full-time educators at one time in their career. Members of this House know from personal experience what it is like to be in the classroom, to be an administrator, to work with the responsibilities of teachers.This resolution honors and recognizes the unique and important achievement of America's teachers. It urges all Americans to take a moment to thank teachers and pay tribute to our Nation's teachers.I would like to mention just briefly a teacher in the Springfield school district that is being recognized this week as the Teacher of the Year in that district.Ms. Mae Tribble originally aspired to be a pediatric nurse so she could help others in need. However, while she was in college at Southwest Missouri State University and while working with the Springfield Park Board, she discovered the challenge and the reward of teaching. She has now taught for 27 years. She currently teaches the second grade at Pittman Elementary School. She has taught at other schools in the Springfield district and the Strafford district. Her education includes teaching first grade, second grade, disabilities K-6, reading and math. She is an outstanding teacher.Teachers make a difference in people's lives, Mr. Speaker. They expand our only expandable resource, the potential of young people, the potential of our country. I am glad we recognize them today.,2015-03-16 18:12:50.533802,2015-03-16 18:12:50.533802,House,SENSE OF THE HOUSE IN SUPPORT OF AMERICA'S TEACHERS,2000-05-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-09/html/CREC-2000-05-09-pt1-PgH2726.htm,56,10,146,H2726-H2734,B000575,mr. blunt
601,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my constituents who passed away several years ago after a long, rich life. The community is still impacted by her wonderful example of patience and kindness. I salute Mrs. Roberta Rowe who, 26 years after her passing, will have a park in Sikeston, MO, rededicated to her for her inspirational life.Originally from Georgia, Mrs. Roberta Rowe came to Southeast Missouri with her five children, Mable, Alma, Eloise, Kathryn, and Carlton.She soon became involved in her community as the leader of the Rainbow 4-H Club where she held meetings, arranged educational projects for the members and accompanied the club to Lincoln University every year for the annual state conference.Mrs. Rowe was also an active member in Smith Chapel United Methodist Church throughout her life. She was a kindergarten teacher for the church, and often worked with the children in various activities. You could always find her cheerful spirit at a church function.Always involved with the Bootheel community, Mrs. Rowe traveled with the Community Choir for monthly choir concerts in the African American Churches of the region. Monthly she would go to Benton along with her Smith Chapel friends, Mrs. Rosie Johnson, Mrs. Flora Holt, and Ms. Edna to learn about effective homemaking techniques through the University of Missouri Extension Club. She served as a teen supervisor during the summer, teaching them about lawncare and lawnscaping.Although she did not complete high school herself, she pushed her children to pursue a strong education. Her twins, Carlton and Kathryn, completed college at Lincoln University, and the rest of her children spent time in college as well.Mrs. Rowe's dedication to her family, her church, her community and education should be an inspiration to us all. Those who followed her example learned that ``greatness comes from service.'' It is her greatness that is remembered in Sikeston, and by her family.,2015-03-16 18:17:25.950593,2015-03-16 18:17:25.950593,Extensions,RECOGNIZING ROBERTA ROWE FOR A LIFETIME OF COMMUNITY SERVICE,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgE1862-4.htm,132,0,146,E1862,E000172,mrs. emerson
602,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a truly outstanding University in my home State of Missouri, Lincoln University. Lincoln has played a large role in African American education in my home State of Missouri, as well as across the nation.Lincoln was founded in 1866 by the Caucasian officers and the African American enlisted men of the 62nd and 65th United States Colored Infantries who fought for the Union during the Civil War. These men wanted to establish a school that would devote itself to educating freed African Americans. By soliciting funds and donating their own salaries, they raised $6,000 within a few days. With these funds, the soldiers were able to open the doors of Lincoln Institute on September 17, 1866. In 1869, Lincoln began to receive $5,000 in aid from the State of Missouri for teacher training. By 1940, Lincoln Institute had become Lincoln University and had evolved from a teacher training school to a full University offering Graduate instruction. In each of the decades Lincoln has continually added programs, expanded its facilities and opened its doors to all applicants that meet its entrance criteria.This past year the University has come under the new leadership of Dr. David Henson. Dr. Henson became the seventeenth President of Lincoln on July 2, 1997. I am excited about continuing my close relationship with this outstanding University by working with Dr. Henson. He has held many leadership positions during his 25 years of higher education and I know he will continue to strengthen the University's already impeccable reputation.It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a University like Lincoln, whose service and character-building programs, along with the new guidance of Dr. Henson, will continue down the road of success. I commend Lincoln's President, Dr. David Henson, for his commitment to excellence and hope for continued prosperity in the future. ,2015-03-16 18:17:26.073653,2015-03-16 18:17:26.073653,Senate,TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN UNIVERSITY,1998-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-31/html/CREC-1998-03-31-pt1-PgS2877-3.htm,39,0,144,S2877-S2878,B000611,mr. bond

Now, more than ever, we must rely on the skills and productivity of American workers. Education and job training programs provide the opportunity to learn and improve skills. We must make sure that those programs are as effective as possible. So I am pleased to be a part of the effort to improve the quality of our education and training system, while eliminating duplication of efforts and unnecessary bureaucracy.Let me express my gratitude to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon), and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for their hard work on the House legislation. Also, for their continued efforts to move this bill through conference and on to the President's desk.I am pleased that there is broad agreement, Mr. Speaker, one, to foster the development of one-stop intake systems that will provide comprehensive information on the kinds of assistance available to those seeking help; two, to tailor job training assistance to the particular needs of each individual; three, to provide those seeking assistance with comprehensive consumer information about the quality of programs; four, to improve the quality of training and the accountability of the system; and five, to streamline and coordinate the delivery of services.Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the conference report.Mr. Speaker, continuing my reservation of objection, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon).,2015-03-16 18:17:26.184733,2015-03-16 18:17:26.184733,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1385, WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998,1998-07-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-31/html/CREC-1998-07-31-pt1-PgH6865.htm,106,4,144,H6865-H6867,C000488,mr. clay

This chamber has faithfully served the cities of Ballwin, Clarkson Valley, Ellisville, Manchester, Valley Park, Wildwood, Winchester, and parts of unincorporated St. Louis County, MO.Established on May 13, 1957, as the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce, the chamber was founded to enrich the communities of the West St. Louis County corridor. At its first meeting held in the basement of Ballwin Elementary School, the chamber dedicated itself to improving the quality of education, highways, and sewer systems. From these humble beginnings, the West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce has grown into one of the most dynamic and progressive chambers in this region. With 385 members and 601 representatives, the chamber continues to advance commercial, industrial, and civic interest, as well as enhancing the community environment within cities and unincorporated areas.The West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce currently is involved in numerous activities including: monitoring local, State, and Federal legislative issues of specific interest to business; maintaining a proactive status to improve transportation facilities and services; publishing an annual ``Buyer's Guide and Membership Directory'' which is distributed to 50,000 residents; soliciting of new businesses and residents to the area; acts as a clearinghouse for information for prospective new businesses; and offers its members opportunities for networking, advertising, education, and referrals.Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in congratulating the membership of the West St. Louis County Chamber of Commerce on this occasion.

605,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Shepard Accelerated School in my district for being named a national Blue Ribbon School recipient.The Blue Ribbon Schools Program identifies and gives national recognition to a diverse group of public and private schools that are unusually effective in meeting local, State, and national goals and in educating all of their students. The program seeks to promote school improvement nationwide through the collaborative self-evaluation required of local school communities that participate. In addition, recognized schools serve as models for other schools and communities seeking to provide high quality education for all their students.Shepard Accelerated School was one of only 264 schools across the United States recognized as a Blue Ribbon School. Now, you might think that sounds like a lot of schools. But think about this--there are about 76,000 public and private elementary and middle schools in America. That means that one out of every 288 elementary and middle schools in the entire United States has been named a Blue Ribbon School for 1997. And I'm pleased that Shepard Accelerated School right here in St. Louis, MO, is one of those schools.To qualify for this award, I know Shepard went through rigorous reviews by some of the Nation's leading educators. The school impressed everybody and they deserve the highest praise for that. The innovative programs and supportive community Shepard has established truly demonstrate the importance of a positive learning environment.Shepard Accelerated School has a shared purpose among faculty, students, and parents to improve the education of the 600 children who attend. I am proud of Shepard for being named a national Blue Ribbon School recipient. Ms. Savannah Young, all the teachers, and especially the students should be saluted for their dedication to high standards and excellence in teaching and learning.Congratulations Shepard Accelerated School.,2015-03-16 18:17:26.451923,2015-03-16 18:17:26.451923,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE SHEPARD ACCELERATED SCHOOL,1997-06-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-17/html/CREC-1997-06-17-pt1-PgE1229.htm,84,0,143,E1229,G000132,mr. gephardt
606,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his having made it possible for me to stand and speak in favor of this very important opportunity to demonstrate what can happen when we offer individuals the chance to have competition, or the chance to have an influence on where our children are educated.It is one of the agreed upon successes of the United States of America that our university and college system is second to none. Students from all over the world stream into American colleges and universities, and they come here in spite of the fact that they test very, very well in elementary and secondary systems in their own lands. They come here because there is something special about the collegiate and university level in the United States.If I were asked why our collegiate system is tops, I would say, in my judgment, that it is because it is a pluralistic system; that it is diverse. There is no singularity with it. No one is scheduled to go to one school or another. Rather, people have an opportunity to make a selection. And students compete to get into the best schools and the best schools compete for faculty. There is lots of competition in the system. It drives the system forward. It provides a basis for not only education and learning on the part of students but it really develops the energy which provides the basis for research which is expanding the frontiers of knowledge all the time.This concept of diversity, this concept of pluralism, this concept of not being forced to be in one setting, this concept of the energy and creativity, spontaneity and quality that comes when an institution knows it has to do its best for its students because those students aren't forced to go there. They are not locked in. They have the opportunity to be involved in educational experiences elsewhere. That is what drives quality. It is what has carried American higher education to the very top of the educational mountain. There is no dispute. There is no challenger. Second place isn't even close. The United States of America is the clear dominant force in higher education because we are pluralistic, because we are diverse, and no one has a monopoly.On the contrary, if you are a student and you have one choice and one choice alone, the word ``one'' and the word ``choice'' Is an oxymoron; that phrase together. One choice isn't a choice. It is a direction. Students that are locked into a single school don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I will go elsewhere. They don't have the capacity to say if you do not shape this place up, I will go elsewhere. They don't have the capacity to energize the system. A parent doesn't have the ability to go into the school and say you must do better. The school says we are the only school. You have one choice. One choice is no choice.What we are really offering to individuals who have been locked into a school system which has failed--I think it is time for us to confess, the school system in Washington, DC, is a failure--is a plan to help energize this school system. It will help the public sector. It will help the private sector. But, most importantly, it will help students and parents.When I had the privilege of being the Governor of my State, I was chairman of the Education Commission of the States. I followed in that responsibility one William Jefferson Clinton, who presided over the Education Commission of the States 1 year; I the next. And one of the things that became apparent in studies conducted from sea to shining sea in this country is that the single most important thing about a student's performance is whether the parents are involved in the education process. How do you get parents involved? You make them meaningful. How can you make parents meaningful in Washington, DC? You can give them the opportunity together with the student to make a choice to go to a school where their needs can be met instead of locking them into a situation where their needs aren't being met and have not been met. And it is a demonstrated fact--the studies tell it, the audits tell it, the school facilities tell it--that the needs aren't being met.Unfortunately, our Secretary of Education has come out to oppose this program providing scholarships so that students could move from one school to another and get good training somewhere if they are not getting it where they are. And he indicated he was opposing it because he felt like it was reducing the funding.Let me just repeat. This particular measure reduces funding not 1 cent. It adds funding to just introduce the concept of scholarships and to put into the hands of parents and students the ability to say we will go where our needs are met. Will this help the District of Columbia schools? It definitely will because they will understand they are no longer the exclusive provider of whatever it is they want to provide. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of what it is that students need. Will it help the students? Obviously, it will help the students. It will get their parents involved. It will get them involved. It will meet their needs. And we will establish a model here in the District of Columbia, in the Nation's Capital, which in my judgment would well serve the entire country.It is true that pluralism and diversity are the strength of this great land. They have carried our collegiate system and our research universities to the very top in education around the globe. It would be no accident if we were to allow this to happen at the elementary and secondary level. And it could happen if we were to simply embrace the opportunity of letting parents make meaningful choices. One choice is an oxymoron. One choice is no choice at all. It is a trap. It is time to free students and parents to have an opportunity to select schools that can meet their needs and do so without impairing the financial viability and capacity of the District of Columbia school system in the process.Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.,2015-03-16 18:17:26.617040,2015-03-16 18:17:26.617040,Senate,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998,1997-09-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-09-25/html/CREC-1997-09-25-pt1-PgS9925-3.htm,130,16,143,S9925-S9940,A000356,mr. ashcroft
607,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of NFL's finest defensive players and one of Kansas City's finest citizens, Neil Smith of the Kansas City Chiefs. Mr. Smith is in Washington today to accept a prestigious award from the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce [JAYCEES] which has selected Neil Smith as a member of the Congress of Ten Outstanding Young Americans.Neil Smith spent his childhood struggling in school with a learning disability. He was in junior high school before the education system acknowledged his special challenges and helped him discover ways in which he could learn and succeed. Neil Smith will never forget the cruel labels placed on children with dyslexia. That is why today he dedicates time and energy to help youngsters living with learning disabilities.As a former educator, I personally appreciate Mr. Smith's selfless efforts to heighten public awareness and find solutions for individuals with disabilities. He is the national spokesperson for Foundation for Exceptional Children's ``Yes I Can'' Program which encourages disabled children to reach their goals and recognizes their many achievements. He recently partnered with the Learning Disabilities Association of Missouri to fund and produce a public service announcement aimed at dispelling the misconception that children with learning disabilities are ``dumb'' or ``slow''. He says they just need to be shown things in a different way.Neil Smith's efforts remind the Congress that these youth need the support of an education system that works for them, not against them. All children have dreams and each and every one of them deserves the opportunity to achieve those dreams just as Neil Smith has. In Mr. Smith's words, ``People with learning disabilities are not unfortunate. The unfortunate people are quarterbacks.'' Thank you, Neil, for your dedication to our children and your inspiring energy both on and off the field.,2015-03-16 18:17:26.776152,2015-03-16 18:17:26.776152,Extensions,NEIL SMITH, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HONORED,1996-03-14,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-14/html/CREC-1996-03-14-pt1-PgE357-3.htm,35,0,142,E357,M000316,ms. mccarthy

It is a great pleasure to recognize Sister Mary Benita for her 60th anniversary in the religious profession and for her life-long dedication to serving others.A former member of St. Munchin's Parish in Cameron, MO, Sister Mary Benita entered the Sisters of Mercy novitiate in Council Bluffs, IA, on August 6, 1933. She made her first vows in March, 1936, and in August of the same year was assigned to teach business education, English, and religion classes at St. Mary's High School in Independence, MO. Following teaching assignments at Glennon High School, Kansas City, and the College of St. Mary's in Omaha, NE, Sister Mary Benita was once again assigned to St. Mary's, Independence.After completing 40 years of teaching, Sister Mary Benita became active in St. Mary's Parish Council where she served as parish ministries coordinator. As director of social ministries for the parish, she coordinated St. Vincent de Paul's outreach to the poor, the Legion of Mary's evangelization efforts, youth service activities, the Over 50 Club and Marian ministry. She continues her ministry to the hospitalized and homebound.Sister Mary Benita has been an active member of the Neighborhood Council, a board member on Meals on Wheels, has participated in neighborhood education programs and has held a continued interest in St. Mary's High School Alumni activities.Currently, Sister Mary is sponsoring faith development groups and is the librarian for the parish library. It is an honor to congratulate Sister Mary Benita on her long-lasting faithfulness to the Church and the Independence community.

I immediately had a certain affection for this project. First and foremost, this project would be located in my hometown of Mexico, Missouri. Second, the local leaders came to me with one of the most comprehensive partnerships that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. The partners included Linn State Technical College, the University of Missouri, Moberly Area Community College, the Mexico Area Vocational and Technical School, the City of Mexico, and the State of Missouri. Third, the Advanced Technical Center would provide students with exceptional educational opportunities through highly specialized and advanced technical education and training at the certificate and degree levels in both emerging and traditional technologies.In the fall of 1997, the Senate approved and the President signed the appropriation bill providing $1 million in Federal funds for the Advanced Technical Center in Mexico, Missouri. The federal support recognized that the key to staying competitive in today's global marketplace is investing in education and training of our current and future workers. The federal funds, in conjunction with the local and state funds, made this project a reality.This Friday, June 18, 1999, the Advanced Technical Center will celebrate its Grand Opening. I am looking forward to being a part of the celebration. But, more importantly, I am proud to have been a participant in the successful partnership that has led to the creation of a model, state-of-the-art technical training and learning facility in my hometown of Mexico, MO. ,2015-03-16 18:17:26.998309,2015-03-16 18:17:26.998309,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,1999-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-06-15/html/CREC-1999-06-15-pt1-PgS7033-3.htm,84,0,145,S7033-S7034,B000611,mr. bond
610,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I rise today in strong support of the bipartisan amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii, and others, to reauthorize the Women's Educational Equity Act and to reaffirm the commitment of this House to the principle of gender equity. The amendment enables States and schools to eliminate the historic gender bias in education materials through teacher training and will encourage the participation of girls and minorities in high-tech careers.Madam Chairman, I was a high school English teacher 25 years ago, when Congress made a commitment to encourage women to pursue quality educational opportunities. Congress authorized and appropriated funds to teach teachers how to break the cycles of sexism and gender bias. I can remember discussing with my high school students the possibility of a woman in space, and that conversation was met with general scoffing by the boys in the class and doubt by the girls in the class. But I had the honor, along with a number of women in this Congress to watch the first woman be commander of a NASA spaceship. This year, Eileen Collins proved this effort has made a difference.For 25 years, Congress has reaffirmed its commitment. We have stood by the teachers and the young women, and we have begun to see real results. Test scores are improving; women are staying in school longer; and career choices are slowly expanding. The glass ceiling has not been shattered but it is moving, Madam Chairman. Sixty-five percent of all jobs in the year 2010 will require some technology skills. Do not let that ceiling come crashing back down on the young women of today.Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Mink amendment for education equity.,2015-03-16 18:17:27.215465,2015-03-16 18:17:27.215465,House,STUDENT RESULTS ACT OF 1999,1999-10-20,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-20/html/CREC-1999-10-20-pt1-PgH10423-2.htm,143,60,145,H10423-H10514,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
611,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, this motion asks that we recommit this bill for the purpose of addressing the real education priorities of parents, of teachers, and of local communities. It calls for the House to scrap this ill-conceived and this misguided bill and pass legislation to reduce class sizes in the early grades, to repair crumbling and overcrowded schools, and to ensure all teachers are fully qualified.Rather than gutting the hard work we accomplished today by passing increased accountability and targeting of funds to poor schools, we can build on H.R. 2 by addressing the priorities in this motion. Reducing class size is one of the most important investments we can make to improve student achievement.Last year we made a down payment to hire 100,000 new teachers by passing the Clinton/Clay Class Size Reduction Act. Too many of our schools have 30 or more children pressed desk-to-desk in classrooms. This is unacceptable. We all know and studies confirm that children learn better in small early classes.Today, over one-third of our public schools are dilapidated and in need of replacement or major modernization. For years Democrats have been demanding action on this urgent education priority, but the majority continues to block action.It is a national shame, Mr. Speaker, that one of the most hallowed institutions in our Nation, the public schoolhouse, has been allowed to fall into such disrepair. We think our children deserve the right to attend schools in a safe, well-maintained building that is capable of using modern educational technology.The Rangel school modernization bill helps communities address this urgent priority by allowing the issuance of interest-free bonds. We should act now to pass the Rangel school construction bill.Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this motion to recommit.,2015-03-16 18:17:27.359585,2015-03-16 18:17:27.359585,House,ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL ACT (STRAIGHT A's ACT),1999-10-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-21/html/CREC-1999-10-21-pt1-PgH10685-3.htm,144,125,145,H10685-H10715,C000488,mr. clay

Diane's volunteer career extends across the community, including roles as a docent at the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art; Chapter and Reciprocity President of P.E.O.; and an elder, deacon and committee member to the First Presbyterian Church. As Area Coordinator for Phi Delta Kappa, she traveled the western part of Missouri encouraging quality education. She has also contributed her time and talents to the Calla Varner Board, the Junior League, the Flower Society, the St. Joseph Symphony, and the Performing Arts Association, among others. With an enthusiastic personality and a ``can-do'' attitude, Diane Watson has become an outstanding community volunteer and an admired friend to many--all of which she humbly attributes to ``going wherever the Lord leads.''Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Diane Watson. She has made an amazing impact on countless individuals in the St. Joseph community. I am honored to represent her in the United States Congress.,2015-03-16 18:17:27.477649,2015-03-16 18:17:27.477649,Extensions,DIANE WATSON,2012-06-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-06-18/html/CREC-2012-06-18-pt1-PgE1053-4.htm,92,0,158,E1053,G000546,mr. graves of missouri
613,MO,Billy,Long,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Melanie Ward.Melanie was recently chosen as a member of the U.S. Army All-American Marching Band, a national honor ensemble for outstanding musician-scholars.Each year, only 125 students are chosen from the thousands who apply to the Army All-American Marching Band. Only students with superior musical ability, academic achievement, and positive standing in the community are selected to represent their school in this elite group. Students are selected by the National Association for Music Education to represent their state and local communities at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas.Melanie was selected for one of twenty positions reserved for the band's color guard and she certainly fits the mold for this elite group. She is the editor of the Parkview High School yearbook, an award winning cross country runner and captain of the school band's color guard.The marching band members will perform for thousands of active duty military members at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in January. The U.S. Army All-American Bowl is a football game made up of the best high school seniors from around the country. Together, the marching band and football team represent the best their schools have to offer in the arts and physical education.Mr. Speaker, Melanie's hard work and determination in both academics and music have earned her a spot on the U.S. Army All-American Marching Band. I am proud of her achievements and honored to call her a neighbor in the 7th Congressional District of Missouri.,2015-03-16 18:17:27.644953,2015-03-16 18:17:27.644953,Extensions,RECOGNIZING MELANIE WARD,2012-10-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2012-10-30/html/CREC-2012-10-30-pt1-PgE1729-3.htm,140,0,158,E1729,L000576,mr. long
614,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Mr. President, last year, Democrats and Republicans joined together with President Bush to enact a monumental and far-reaching education bill.This new law, the Leave No Child Behind Act, will bring new resources and meaningful reform to our Nation's schools.It establishes new academic standards for students, increases teacher training, and demands new levels of accountability, while increasing flexibility with Federal funds at the State and local level.I am hopeful that this law will help close the achievement gaps that separate many poor and minority students from their peers.Indeed, I am optimistic that it will improve education for all students.But Congress has, as Harry Truman once said, some ``unfinished business' when it comes to our schools.We have left out a critical component when it comes to ensuring that our schools and our teachers and, most importantly, our students will succeed.Today, one in five schools fails to meet building or safety codes or needs extensive repairs, renovations, and maintenance.Across the country, run-down, overcrowded, dilapidated schools jeopardize the health and safety of our students.Across the country, deteriorating schools inhibit the ability of our children to learn.And yet, with the exception of the Impact Aid program, which I strongly support, the new education reform law did not include funds for school renovation and repair.Nor were any funds for renovation and repair made available through the appropriations process.The administration's most recent budget even eliminates the Emergency School Repair Program.And yet, data from the National Center for Education Statistics tells us that nearly $127 billion in renovations and repairs are needed to upgrade existing schools to good physical condition.Furthermore, this figure does not include the funding needed for construction to accommodate increasing enrollments in districts across the country.We have these pressing needs at a time when resources are scarce. Our States and local governments are still feeling the effects of the recession.And for too many years, Congress has failed to provide States and localities the funding it promised long ago to share the cost of special education.The Federal Government cannot ask States and localities to shoulder the burden of school renovation and repair costs alone.If the Federal Government stands on the sidelines, it will be at the expense of our children.But neither should Washington attempt to single-handedly solve this problem. Congress should not be in the business of giving direct grants to communities to build schools.I strongly believe that education is a national priority but a local responsibility.The legislation being introduced today, the ``Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act,'' answers this call for partnership.Our bill provides initial funding for the creation of State and regional infrastructure banks. These banks will make loans to districts for school construction or modernization needs.This mechanism helps to alleviate the financial burden for States and localities but provides sufficient flexibility to meet local needs.The structure of the bill ensures that states and localities have the requisite flexibility to tailor programs to meet their unique needs.The bill requires a 25 percent State match, which ensures the commitment of State government to the program while allowing States to leverage their dollars four-to-one.It is a voluntary program--only for those states who choose to participate.To those who have argued that the Federal Government should have no role in school facilities, and likewise to those who call for overly intrusive Federal programs, this bill offers a common-sense compromise.I remember visiting a school in Nixa, MO, where every fourth-grader in the district attends class in trailers behind the school.I have subsequently learned from teachers and administrators in other districts that the kids in trailers often have the best deal because conditions in the actual school buildings are often far worse than they are in the trailers.Every State in this country has districts in need, in both urban and rural and suburban communities. The needs span the social economic strata of our Nation.Disadvantaged and minority students are most likely to attend school in decrepit and obsolete buildings.I would imagine that we have all seen schools that are either freezing cold or unbearably hot, that have poor lighting or inadequate bathroom facilities.But students in more affluent suburbs--where there is often explosive growth in the community--also suffer from overcrowding.Most parents would agree that they would like their children to attend schools where the student to teacher ratio is low, where class size is small.Yet, without enough space, small class size is an impossibility.And despite these conditions, we are asking our children for more than ever before.A fellow Missourian, Mark Twain, once told the following story:When I was a boy on the Mississippi River there was a proposition in a township there to discontinue public schools because they were too expensive. An old farmer spoke up and said, ``If they stopped building the schools they would not save anything, because every time a school was closed a jail had to be built.''I have great faith in America's children. The time to invest in them is now. The investments we make in them will be returned to us many times over.,2015-03-16 18:17:27.800879,2015-03-16 18:17:27.800879,Senate,LEAVE NO CHILD BEHIND ACT,2002-04-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-04-18/html/CREC-2002-04-18-pt1-PgS2910-2.htm,44,0,148,S2910-S2911,C001043,mrs. carnahan
615,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Madam President, all across our Nation, local schools are trying to ensure that tragedies like the one in Littleton do not happen again.The Federal Government in Washington is not in a position to make the best decisions for those local schools. No government--let alone the Federal Government--can produce a single solution, to prevent school violence.The problems have deeper roots in our culture. Nonetheless, there are some important steps we can take to help local school districts and parents make schools safer.In a few moments, I will send to the desk an amendment on behalf of Members of the Youth Violence Education task force, a task force which I helped Chair, that will help ensure that our schools once again become safe havens, rather than places of jeopardy. I thank those who came together on this task force to contribute to the amendment. Specifically, Senators Hutchinson, DeWine, Gregg, Helms, Coverdell, Allard, and Abraham.This package is comprehensive in that it contains numerous provisions that give tools to schools and communities to prevent youth violence. First and foremost, we need to put local schools at the top of our agenda and free them to use Federal money where it will do the most good to prevent future violence. Time and experience have exposed as an utter falsehood the notion that we know what is best in every educational setting.One-size-fits-all regulations won't help local schools reduce their particular risks or solve their unique problems. As we provide resources, we need to provide freedom.The cornerstone of our education amendment would open up existing Department of Education funds to allow school districts new options for putting Federal dollars to work. Under this amendment, schools can choose where best to spend Federal resources under titles IV and VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--specifically, the Safe and Drug Free Schools program, and Innovative Educational Program Strategies funds.Schools can decide whether to spend the money on training, equipment, school assessments, or more personnel. For example, under this amendment, local school districts could use Federal money for purchasing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, for training school officials in recognizing and averting potentially dangerous situations, or for introducing school uniform policies, if they so chose.Local school districts would remain free to choose the use that best addresses local needs. The Federal Government provides a great deal of money for education and related funding. The fiscal year 2000 budget resolution conference report called for $66.3 billion in education and related funding for fiscal year 2000; $404.1 billion over 5 years; and $782.4 billion over 10 years.Compared to current spending levels, this represents an increase of $8.1 billion over 5 years and $33 billion over 10 years.As a result of this budget resolution, Congress will be providing much-needed funding to education programs in fiscal year 2000. While we know that local schools need our help, we do not always know how best to provide that help. We need to provide the opportunity and authority for local schools to do what they can to improve the climate for safe and secure learning environments on campuses. For this reason, this amendment will give schools the flexibility they need to best provide for the safety and security of their students.Another component of this amendment would clarify that nothing in the Federal law stands in the way of local decisions to introduce a dress code or school uniform policy--not to mandate from Washington, but make it clear that the Federal law does not prevent it or preclude it. To make sure that we don't constrain efforts to build working communities, this legislation makes it abundantly clear that Federal law does not prohibit schools from instituting dress codes. Dress codes can create a sense of belonging and unity among students and help eliminate the division of schools according to cliques. By doing so, dress codes can help schools have a sense of community among students, and Federal law should not block local educators from fostering this sense of community.In Kansas City, MO, the George Washington Carver Elementary School, a magnet school, established a dress code policy for the 320 elementary school students in 1990. The results are positive. Philomina Harshaw, the principal for all 6 years that Carver has had uniforms, observed that a new sense of calmness exists throughout the school after students began wearing uniforms. ``The students feel good about themselves, as uniforms build a sense of pride,'' she has reported.Long Beach, CA, has a school uniform in all its elementary and middle schools. District officials found in the year following the implementation of the school uniform policy, overall school crime decreased 36 percent, fights decreased 51 percent, sex offenses decreased 74 percent, weapons offenses decreased 50 percent, assault and battery offenses decreased 34 percent, and vandalism decreased 18 percent, sending a clear message that some of the resources which can be used to implement such a policy is sending a clear message of freedom to our schools that they are free to act in the best interests of their students.The federal government should be in a position to assist schools in making decisions that they believe can make a difference, particularly when the record is clear about the difference made in other districts.In addition, this task force, which was formed to look at our federal education policy to see if anything could be done to reduce the impact of violence in schools, included in the amendment a provision which provides certain liability protections for school personnel when they undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline, and a safe educational environment.This provision, to which Senator Coverdell will speak shortly, is based upon similar liability protections for volunteers that was signed into law, as well as a number of state laws that offer teachers limited civil liability against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits. We must assure that teachers and other school personnel are able to do what is necessary to provide a safe and stable learning environment for all students.This amendment also includes language that makes certain that school discipline records follow a student when a student transfers to another public or private school.The receiving school should have information about the discipline records of a student coming into that school environment. In the last Congress I sponsored an amendment that ensured that juvenile records were available to schools when students transferred.My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of 15-year-old Christine Smetzer in a restroom at McCluer North High School in St. Louis County. The male special education student convicted of murdering Smetzer had a juvenile record and had been caught in the women's restroom at a previous school. However, teachers and administrators at McCluer North say they were not informed of the student's record when he transferred to their school.It was tragic the transfer didn't involve the disciplinary records, because it cost Christine Smetzer her life.In response, I secured a provision in the law requiring that, under IDEA, student disciplinary records must transfer to a new school when the student goes to a new school.The language in the task force amendment expands that provision, so that any student's discipline record--whether or not the student is served under IDEA--will be available to any school--public or private--to which the student transfers.We need to send all the information we can about a student to a new school when a person transfers.These provisions and others were developed by the Republican Education Task Force which I chaired. I want to again thank my colleagues who worked with me on the Task Force--Senators DeWine and Hutchinson, Gregg, Coverdell, and Helms. I look forward to working with them to ensure that these proposals are included in the final bill.It is in response to these considerations. As a result of the work product of this task force, we developed a package of considerations in an amendment.I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.,2015-03-16 18:17:27.991016,2015-03-16 18:17:27.991016,Senate,VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF 1999,1999-05-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-05-17/html/CREC-1999-05-17-pt1-PgS5394-3.htm,71,193,145,S5394-S5416,A000356,mr. ashcroft
616,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support to Absentee Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Voters Act of 2001. This bill ensures that Americans serving overseas, be they the men and women of the military who stand guard on foreign shares, or equally deserving citizens who serve our country in other venues, will have their vote counted. American citizens should not loose their right to vote under arbitrary or unfair standards. It is therefore incumbent upon lawmakers to ensure their rights are protected.Although overseas mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark, the reality of the situation is that circumstances in foreign countries, or at sea aboard u.S. Navy ships, can result in mail being sent without a postmark. Currently several states require a postmark for an absentee ballot to be counted and without such a postmark citizens are denied their vote through absolutely no fault of their own. We saw the damaging affects of this standard in our most recent Presidential election.My bill provides that states may not refuse to count a ballot submitted in an election for a Federal office by an absentee uniformed services member or overseas citizen voter on the grounds that the ballot was improperly or fraudulently cast ``unless the State finds clear and convincing evidence'' of fraud in the preparation or casting of the ballot by the voter. Specifically, the bill states under a ``Clear and Convincing Evidence'' standard, the lack of a witness signature, address, postmark, or other identifying information may not be considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud, absent any other information or evidence. Consequently the mere absence of a postmark will not disqualify an overseas citizen from casting his or her vote. By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dodd):S. 471. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for the renovation of schools; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.Mr. President, today we will be introducing the Public School Repair and Renovation Act. This legislation will provide grants to local schools so they can make the repairs to ensure the safety of their students. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bingaman, Kennedy, Wellsone, Dodd, and Clinton on this legislation.In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a Report Card for America's Infrastructure which reported serious problems with the physical infrastructure in our nation. However, the most alarming finding is the failing grade to schools in the United States--the only area to receive a failing grade.It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our kids see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown place they see is their school. What signal are we sending them about the value we place on them, their education and future?Modernizing and repairing our nation's schools is something I've been advocating for over a decade now. I secured $100 million in the fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill as a down payment on a school modernization program and was disappointed when those funds were rescinded.But we made real progress last year with the passage of a $1.2 billion initiative to make emergency repairs. That was a bipartisan agreement hammered out by Senator Specter and me in negotiations on the fiscal year 2001 appropriations bill with Congressman Goodling and the White House.This was a 1 year authorization and the School Repair and Renovation Act will reauthorize this bipartisan plan for 5 years. This program provides grants to Local Education Agencies to help them make urgently needed repairs and to pay for special education and construction related technology expenses.Funds will be distributed to the States. States will then distribute 75 percent of the funds on a competitive basis to local school districts to make emergency repairs such as fixing fire code violation, repairing the roof or installing new plumbing. The remaining 25 percent will be distributed competitively to local school districts to use for technology activities related to school renovation or for activities authorized under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.The School Repair and Renovation Act is a key component in a two-prong strategy to modernize our nation's schools.In the near future I will join forces with Representatives Johnson and Rangel and introduce the America's Better Classrooms Act in the Senate to provide tax credits for school construction projects. This bipartisan legislation would leverage $1.7 billion in tax credits over 5 years to pay the interest on $25 billion in school modernization bonds.I know this approach will work because it mirrors a successful school construction demonstration program I started in Iowa in 1997. The Iowa demonstration is a two-prong response to our school modernization needs. First, we provide grants to local school districts to make urgent repairs to remedy fire code violations. Second, grants are made to local school districts to subsidize a portion of the cost for a new construction project.The program has been a big success. During the first 2 years of the demonstration, federal funds of $14.7 million supported projects totaling $142 million--each federal dollar leveraged $10.33.There is a legitimate federal role in helping fix our nation's crumbling schools, and we can do so without undermining local control of education. This federal role is recognized by President Bush who is recommending an expanded use of private activity bonds for school construction projects.Over the past few years we have had several partisan skirmishes related to school construction. This is a new year, a new Congress, and a new administration. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the School Repair and Renovation Act of 2001. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the report card to which I referred be printed in the Record.There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:TrillionA = ExceptionB = GoodC = MediocreD = PoorF = IndequateEach category was evaluated on the basis of condition and performance,capacity vs. need, and funding vs. need.,2015-03-16 18:17:28.200192,2015-03-16 18:17:28.200192,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2001-03-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-03-06/html/CREC-2001-03-06-pt1-PgS1898.htm,28,17,147,S1898-S1910,B000611,mr. bond
617,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank the acting manager. I thank the Chair.I want to talk about an amendment that I introduced some time ago and which we will vote on later this afternoon. The amendment itself is not very difficult and not very complex. It doesn't have a major change. But it represents a watershed development in education. Parents for a long time have marveled at how fast their children learn when they are very young and how they pick up things--not just things off the floor but how they learn language and how they learn many other things.Research has verified what all of us have known instinctively for a long time--that the first years of life are absolutely crucial in the development of a child's intelligence, habits, and the entire approach to life. The early years have a significant bearing on development and especially on the learning of each child. Infant brain development occurs very rapidly. The sensations and experiences of this time go a very long way towards shaping the baby's mind in a way that has a long-lasting impact on all aspects of the child's life.You can think, if you have been a parent, or if you are parents, about how fast they learn in the first 3 years. A baby learns to walk, to talk, and to interact with others.As a matter of fact, an astounding figure I heard was that half a child's mature intelligence is developed by 3 years of age. During those first 3 years that a child learns, it absorbs so much that it is half of what he or she is going to know for the rest of their life.The early months of growth, understanding, reasoning, and learning can never be brought back or redone again. Once they are gone, they are gone. The early years of a child's development are not just rehearsal. That is the whole show. That is the opening act. That sets the stage and the pace of their entire life's path.Parents and families are key to the early development of a child. Through the amendment that I offer today, we seek to focus on support of parents and family education for young children.This amendment provides a clarification to title VI, part A of the substitute. It simply states that early childhood and early childhood parent education are eligible for funding and that early childhood means zero, or birth, to 5 years of age. The amendment is no new money, and it doesn't authorize any new program.People think learning begins at kindergarten. By kindergarten children are halfway through their learning process in their entire life. Who best to teach that child in the first 3 formative years than the parents? We must focus on the early years of a child's life as well as on the years of formal schooling. We can emphasize and champion this early involvement.My amendment proposes to do just that by supporting successful early childhood programs and initiatives that are working at local and State levels throughout this country.We spend so much time talking about how to improve our public schools, which we must do, and this bill attempts to do that. We talk about improving school performance for students, reducing violence in schools, and all of that we must do. But I think we can reduce the amount of time we spend trying to fix, repair, and cure these problems if we get the job done right at the first stage.A key to this successful prevention is parental involvement at the time most essential in the child's development. The organization, which in my State of Missouri has been doing an outstanding job--and it is being done nationwide--is something called Parents as Teachers. I will refer to it as PAT.It is an early childhood education program and family support program designed to empower all parents, regardless of their income levels, to give their child the best possible start in life. PAT is now in all 50 States and 6 foreign countries.My involvement with Parents as Teachers began in 1979. Then commissioner of elementary and secondary education, Arthur Mallory, who worked for me the previous term when I had been Governor, came to talk to me about a very interesting and challenging program they had begun based on the work of some of the researchers and scholars who had looked at the Head Start Program. He said they were finding out that what a parent does in those first 3 years was vitally important as they stimulate the child's learning intelligence. Curiosity is the basis of it. That was 1979.I started talking about that and ran a successful campaign for Governor in 1980. In 1981, our first son was born. You talk about an old dog trying to learn new tricks. I had just bought a new car, and they gave me a manual about that thick of what to do with the new car. We came home from the hospital with a new baby. They gave us a supply of diapers and told us to be sure to use a child's seat. I said that is a little bit mistaken as to the emphasis we ought to put on preparing children and making sure that parents are ready for the challenge of raising a child.We had, fortunately, access to many initiatives that had been developed in this program, The program was not statewide at the time. It was, in fact, in the initial stages. The scholars, including Dr. Burton White, had written several thoughtful books. We read those books. We learned from them what was supposed to be happening. The interesting thing was it made it a lot easier for us to work with our son to understand what he was doing.I recommended it to the Missouri General Assembly. They did not pass it in 1981. They didn't pass it in 1982. They did not pass it in 1983. But being stubborn, I came back in 1984, and we pointed out to them that this not only prepared the child for learning--my director of corrections came before the committee giving testimony on the bill and said this was the most important thing we could do for the long-term future of our State: reduce the population of our corrections system by getting parents involved and making sure that children were off to a good learning start; making sure that parents were responsible for their children.In 1982, I set up something called the Children's Trust Fund Commission to help reduce child abuse. We had 25 eminent children's leaders from the ministry, education, and health around the State who studied how to prevent child abuse. They came back in 1984 with the unanimous recommendation to adopt Parents as Teachers to help the families know how to deal with the challenges of raising a child.I have always had a theory that if you have a toddler in your house, at some point if that toddler doesn't drive you absolutely nuts, either, A, the toddler is not normal, or, B, you are not normal. Parents as Teachers can teach how you can constructively use that curiosity, that enthusiasm, and that burgeoning intelligence and shift it in the right direction.Fortunately, after a bit of cajoling, a little wheeling and dealing, and a few side deals that I will not mention here, the Missouri General Assembly adopted Parents as Teaches as the statewide program in 1984.It has gone statewide. Each year it is a voluntary participation program, available in all 500-plus school districts in Missouri. And 150,000 families, with 200,000 children, participate in the program. Now the program is working throughout the country. The State of Tennessee has 20 program sites, Massachusetts has 7 program sites, Nevada has 13 program sites, Mississippi has 32 program sites, South Dakota has 20 Parents as Teachers Program sites; our neighbors in Kansas have 222 program sites; Illinois has 132 program sites.As I said, PAT is a voluntary participation program. It is tailored to empower parents to know how to deal constructively with their children. Sometimes it is included as part of Even Start, another title 1 program. PAT and Head Start in Missouri have a great partnership to ensure that all children get off to a great start.Some said at the beginning, why, this is a good program for people on Medicaid or people on TANF, and other programs. And that is true. But it is a program that works for every family, the so-called ``successful'' family, with two working parents--two professionals, working full time, who never have enough time for their families. But with this program they know how to use that time constructively.As a father, I never looked forward to playing the typical father role, which is where somebody says: If you don't behave, when your father gets home, you're really going to get it. I did not intend to be a father so I could be the one to bring out the hairbrush. There was a paddle when I got home. But Parents as Teachers taught me what I could do constructively to help my child be more curious and begin the learning process.Studies and reports have shown that PAT children at age 3 are significantly more advanced than the comparison children in language, problem solving, and social development. Often, through participation in PAT, learning problems or developmental delays or disabilities are identified and treated early.This is one of the great things. They have screening in the program, and they identify minor hearing defects which can, if not corrected, put a child behind as much as a year by the time that child reaches first grade.I had an eyesight problem when I was little. It wasn't identified until I was in the sixth grade. It was too late to help it then. Each year the program has been in effect, they have identified that eye problem; they have been able to correct it because they identified it before the child reached 2 years of age.Some people, when opposing Parents as Teachers, say it is subversive; that the Government is trying to come in and take over the children. The Government is not trying to come in and take over the children. But there is a subversive element that I have learned; that is, once you teach a parent how to do a better job with the child's learning intelligence, you get that parent hooked on the child's education. A parent goes in thinking: Gee, this will help me control my child. The parent comes out being involved, supporting and participating in the child's education. And most people will tell you that the most important thing a parent can do is to stay involved with the child's education.We all know we can have all the programs in the world and can provide all the funding possible, but one of the main ingredients on which we must focus to assure a child's success in school is parental involvement.Earlier this year I received a copy of a report from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report was entitled ``School Entry Assessment Project.'' Some of the findings really piqued my interest.The findings of the report are as follows:No. 1, when Parents as Teachers is combined with any other prekindergarten experience for high-poverty children, the children score above average on all scales when they enter kindergarten.No. 2, the highest performing children participate in PAT and preschool or center care. Among children who participate in PAT and attend preschool, both minority and nonminority children score above average. Children in both high-poverty and low-poverty schools who participate in PAT and attend preschool score above average when they enter kindergarten.No. 3, among children whose care and education are solely home-based, those whose families participate in PAT score significantly higher.No. 4, special needs children who participate in PAT and preschool, in addition to an early childhood special education program, are rated by teachers as being similar in preparation to the average child.Finally, Head Start children who also participate in PAT and other preschool activities score at average or above when they enter kindergarten.These findings sum it all up. PAT works. PAT works for children raised in households of all income levels. PAT works for children who are homeschooled, children who have special needs.My amendment, which I urge my colleagues to support, makes certain that priority is given to programs such as PAT and other early childhood and parent education programs.I thank the Chair.,2015-03-16 18:17:28.328256,2015-03-16 18:17:28.328256,Senate,BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT,2001-06-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-06-11/html/CREC-2001-06-11-pt1-PgS6023-2.htm,80,10,147,S6023-S6050,B000611,mr. bond
618,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, our families are struggling in the worst economy since the Great Depression. It is a difficult time for many who do not have jobs or who have seen their savings shrink or are in danger of losing their homes. We are working very hard on many fronts to try to get the economy going again.During this time, I think it is important we not lose sight of our long-term priorities. We have to build a better safety net for our children and families. We must think about the long-term educational prospects and tools for success our children need, regardless of the economy.Today, I highlight two bills that address educational needs of children.First, research tells us that the first months and years of life are critical in laying the foundation for later success in school and social interaction. As a matter of fact, some people say that half of a child's learning intelligence is developed by 3 years old. For too long, we have thought those wonderful little people under 3 were just to be loved and ignored in terms of education. Much of the time is spent in the home, and parents are the most influential part of a child's life. It is my view that they must be the child's best first teacher. During these early moments, with the parents and other family members, children establish their social, emotional and intellectual health that will continue to grow throughout their lives. Enhancing these early critical moments further enhances the later years of a child's education.You know, the key to education is exciting their curiosity. If you can make a child curious, then you can begin to teach them because you can respond to what their curiosity seeks. I think it makes sense to equip the parents with the skills they need to help maximize the child's health and development. This is exactly what a program that I have worked on in Missouri does. It is called Parents as Teachers--or PAT--and that is precisely what it focuses on. It focuses on primarily those first 3 years of life, when half the learning intelligence, when the socialization and interaction are developing, and when the curiosity is excited.The curriculum of PAT is designed to build a foundation for later learning, to provide early detection of developmental delays, as well as health, vision, and hearing problems, to prevent child abuse and neglect and to increase a child's school readiness and success.Actually, we found that detecting those early childhood developmental delays probably saves more money in avoiding special education or remedial education needs later on. The way we finally got the bill passed in the Missouri General Assembly was when a commission I had set up as Governor studied ways to lessen child abuse. They came back and said: You know, the best thing you can do is to equip a parent with the tools to deal with a child's frustration and keep them from pushing you to the point where you are abusive.My Bond theorem is that if you have a 2-year-old child and that child isn't driving you nuts on a regular basis, either, A, you are not normal or, B, the child is not normal. Parents as Teachers gives the parent a means of dealing with those frustrating and challenging times.Twenty-five years ago, I pushed the Early Childhood Education Act through the Missouri General Assembly and signed it into law. It was my second term and I had to fight for 4 years to get the bill passed, but it mandates that Parents as Teachers be offered in every school district in the State. In other words, to every family; whether they were going to home school their children, whether they had their children at parochial or private school or in a public school.That was 4 long years of work, and I don't know that I have ever had a more satisfying 4-year-long battle with that success. I was on a mission because the year I started pushing it was the year my son was born. I was anxious to be a new father and shared the same feelings of anxiety and confusion many new parents still feel today. I had bought a new car before my son arrived, and it came with a handbook. We took Sam home from the hospital, and they told us to use a car seat and gave us diapers. Well, children's schooling is a key component of a child's success in school, and that is why we began working on it.PAT made a positive difference in my family, through sleepless nights, teething, and learning the ABCs. My son was probably one of the first to benefit from the Parents as Teachers materials and books, but countless others have benefited since. And after I passed it, I found that parents would stop me on the street or in my office and say: You would not believe what I learned when the parent educator came to visit us. Every time it was something new and different and it gave the parents a feeling of power that they could deal with the opportunities this new child gave them.What began as an experiment in Missouri has expanded to more than 3,000 sites in all 50 States and 8 foreign countries. Countries all over the world are investing in PAT because the results are positive and the cost is low. We have about 150,000 Missouri families--200,000 children--participating in PAT now. I have had the anecdotal results, but scientifically we have determined, through sound research, that at age 3, PAT children are more advanced in language, social development, problem solving, and other cognitive abilities than their peers; and parents who participate in PAT are more confident about their parenting and more involved in the children's schooling, which is a key component of a child's success in school.I can tell you also that when you talk to an elementary school educator or administrator they can tell you which children have been in the Parents as Teachers program because it is that obvious from the start. A 2008 published, peer-reviewed study of almost 8,000 Missouri children found that 82 percent of low-income children who participated in both Parents as Teachers and preschool entered kindergarten ready to learn, as compared to only 64 percent of similar children who had no involvement in either service.At third grade, 88 percent of low-income children who participated in both Parents as Teachers and preschool received a benchmark level of performance on the Missouri Assessment Program Communication Arts test, compared to 77 percent of similar children with no involvement.These results confirm what I know from personal experience and have heard from so many parents in PAT--it is a tremendous benefit to them and their children.To date, more than 2 million families nationwide have received the education and support of PAT programs. These are accomplishments of which we can be proud, but we need to do more. There are more families that can and should be reached by this life-changing program, which is why I have introduced the Education Begins at Home Act with Senators Murray and Clinton. This legislation will establish the first dedicated Federal funding stream to support the expansion of PAT.Our bill has had strong bipartisan support in the past, and I expect it will continue. It would authorize $400 million over 3 years to States to expand access to Parents as Teachers. It would provide $50 million over 3 years to fund innovative ideas and partnerships at the local level to expand access to PAT in communities with limited English proficiency, and it would provide $50 million over 3 years to reach more military families by expanding access to PAT in schools and community organizations that serve military families.As a side note, we have established the program at several military facilities in Missouri where one parent is often gone overseas, and the family may not have any normal family network to help them. This brings the parents together and it also provides them some of the resources that they might get from a grandmother or an aunt or even an uncle.Parents as Teachers builds on the principle that babies are born to learn and that the child's parent is the first and most important teacher. PAT gives parents the tools they need to prepare children for success in school and life, and helps parents become more active participants in their child's education. I believe the expansion of Parents as Teachers is a sound investment in the future of our children and our families, and I hope my colleagues will join me in it.I, also, wish to add comments about another extremely important act to ensure the success of children--the Vision Care for Kids Act. Eighty percent of what kids learn in their early years is visual, but one in four children has a vision problem that can interfere with learning, and only one in three children receive any form of preventive vision care before school.As I said, children have tremendous potential to learn and succeed, but untreated vision disorders can lead to permanent vision loss. I know that, personally, because I suffer from a permanent vision loss due to a previously undiagnosed condition which wasn't learned about until it was too late. If the condition had been discovered and treated before I entered school, I could have avoided a lifetime of vision loss--and I might have done a much better job of catching fly balls in the outfield.The Vision Care for Kids Act, which I have reintroduced with Senator Dodd, establishes a grant program to complement and encourage existing State efforts to improve children's vision care. Ensuring good vision for kids will help them see bright futures ahead of them. I invite my colleagues to join us in supporting children and families through these important bills.For the vision care, talk with Senator Dodd or me. For Parents as Teachers, talk with Senator Murray or me. We would love to have you on these two important bills.I thank the Chair and I thank the staff for according me this opportunity.,2015-03-16 18:17:28.477362,2015-03-16 18:17:28.477362,Senate,EDUCATION BEGINS AT HOME ACT,2009-01-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-16/html/CREC-2009-01-16-pt1-PgS647.htm,10,0,155,S647-S648,B000611,mr. bond
619,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Slaughter-Dicks amendment.Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Slaughter-Dicks-Horn-Johnson-Morella amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill to give the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) additional appropriations of $10 million and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) an additional $5 million. The value of the NEA lies in its ability to nurture the growth and artistic excellence of thousands of arts organizations and artists in every corner of the country, making the performing, visual, literary, media and folk arts available to millions of Americans.Even in this time of fiscal restraint and budget deficits, the value of the NEA cannot be overstated. Additional appropriations are still required, as the NEA is a great investment in the economic growth of every community in the country. A recent study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology found that the nonprofit arts industry alone generates $134 billion annually in economic activity, supports 4.85 million full time jobs and returns $10.5 billion to the Federal Government in income taxes. While the economic benefit of the arts industry is integral to our Nation's economy, affording children access to the arts through education yields more significant dividends to our society. The U.S. Department of Justice found that arts education reduced delinquency in San Antonio by 13 percent, increased communication skills of Atlanta students by 57 percent, and improved cooperation skills of Portland youth by 57 percent. In addition, the College Board has shown that college bound students who are involved in the arts have higher overall SAT scores than other students.The National Endowment for the Humanities is the largest single funder of humanities programs in the United States, enriching American intellectual and cultural life through support to museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, state humanities councils, public television and radio, and to individual scholars. A small investment through NEH reaps large rewards, providing seed money for high quality projects and programs that reach millions of Americans each year. This money, and NEH's reputation, leverage millions of dollars in private support for humanities projects. NEH is critical to addressing the Nation's future needs in education. More than two-thirds of our Nation's K-12 curriculum is dedicated to the humanities; 2 million new teachers will be needed in our classrooms over the next decade, and 4 out of 5 teachers feel inadequately prepared in their subject area. NEH summer seminars and institutes address these very issues, and are the catalyst for revitalized teachers for tens of thousands of students each year.America's creative industries are our Nation's leading export with over $60 billion annually in overseas sales, including the output of artists and other creative workers in publishing, audiovisual, music and recording and entertainment businesses.The National Endowment for the Humanities plays an important role in the American arts enterprise. NEH grants provide critical funding for work in art history, theory and criticism, including: university based and independent research projects; professional development seminars for K-12 and college teachers; film and radio programs; museum exhibitions and exhibition catalogs; and material culture preservation.In my home state of Missouri, our Humanities Council currently is planning an array of public programs for distribution in Missouri during the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition, 2003 through 2006. The planning is supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Missouri Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission. The NEH planning grant supporting these trial programs is intended to produce program templates that can be deployed successfully with local participation by Native American spokespersons in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, serving communities within a day-trip's distance of the Missouri River. These programs will provide Missouri youth an important lesson in American history in an entertaining environment.Mr. Chairman, I commend all arts advocates today on their continued dedication to arts in education. I strongly urge for increased resources for arts education in this year's appropriations process.,2015-03-16 18:17:28.699525,2015-03-16 18:17:28.699525,House,DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2003,2002-07-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-07-17/html/CREC-2002-07-17-pt1-PgH4773-3.htm,97,214,148,H4773-H4819,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
620,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,In addition, and that is so critically important, what a popular idea that is in place in your State and in other States as far as prepaid State tuition plans, to be used again as a tool focusing on higher education.Here are a couple of other perhaps noncontroversial measures in H.R. 7 that I think deserve some mention in addition to the prepaid tuition plans, ending that taxation on both public and private plans. We also help those that are saddled with heavy student loans. How many of us in this body perhaps have used student loans to invest in ourselves in education to maybe go on to higher education or to postgraduate studies. What we do to try to give some relief to those under that heavy burden of student loans is that we continue, we expand the student deduction, the loan interest deduction under current law, we expand that, allow more time for that deduction to be made possible.In addition, there is a lot of discussion about school construction. Interestingly as we debated this bill in our committee, in the Committee on Ways and Means last week, we had a representative from the U.S. Treasury, obviously from the administration, and I pointed out in a document that was printed in 1996 that the statement of the administration was they believed the construction of schools is a local initiative. Yet I guess over the course of the last couple of years, we have suddenly changed or at least the White House has changed into thinking that suddenly school construction and modernization should be a Federal initiative. Without getting into the merits of whether it is a State, and I happen to think it is a State and local initiative, in fact in my home county, Boone County, Missouri in the Ninth Congressional District on the April ballot, we will be going to the polls to decide a bond issue as it appropriately should be done at the local level.But what we also do is provide in this bill relief from some of the complicated rules called bond arbitrage rules that both States and localities use when they make that decision, when they go to the local voters and decide whether to renovate or to build or modernize their school structures, we provide some relief for them. That is also in this bill. Finally, we encourage the private sector to donate computers to schools. And so we have that provision in H.R. 7, as well. Probably not as controversial as some of the other things we have discussed.As a final point, and I see we have got one of our other classmates here, then I will yield to the two of you. You mentioned the policy, and I want to talk about the policy, about using the Tax Code for certain incentives. Let me tell you why I think that it is just good policy generally to encourage savings. Right now, and for those, Mr. Speaker, that may be wrestling with their 1040 forms and maybe have C-SPAN on in the background, if you look at your 1040 form on line 8A and line 8B, you plug into, as far as part of your taxable income, your adjusted gross income, any interest you may have earned, whether on a certificate of deposit, whether it is on a savings account, the old traditional savings account or any dividends you receive, you have to add that obviously to your taxable income according to current law and Uncle Sam wants his share.There is no wonder that we are the lowest savings Nation among industrialized countries. We have already precedent in existing law. We encourage people to put aside money after tax dollars for their retirement, with the Roth IRA, a very popular idea. That is, one puts aside one's after-tax dollars, it accumulates interest or earnings, and then it is not taxed when used for retirement.We had a provision that we sent to the President called the SAFE Act that would shield about the first $500 of interest or dividend income again, to help the small or moderate investor, not the Wall Street types that make a living at investment, but really trying to help middle-class families.Along that line, this education savings account, I think, falls right in that good tax policy, and that is trying to provide this incentive to encourage people, especially families, to plug away more money, whether it is putting nickels and dimes or a monthly set-aside from their paycheck into an education savings account for their child or children. Again, what could be more of a worthy exercise than to invest in your own children's future, not rely upon the Federal Government?Again, I commend the gentlewoman for bringing this issue to the attention of the full House. I look forward to the debate. I hope we can have the debate on policy; and I hope the rhetoric does not get too harsh or hot, although that may be asking for a lot; but nonetheless, I urge, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues to support H.R. 7 when it gets to the floor. I thank my friend for yielding me time this evening.,2015-03-16 18:17:28.873647,2015-03-16 18:17:28.873647,House,EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,2000-03-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-03-28/html/CREC-2000-03-28-pt1-PgH1455-4.htm,36,6,146,H1455-H1461,H000948,mr. hulshof
621,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, the Republican leadership has once again succeeded in bringing to the floor a Labor, Health and Education Appropriations bill designed to please only themselves and their right-wing friends. H.R. 4577 fails to make needed investments in public education and the domestic workforce, and, as the result, would undermine American competitiveness in the 21st century. This bill has already received what has now become its customary and well-deserved veto threat from the Clinton administration. It is clearly going nowhere, and should be soundly defeated.This bill was doomed from its inception, because the economic premise upon which it is based is flawed. Earlier this year, before the appropriations process began, the Republican leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich. They attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution. This decision to squander the surplus, rather than invest it, severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our Nation's critical needs.Overall, the bill provides $2.9 billion less than the President request for the Department of Education, and $1.7 billion less for the Department of Labor. As the result, education, job training, workplace safety, and other programs are either frozen or cut, significantly reducing the level of services that can be provided.For example, the bill would slash Title I funding, forcing school districts to cut back on assistance to disadvantaged students. The Clinton/Clay class size reduction initiative is gutted, leaving school districts without the resources to hire and train 20,000 more top-quality teachers. Adequate funding is denied for after-school and summer programs intended to improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime. And no funds are provided to renovate crumbling and unsafe schools.At the same time efforts are ongoing in the Congress to erase limits on the immigration of foreign workers to fill high-tech jobs, this bill would make steep cuts in the funding of training programs aimed at helping domestic workers fill them and other positions. Dislocated workers and at-risk youth are particularly hard hit by these cuts, even though they are the ones most in need of skills training. By failing to adequately invest in our own workforce, the Republican leadership is jeopardizing American competitiveness and prosperity.This bill also jeopardizes worker health and safety by shortchanging OSHA and blocking issuance of the ergonomics rule intended to prevent about 300,000 workplace injuries a year. The Wilson amendment would add insult to injury by cutting $25 million more from OSHA.Mr. Chairman, this appropriation bill is a disaster. It fails to adequately invest in education, and in the development and security of the Nation's workforce. I urge a no vote on H.R. 4577.The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time has expired.

622,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this continuing resolution, our twelfth in 5 weeks, to keep the government operating; but I deeply regret that we have reached this point and I am deeply disappointed by what has happened to America's education priorities in the last 72 hours.On Sunday night, after 3 days of no negotiations, Republicans met face-to-face with Democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education. Democrats asked Republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered, yes. In an example of bipartisan compromise, both sides came together and both sides sought common ground. Negotiators toiled late into the evening. Each side made concessions, as must be done in a bipartisan compromise, and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue. I give great credit to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), and I give great credit to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), and the Senators who were involved. The bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country. This bill included full funding for 100,000 new teachers, teacher training, after-school programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization.Less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached, the leaders of the Republican Party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby.The Republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who, according to the Washington Post, were making, and I quote, ``urgent calls to the Hill to try to block this compromise,'' simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries. This Republican-led Congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes, so that our children could be better educated.Mr. Speaker, I guess it is not a surprise, because Republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating America's agenda, a bipartisan agenda, by giving in to special interests. On every one of these issues, the Republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over America's agenda.We tried to get an affordable, effective prescription medicine program; we forced it on to the agenda with the help of Republican members, and it was scuttled in conference; and it is not going anywhere, because I guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it.We worked with Republicans to force on to the agenda of this House an effective and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights, and it has been stifled in a conference committee because I guess the insurance companies did not want it.We could have had targeted tax cuts for college and long-term care and child care, but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done.We fought for sensible gun safety legislation, but it is stifled in a conference committee, I guess as a favor to the National Rifle Association.We have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage; but it too is stifled, even though it has strong bipartisan support.We forced on to the agenda of this House campaign finance reform, which is desperately desired by the people of this country, and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this House, and it has been stifled in a conference committee.There is a pattern here, Mr. Speaker. There is a pattern. Bipartisan efforts, which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor, are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the Republican leadership that is running this Congress.The Speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order. Well, it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year, we are 6 days away from a general election, and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this Congress would have simply let the bipartisan majority that was trying to break out and do these things to be able to do them. And as a result, we have a dysfunctional Congress; we have an ineffectual Congress.Education is our most important priority. We have schools with cracked walls and no air-conditioning and leaky windows. We have cornices falling off of buildings. We have kids in temporary structures, in movable classrooms, in inadequate facilities in the wealthiest Nation on Earth. Our children deserve our help in getting them the world-class education that every child in this country deserves.Let us pass this resolution, let us stay here in these next days, and let us get the job done for America's children. We may not be able to do the health issues, campaign reform, gun safety or the minimum wage; but in the name of common sense, let us get done something in these last 2 or 3 days for the children of this country. Let us get them better classrooms, let us get them more teachers, let us get them a better education.,2015-03-16 18:17:29.372998,2015-03-16 18:17:29.372998,House,MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001,2000-11-01,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-11-01/html/CREC-2000-11-01-pt1-PgH11718-3.htm,142,23,146,H11718-H11726,G000132,mr. gephardt
623,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.Mr. Speaker, in 1965, Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, chairman of the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, gave a forceful speech advocating a greater role of the Federal Government through passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.In that great speech he said, ``We are compelled to give our most sincere and dedicated attention to the masses of our American youth, youth who give America new vision and new goals. We must not wait any longer. It is later than you think.''Today, Mr. Speaker, we are witness to the Republicans' contempt for the masses, for the 50 million children who attend public schools. Today, they bring to this floor a bill that would steal almost $2 billion from our public school systems. This proposal sends a clear and chilling signal that the Republicans have declared war on public education.The most cynical and pernicious provision of this bill is the wholesale and deliberate denial of civil rights. The parents of low-income students who fall for this voucher scheme will be shocked to learn that their children will attend a private school that has no obligation to protect them from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or age. The blatant disregard for civil rights fostered by proponents of this bill is an abomination.Mr. Speaker, yesterday I received a letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights vehemently opposing this Trojan Horse. In that letter, it was pointed out that under this bill, and I quote, ``Private schools could permit widespread and severe racial harassment of students in class, provide female students with inferior athletic facilities, and refuse to make any accommodations for disabled students.''The letter concludes, ``In short, H.R. 2746 would allow private schools to ignore the civil rights laws that have long protected students in federally funded education.''Mr. Speaker, this bill is an outrageous abandonment of civil rights. I find it ironic that the Speaker of the House stood on the floor of this House last week expressing compassion for little black children, while in fact this bill is striping away 30 years of civil rights protections from the very children he professed to help.Mr. Speaker, in all of my years in Congress, I have not heard so many in this Chamber, who for years have refused to look beyond race and poverty, to see the human needs, now plead so eloquently for those who are victimized by their race and economic condition. No one should be deceived by the false promise that this bill is about saving poor children from the debilitating fate of inner-city schools.Last year, Republicans in this House fought with every fiber of their being against increasing the minimum wage. In the 104th Congress, 223 House Republicans voted to cut child nutrition programs by $10 billion and to eliminate the Federal school lunch program entirely. Where was their compassion then?If proponents of this bill are genuinely concerned about bad schools in black neighborhoods and want to give real choice to poverty stricken and educationally deprived students, let them mandate a program to give poor children the opportunity to attend any public school in the area, even in the most affluent neighboring school districts. That would be real public school choice. No reasonable, fair-minded person would deny that schools in more affluent areas have greater resources and their students receive a more complete and demanding education than children in poor neighborhoods.This voucher bill has been condemned by a broad coalition of education groups because it does nothing to address crumbling and overcrowded schools or to improve teacher performance for the 50 million children now attending public schools.I challenge the Republican leadership to stop playing politics with America's school children and to stop bashing public schools, parents, and teachers. I challenge them, Mr. Speaker, to embrace America's public schools instead of attacking them with this deceitful voucher scheme.I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.,2015-03-16 18:17:29.526113,2015-03-16 18:17:29.526113,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,4,143,H9941-H9965,C000488,mr. clay
624,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I urge a ``no'' vote on vouchers and a ``yes'' vote for public schools. I want to say that I think everybody here tonight is well-meaning and everybody here I would submit cares about what happens to our children, but I believe that we have to enter into a new discussion. Part of that will happen with the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Roemer] on charter schools.There are other ideas that we are wanting to talk about: Early childhood development, Basics by Six, well-trained teachers and equipped classrooms, relief for crumbling and overcrowded schools, support for local plans to review neighborhood public schools, efficient and coordinated use of resources, parental choice for public schools. This is an agenda that begins to start a national conversation about how we improve our public schools.I had a meeting this morning in my district with the superintendents of all of the school districts in my district, the City of St. Louis, many of the county districts in St. Louis, Jefferson County, and I asked them about this agenda, and I asked them about what we ought to be talking about. Incidentally, most of those school districts, in fact all of them, get very good outcomes. That does not mean it is uniform. That does not mean that every kid is getting a good education. It does not mean every child is graduating, but they are getting some pretty darn good outcomes.We never talk much about that; we never congratulate the people in the public schools that are doing a good job and getting a good result, which is the vast majority of our public schools. We act sometimes as if all the schools are bad and all the kids are not getting an education. Not true.Mr. Speaker, when I asked my superintendents what they thought we ought to be talking about today instead of vouchers, they talked about repairing crumbling schools. One superintendent said, yes, you want to talk about computers? I cannot get an electric line from the electric pole outside my school to support computers. And then once, if I got the electricity and got the computers and got the software and trained the teachers, who would pay the connection charges to the Internet?They talked about early childhood education. Every kindergarten in Missouri does not have kids go all day at age 5. They said the best thing you could do would be to have the kids come all day at age 5 into kindergarten so we could get a good start. That would probably be more important than many of the other ideas put together. There is a long list of things that we ought to be talking about our public schools.Let me say to my colleagues, I think the organizing principle of this society should be making sure that every child is a productive citizen. After World War II we knew what the organizing principle in our society was. It was to make sure that we deterred nuclear war and we kept the Russians from invading us, and fighting communism, and everybody knew their role in that great mission that we won when the wall came down. But since then, we do not know what our organizing principle is. And the truth is, it is not just money; it is everybody's commitment to this task of making sure every child gets a chance at a good education.I was in a school in my district last week, Shepard's School in the City of St. Louis, and they had all the mothers there. The principal goes out and sees parents who will not come in and work in the school and the one mother got up and she said, I work at night, but I am here every day from 7:30 in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and I am here to do whatever the principal and the teachers want me to do. I said, why do you do this? She said, I have 2 kids in this school and I want them to have a good education and I want them to go to college. But then she said, but understand, every kid in this school is my child.That is the attitude that we have to have on the part of every American in this country. Every child is my child. Even if I do not have a child in the school, I want to be in the school, because we must raise these children to be productive citizens. We must not siphon off the dollars that are so desperately needed by our public schools to go to private schools. We have to make sure that they go to the children that are wanting and demanding an opportunity to succeed.Let us make that the organizing principle of this society. Let us stop this discussion of vouchers and let us get on to the discussion, the unfinished agenda of this country, to make the public schools in this country better. We can do it, and we are going to do it starting tonight.,2015-03-16 18:17:29.664210,2015-03-16 18:17:29.664210,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,166,143,H9941-H9965,G000132,mr. gephardt
625,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.In regards to that last statement, let me say that we on this side did not open this debate. It was Senator Lott who opened the debate. And this motion to instruct will correct the debate that Senator Lott opened.Mr. Speaker, let me read something from the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, in regards to this particular problem that we are dealing with. Secretary Riley says, ``I am deeply disappointed that Congress took steps in the wrong direction over the last 2 days as it failed to make a long-term commitment to reduce class size. Both the House and the Senate had opportunities to let local school districts know that funds will continue to be available, so that over 7 years 100,000 teachers can be hired to reduce class sizes in grades 1 to 3 to 18 students per teacher. However, they did not only fail to do that but instead, in the case of the Senate, retreated from the bipartisan agreement reached last year. There is nothing more timely or important than giving parents and teachers the reassurance that their children will be able to learn in smaller classes.''And Secretary Riley says, ``I urge Congress to drop the amendments that undermine last year's bipartisan agreement to reduce class size and reach agreement on the Ed-Flex bill with strong, responsible accountability provisions. It is unfortunate that the first education debate of this Congress ended in partisan efforts instead of addressing the serious issues confronting our Nation's schools. Our students, parents and teachers want, need and deserve better.''Mr. Speaker, I do not understand the switch in the Republican position on 100,000 new teachers to reduce classroom sizes. Last year the Republican leadership, including Speaker Newt Gingrich; the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Dick Armey); and chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Bill Goodling) gave glowing praise to the concept of 100,000 new teachers and voted to start on the 100,000 new teachers; voted for $1.2 billion to start funding the 100,000 new teachers.On October 15 of 1998, President Clinton and congressional budget negotiators reached agreement on a bill for 1999. Among the programs included in that agreement was $1.2 billion invested to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes across America. Here is how the Republican leaders described the 100,000 teachers legislation at the time.Former Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``We said the local school board would make the decision. No new Federal bureaucracy, no new State bureaucracy, not a penny in the bill that was passed goes to pay for bureaucracy. All of it goes to the local school districts.'' Then House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, called it ``A victory for the American people. There will be more teachers, and that is good for all Americans.''The majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Dick Armey), when asked what he would say are the key Republican achievements of this bill, responded, ``Well, I think quite frankly I am very proud of what we did and the timeliness of it. We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way to pay for them. And when the President's people are willing to work with us, so that we can let the State and local communities take this money, make these decisions, manage that money, spend the money on teachers as they saw the need, whether it be for special education or for regular teaching, with the freedom of choice and management and control at the local level, we thought this was good for America and good for the schoolchildren. We were very excited about the move toward that end.''That is the end of the quote of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Dick Armey). They were excited about hiring 100,000 new teachers last October.And the chairman of this committee, of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Bill Goodling). Let us see he said about it. He said, ``It is a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed up with the Washington mandates, red tape and regulation.'' He is talking about the mandating of 100,000 new teachers. That is his quote.So, Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues, if they are for reducing classes, if they are for giving children more individualized attention, if they are for improving student achievement, they must support the Clay motion to instruct.We should never pit one group of parents against each other to score political points. The disability community and the Chief States School Officers and the National PTA support this motion.We have promised America's schoolchildren 100,000 new, well-qualified teachers. This motion demonstrates that we intend to keep that promise, and I ask my colleagues to support the motion to instruct.Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:17:29.862346,2015-03-16 18:17:29.862346,House,APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 800, EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-23/html/CREC-1999-03-23-pt1-PgH1549.htm,46,42,145,H1549-H1556,C000488,mr. clay
626,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, I rise to speak of the need to preserve and protect the intense vital involvement of parents in decisionmaking in local schools all across America. If America is to succeed in the next generation, we have to have the capacity to have the kind of schools that meet the needs of our students. We will have to have the ability to experiment from one school district to another. We will have to have State and local governments that can tailor the programs which they have to meet the demands of their unique settings.Sometimes when we think about achievement, sometimes when we think about success, we think it might be necessary to try and impose the so-called ``wisdom of Washington'' upon the Nation generally. But, I think that temptation ought to quickly fly from us if we would think of what would have happened, for instance, if we decided there needed to be a single uniform type of computer and we had imposed it from Washington saying there would just be one way of doing things. Maybe we would have chosen Apple computers and their way of doing things instead of IBM and their way of doing things. Or maybe we would have chosen a single software company and said that is the only way it could be handled, and we wouldn't have the flourishing and the flowering and the kind of intense opportunity and plurality for the generation of marvelous alternatives that have made America the far and away overwhelming leader in terms of the technology.I think whenever we feel that temptation to draw to Washington, DC, the decisionmaking and the prerogative of developing for the Nation a single uniform policy which would take the diversity and the creativity out of the system and would cheat America of the vital creativity and opportunity that is expressed when people at the local level are involved, whenever we have that temptation, we should think about how bad it would be in so many areas had we had that kind of policy.America's ability to flourish as a success reflects the diversity of this country and the ability of different groups of individuals to approach things differently and to do so successfully. Not only does it provide for us an energy which carries us to excellence, it also means that we don't ever have all of our eggs in a single basket. We have the capacity to meet a variety of challenges. We have innovative and creative thinking. We have the capacity to look at things from different points of view.One of the things that the President sought to bring to the United States--and I think his intention was good--was he wanted to improve education, by bringing to us national testing, testing of students on an individual basis all across America with a uniform test promulgated by bureaucrats in Washington, a single test which would, unfortunately, chart the direction of education all across the country.When you make a test, you decide that you are testing for something. So if you are going to make up a test that is going to be imposed on the country, you are going to be testing for something and you have to define what you are testing for.So the development of a test, although it might not seem to be at first blush, is really the development of a curriculum. If you decide what you are going to test for, you have to decide what you are going to teach. Once you decide what you are going to teach, you have established a national curriculum.Oddly enough, even deciding what you are going to teach probably isn't all that is controlled with the development of a test.The development of a test probably decides how you are going to teach it, because if you teach English, for instance, with phonics, teach people how letters sound together, and combinations and the like, that is one way of teaching the English language and would be tested differently than teaching the English language with the so-called whole language approach where you just have the recognition of words by rote or memorization.So when you have something like a national test proposed, you have to understand that you are talking about uniformity, that you are going to impose a single system all across the country, going to make everybody pretty much the same, you are going to deprive the system of the creativity and the vitality and diversity of what a lot of different folks can do when they are working simultaneously on a problem.Second, you are not only going to have uniformity, but you are going to determine from Washington, DC--if you have a uniform test, you are going to have a uniform curriculum. What to teach and how to teach it then becomes a uniform decision by bureaucrats. Because in order to test accurately, you have to know exactly what you are teaching and, of course, what you are teaching for will depend on how you are teaching.It troubles me to think that we might take these most fundamental decisions in education and pry them from the prerogative of parents and move them to the educators or bureaucrats of Washington, DC.As a matter of fact, the bureaucrats, educational bureaucrats, in Washington, DC, do not have a very good record. The bureaucrats in Washington, DC, run a couple school systems. We know that.As a matter of fact, they run the Department of Defense Dependent School System. A year or two ago they tried to put the so-called whole math into that system. The results were devastating. The median percentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by more than 37,000 Department of Defense dependent school students, 1 year after the Defense Department introduced whole math, dropped 14 percent for third graders--this is the median percentile score--dropped 20 percent for fourth graders, 20 percent for fifth graders, 17 percent for sixth graders, and 17 percent for seventh graders. One year's implementation of a fad, of the new whole math, devastated the performance of those students.I am not sure we want to yield the control of our public schools to the Federal Government so we can have that kind of devastating impact. I sure do not.Maybe, if you think the Federal Government does things particularly well, you should look at another school system which the Federal Government runs. It is called the District of Columbia School System, where, I think, we have the highest per capita expenditure on students anywhere in the world, and we have some of the lowest achievement levels.What I am trying to say is, we do not need to forfeit to the Federal bureaucracy in Washington, DC, the decisionmaking in education of what to teach and how to teach it, and we need far less to take parents out of the equation.Some people might not understand the value of parents in education, but there has been a lot of work in the educational research area about the value of parents in education. A 1980 report in ``Psychology in the Schools'' shows that family involvement improved Chicago elementary schoolchildren's performance in reading comprehension dramatically.One year after initiating a Chicago citywide program aimed at helping parents create academic support conditions in the home, students in grades one through six ``intensively exposed to the program'' improved .5 to .6 grade equivalents in reading comprehension on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills over students less intensively involved in the program--a 50- to 60-percent better level of improvement when the parents are deeply involved.If we are going to take parents out of the equation of what to teach and how to teach and we are going to tell them, do not bother to try to get active in your schools, because if things are not working there, you would have to change the whole country in order to change what happens at your schools, and besides, all the decisions are going to be made at sort of a quasi-national school board in Washington, DC, I do not think we are going to get effective parental involvement. That is why I believe that locally controlled schools are the fundamental thing that we ought to pursue. It is not only true for Chicago schoolchildren, it has been proven over and over again in other cities across the Nation in a variety of studies.It is important that we have parental involvement. It is important that we have local determination. It is important that we not yield to Washington, DC, the capacity to impose uniform curricula and a uniform teaching methodology all across the country. It would stifle creativity. It would impair achievement in a very, very significant way.The Republican agenda for education has not been to centralize education in Washington, DC. Our agenda, as expressed in this legislative session, has been to give local schools block grants. It has been to send them the power to do what they know they need to do.I heard Congressman Goodling from the House talk about the President's plan to improve education with just one more test. We already have between three and nine standardized tests every year for every student in the country, according to USA Today.Congressman Goodling put it this way: ``If you are trying to fatten cattle, they don't get fat by weighing them one more time.'' If you are trying to educate students, they don't get smart just by being tested one more time. Students not only have the regular tests of their instructional regime, they also have these three to nine other tests which are taking instructional time. And they are telling us pretty clearly where we are educationally. We know where there is much to achieve, but weighing the cattle one more time, testing the students one more time, will not make them fatter or smarter.The truth of the matter is, the solution is to do things like the Republicans have sought to do here, which is to get more capacity into the hands of schools so that it can be devoted to students and teachers, not to the bureaucracy in Washington--a clear contrast.The bureaucracy in Washington grows under President Clinton's ability to dictate, through the backdoor of testing, a curriculum and a teaching style in uniformity across America. Under the Republican proposals, instead of having a growing bureaucracy, you take the resource which would otherwise be sapped by the bureaucracy in Washington, and you target it on the schools, you give block grants to local schools.Another Republican initiative, the A-plus accounts, gives parents choices. Instead of taking parents out of the equation by saying we are going to have a national school board that no parent could afford to come and talk to and that would impose a uniform regime all across America, the Republican plan is to empower parents, to give parents choice. Let parents invest resources so that they can send their children to the schools that the parents choose and invest those resources absent the kind of onerous tax burdens that parents normally would have on their investments.The President's agenda is more programs, more bureaucracies, more of Washington-knows-best. The Republican agenda is a commitment to local schools, local control, local education, the creativity, the pluralism, yes, the diversity and the energy that comes when we have local schools all across America.There is an effort being made in this year's appropriations measure to harmonize the kind of demands that are being made by the administration and the items that were passed in the Senate with items that were passed in the House. I think it is fundamentally important that we protect local schools. If we are not willing to stand up to protect the local schools, the prerogative of parents to operate in those schools, to be effective there, to get involved meaningfully in the development of curriculum and the development of teaching methodology, I think we will have failed in our duty.I intend to do whatever I can, as we close this session--and I mean ``whatever I can''--to make sure we arrive at a conclusion which makes it possible for parents to continue to have that kind of beneficial impact.At the end of this year the President and his bureaucrats seem to be winning. America's children are losing. The block grants, which would have cut the Washington bureaucracy by sending more funds directly to local school districts, were all but abandoned, and I commend the occupant of the Chair for having that idea, which is one of the best ideas that has been offered to help education in this Congress in decades.Scholarships for needy children in the District of Columbia were filibustered to death. Instead of giving parents the power to help their children in education, we lost on that ground. And the President has indicated that, if we succeed on that ground, he will veto it.On Tuesday, the Senate voted to kill A-plus accounts to help parents pay for the costs of their children's education. At least the vote was to not allow that to go forward. We could not get cloture. So those who sought to reinforce the position of the President there deprived America of another opportunity for parents to be beneficially involved.We have lost on the block grants. We lost on the A-plus accounts. We lost on the scholarships for DC students that would empower parents.A final ballot remains over national testing. It is a cause from which I do not intend to waiver.I do not think Senators should pack their bags for the recess just yet. There are rights to defend. There are students whose interests are in the balance. I do not think we should sacrifice the next generation's education for a few extra days of rest at the end of this year. I certainly do not intend to do so myself.National tests would lead to a national curriculum. I think we can all understand that. The President keeps saying that the national testing system he is proposing would be voluntary. He said these will all be voluntary. Do not worry. No school district would be required to be involved in these tests.That is what he said in Washington, DC. That is what he said in his State of the Union Message. That is what he said recently. Perhaps he thought we were not listening carefully when he was speaking in Lansing, MI, on March 10 of this year, 1997. He put it this way:I want to create a climate in which no one can say no, in which it's voluntary but you are ashamed if you don't give your kids the chance to do [these tests].Here is a President who says this is to be voluntary, but he says he wants to make it so no one can say no. When the President has the ability to control funding, and when he has the opportunity to give grants and otherwise to make favorable or unfavorable decisions about what happens in schools, I doubt seriously whether there will be a real opportunity for these to be voluntary.William Safire recently warned of the dangers of allowing the administration's testing proposal. And I quote William Safire in his editorial from the New York Times op-ed page entitled ``Flunk that Test.'' He put it this way:We're only talking about math and English, say the national standard-bearers, and shucks, it's only voluntary.I continue to quote Safire.Don't believe that; if the nose of the camel gets under the tent, the hump of a national curriculum, slavish teaching to homogenizing tests, and a black market in answers would surely follow.You know, the evils of a national test have long been understood, not just by Republicans, but by Democrats as well, because they have understood that national testing ultimately dictates national curricula.Perhaps one of the most eloquent in that respect was Joseph Califano. Joseph Califano was the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Carter administration. When Joseph Califano was asked about national tests, he warned the American people. He put it this way:Any set of test questions that the federal government prescribed should surely be suspect as a first step toward a national curriculum. . . . In its most extreme form, [Joseph Califano went on to warn] national control of curriculum is a form of national control of ideas.We could have a long debate about the potential evils of national control of ideas, but it is pretty clear to me that none of us believes that Washington, DC, should control ideas. I think all of us understand that if Washington, DC, controls things, it generally does not do them well. As a matter of fact, what this country has controlled from Washington, DC, has not been exemplary. It has been an example of what to avoid rather than what to embrace.When you are talking with individuals about the so-called tests which they would impose, you have to wonder whether Washington's imposition of tests would be something like Washington's attempted imposition of the standards for history, which they tried to develop at the end of the last decade and early in the 1990's.The National Endowment for the Humanities sought to develop a set of history standards telling us what we should know and what we should teach. What was interesting to me is that the standards tended to be far more politically correct than they were historically correct.When you are thinking about mathematics, I do not think we should think about that which is politically correct or historically correct. We should think about things that are arithmetically correct.But here is what happened to the national history standards. The national history standards were more interested in those who were politically correct.The standards slighted or ignored many central figures in U.S. history, particularly white males. To name a few, Robert E. Lee was left out, Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers were left out, Paul Revere was left out, so we could have many, many references to the Ku Klux Klan, so we could have references to heroes from other continents.The truth of the matter is the U.S. Senate understood what was happening there and voted against those standards. I believe that these standards were rejected unanimously in the Senate. George Will attacked the failed history standards as ``cranky anti-Americanism.'' It didn't surprise the American public. The American public has witnessed the Federal Government go awry, time after time after time on issue after issue after issue.The proponents of the proposed national tests have indicated that their interest is in the whole math curriculum. As a matter of fact, when we found out what they were talking about with the whole math curriculum we discovered they were talking about a rejection of computation. Computation is 3 times 6 is 18; 3 times 18 is 54; 4 times 18 is 72. They reject that. One whole math proponent was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as having said we can't ask students to say 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2, carry the 4. They said that is discriminatory. Most students can't do that, they are too dumb. That is ridiculous. Our students are smarter than that. They are not that dumb.As a matter of fact, the only thing that will dumb down American education is if we have low expectations. I have studies that show when you have low expectations you get low performance. Here you have people designing the tests who want to run away from the ability of American students to compute. They want to supply everyone with a calculator so no one has to know the multiplication table and no one has to do things in his or her head. I think such dumbing down of America's educational performance would be inappropriate.Most importantly, it is fundamental that we maintain in this great land the ability of moms and dads to be at the focal point of educational policy and development and not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. It is fundamentally important that we maintain local control of education rather than Washington control.As we are working our way to see whether or not we can have an appropriations bill that maintains this balance, I want to say to the U.S. Senate that we have an obligation to stay here and work until we do protect the rights and opportunities of the next generation for a decent education by making sure that their parents are in charge, that local school boards and States are in charge, and that we don't forfeit the prerogatives of education policy to bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who would impose a kind of mindless ``dumbed down'' national curriculum which would fail to have the diversity and creativity and energy --especially the energy--that comes from local involvement that we need.I intend to do whatever I can and everything that is possible to make sure that we protect that prerogative. I hope Members of this body and Members of the House will join me in doing so. As we are seeking in these moments to reach an agreement with the White House in this respect, I hope it will be their understanding that a plan to have a uniform stifling environment promulgated from Washington is not a plan for a prosperous America but is a plan which would pull the educational rug out from under the feet of our children and would destroy our capacity to compete in the next generation.I yield the floor.,2015-03-16 18:17:30.141545,2015-03-16 18:17:30.141545,Senate,NATIONAL TESTING,1997-11-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-06/html/CREC-1997-11-06-pt1-PgS11852.htm,154,0,143,S11852-S11854,A000356,mr. ashcroft
627,MO,Todd,Akin,R,I think you're absolutely right.The idea, though, that we can bring the level of spending that we've got going on under control by just trying to get efficiency, I think that's probably optimistic. I think what we have to do is decide that there are some things that Washington, D.C. should not be doing in the first place. We shouldn't cut it; we should just totally eliminate it. It should just stop. None. We need to take a good look at our Federal spending and say, What are the things the Federal Government has to do? We have to defend our Nation. We know that much. Because the States aren't going to do that. We have to make sure there's no pirates on the high seas. There used to be a law, it was one of the few Federal laws against piracy on the high seas. There was a Federal law when America started that was against counterfeiting, because that was not a State job; that had to be a Federal job.There are very few jobs that originally started at the Federal level. And then everything else, we have to push them back to the States. I would be happy to say, look, if the people of California, or Massachusetts, or Tennessee want to have socialized medicine, let them try it and see how it works. They could learn from Massachusetts. It didn't work well. They could learn from Tennessee. They about shut down medicine in Tennessee. If States want to try these things, let the experiments begin at the State level. But at the Federal level, we have got to basically stop a lot of stuff. The first place I would start with would be just what Ronald Reagan said, shut down that Department of Education.I had a group I was talking to down at a Honda dealership just a couple of days ago and I asked them, How much benefit do you think you've gotten from a whole bunch of Federal bureaucrats that work in the Department of Education? Has it helped your kid any at all? There were these blank looks. No, I don't think it's helped a whole lot.So what happens if you sell the building and just shut down the Department of Education at the Federal level? Why can't that be done at the State or local level? I think we have to ask those tough questions. Maybe you could make a case, gosh, it would be nice if; but we can't afford it.Here's a number: Debt and deficit as a percent of GDP. This is deficit. Here's the United States.

628,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with deep sorrow that I inform the House of the death of Mrs. Mary L. James.Mary, who was born in West Plains, MO, was a graduate of Harrisonville, MO, High School and the University of Missouri, where she received a bachelor of science degree in education. Mary also earned a master's of public administration degree from the University of Kansas.Through the years, Mary dedicated her life to education, health care, and to the betterment of her community and her state. She was a teacher, a volunteer, and lived her whole life surrounded by or working in the news business. In 1999, Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Mary as a member of the University of Missouri Board of Curators, and she became the board's president in 2005.Mary also served organizations affiliated with the University of Missouri, which she so dearly loved, including the Chancellor's Fund for Excellence, the Advisory and Development Committee within the College of Education, and the Griffith's Leadership Society for Women. Mary was also a member of the Jefferson Club. In 2005, the Alumni Alliance recognized Mary for Outstanding Alumni Service to the University of Missouri System.Mary also worked as the executive director of the Cass Medical Center Foundation, on the board of the Healthcare Foundation of Greater Kansas City, and on the board of the Cass Medical Foundation. In 2006, she was recognized by the University of Missouri as a Distinguished Friend to the School of Nursing because of her commitment to health care and to the University.Mary also served as a member of the Harrisonville Park Board, including time as chairman. During her tenure on the park board, she advocated for a community sales tax that led to building a pool and maintenance facility for the city of Harrisonville, she wrote a grant and raised funds to build an outdoor theater, and she helped plan for a community center. Mary was a member of the Harrisonville Chamber of Commerce, the Harrisonville United Methodist Church, Chapter G.R. PEO, Delta Gamma, and the University of Missouri Alumni Association.Mary's family had been prominent in the Missouri newspaper business. Her parents, the late J.W. Brown, Jr., and Wanda A. Brown, were publishers of the Cass County Democrat-Missourian in Harrisonville. Her father served as Missouri Press Association President. She worked for 26 years as the human resources manager for Cass County Publishing, volunteering extensively in her spare time.In 1971, Mary married Bill James, who himself has been a prominent figure in the Missouri newspaper business and is a former president of the Missouri Press Association. Bill is now the publisher of the Daily Star-Journal in Warrensburg, Missouri.Mary, who is survived by Bill, by her two sons and their wives, by one granddaughter, by her mother, and by her sister, will be remembered fondly by all who had the privilege of knowing her, including me. She has led an exemplary life, which ought to serve as a model for young people in Missouri and throughout our nation. I know members of the Congress will join me in paying tribute the life of Mary James and in extending condolences to her family and friends.,2015-03-16 18:17:30.534822,2015-03-16 18:17:30.534822,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF MARY JAMES,2009-01-09,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-01-09/html/CREC-2009-01-09-pt1-PgE58-2.htm,4,0,155,E58,S000465,mr. skelton

631,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to William Clay, Sr., my father, and a former United States Congressman from the 1st Congressional District in St. Louis, Missouri. Bill Clay has fought a long and historic battle in defense civil and human rights for all Americans throughout his life. His dedication and service to our Nation as a leader on education, labor rights and civil rights, aptly earns his place in the Missouri Walk of Fame and the privilege of being honored today before Congress.William Lacy Clay, Sr. one of six children was born on April 30, 1931, in St. Louis, Missouri to Luella Hyatt and Irving Clay. He is happily married to his wife of 55 years Carol, and they have raised three children, Vicki, Michelle and William, Jr.When Bill Clay was elected to Congress in 1968, he was the first African American member elected from Missouri and one of only two African American representatives from states west of the Mississippi River. Throughout his 16 terms in Congress, he gained a reputation as an effective legislator. A staunch advocate for civil rights and social justice, he also served as one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. From 1991 to 1995 he chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and served as the Ranking Member on the Education and the Workforce Committee until he retired.His success can largely be attributed to his belief that there were no permanent friends or permanent enemies in politics, just permanent interests. He was a true advocate for the people that he represented, and he served them well. He's been credited with turning back racial discrimination throughout his career and remains an outspoken leader in our community. An accomplished author, he has documented he history of not only St. Louis, but the political arena throughout the Civil Rights era up to and including the present.He worked tirelessly on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised, always seeking to give them a voice in Congress. During his tenure he authored the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital Financing Act, which provided $375 million in federal loan guarantees for construction and renovation projects at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and played a key role in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including efforts to reduce early grade class sizes by hiring 100,000 teachers nationwide.Throughout his illustrious Congressional career, Clay co-sponsored 3,403 bills, of which 279 were enacted. Of the 248 bills that he sponsored, 16 were enacted. Bill Clay was the key sponsor of the transcendent Family and Medical Leave Act, the first bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton. This bill helped change the life of American families. He was instrumental in passing the Hatch Act which reformed the political activities of federal employees.He continues to contribute to the American political landscape through his work as a successful author. He has authored several works including Just Permanent Interests: Black Americans in Congress, 1870-1991 (1992), which many view as essential American political reading. He continues to be a wonderful husband, loving father, and grandfather.Madam Speaker, my father is my hero and I am proud to salute him for his lasting contributions to both our local St. Louis community and to our Nation. His outstanding leadership and sincere commitment to justice make him more than worthy of receiving our recognition and I urge my colleagues to join me in commending Former Congressman William Clay, Sr. for his induction into the Missouri Walk of Fame and his legacy of serving our Nation.,2015-03-16 18:17:30.976139,2015-03-16 18:17:30.976139,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM CLAY, SR.: A CIVIL RIGHTS PIONEER, GREAT LEGISLATOR AND A PERMANENT PART OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL LANDSCAPE,2008-09-22,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2008-09-22/html/CREC-2008-09-22-pt1-PgE1855.htm,150,0,154,E1855,C001049,mr. clay
632,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge a debate about the budget and Social Security. Tomorrow Republicans mark up their budget in committee. Next week they put it on the floor for consideration. Their budget will reveal the following facts: Republicans spent $4 trillion in surplus funds. They created deficits as far as the eye can see. They drained $2 trillion from Social Security, breaking promises made repeatedly to safeguard these funds. Their policies reversed 8 years of progress. Their budgets brought a historic reversal that impacts people's lives.Fifteen months ago, unemployment was under 4 percent. We were having serious discussions about what we were going to do with this huge and mounting surplus. How much should we save for Social Security? How much should we put into Medicare? How much should we invest in a prescription drug program? Should we put more money in education? Should we pay down more debt? And there were many who said that we could do all of it because the surplus was so enormous.So where are we today, March 12, 2002? We are not discussing what to do with the surplus. The surplus is just about gone. Today we are having that tired, troubled discussion we had for much of the last 20 years: What are we going to do about the deficit? How are we going to save Social Security? What are we going to do to save Medicare? And how are we going to take care of health insurance for the unemployed?This is a Republican budget that breaks promises made over and over in the last 3 years to protect Social Security. It fails to keep our inter-generational contract and commitment. It threatens the retirement security of millions of baby boomers. In the aftermath of Enron, it is the height of irresponsibility.Five times, Republicans put bills on this floor to create Social Security lock boxes. They voted five times to make the trust fund for Social Security inviolate. They voted five times to save Social Security first. Yet, they put forward a budget that jeopardizes Social Security just as the baby boomers are about to retire. Their budget spends the Medicare surplus in each of the next 10 years. It makes a meaningful Medicare prescription drug program impossible. It reduces our commitment to public education, and it cuts programs promoting clean air and water that makes a difference in children's lives.This is not a debate in the end about the budget. It is a debate about integrity, and it is a debate about responsibility. It is a debate about the values we want guiding our budget decisions.What are our values? In this budget, our values call for keeping our commitments by saving Social Security first. Our values call for adding a real prescription benefit to Medicare, where it belongs. Our values call for making every public school a great and successful public school. Our values call for paying the Federal debt down. Our values call for cutting taxes in order to promote long-term economic growth and opportunity.I will never forget 1993. We balanced the budget. We made tough choices because we believed in opportunity, responsibility, and community. We put that plan together using the right values.So I urge Republicans, let us pass a budget that invests in national security, homeland defense, education, prescription drugs and our environment, and keeps Social Security sound and puts the Nation back on the path to fiscal health. Let us have an economic growth summit to reach the goals we all share. Let us get about keeping our commitments. Let us get about saving Social Security first and doing it beginning today.,2015-03-16 18:17:31.146262,2015-03-16 18:17:31.146262,House,THE BUDGET REVERSAL,2002-03-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-03-12/html/CREC-2002-03-12-pt1-PgH788.htm,27,1,148,H788,G000132,mr. gephardt
633,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, November 11-17 is National Osteopathic Medicine Week, a week when we recognize the more than 47,000 osteopathic physicians, D.O.s, across the country for their contributions to the American healthcare system. This year, we celebrate D.O.s commitment to preventative medicine and end-of-life care. I am especially pleased these festivities are taking place in my home State of Missouri.During National Osteopathic Medicine, NOM, Week, D.O.s and patients celebrate the benefits of preventative health care by looking at the simple things that can be done to live healthier lives. As physicians who treat people, not just symptoms, the nation's D.O.s are dedicated to helping maintain health through a whole-person patient-centered approach to healthcare. And, within that principle, they recognize death as the legitimate endpoint to the human lifecycle and respect the dignity and special needs of both patients and caregivers.During NOM Week, D.O.s across the country will explore multidisciplinary perspectives on end-of-life care, the ethical debate of pain management and physician-assisted suicide and ways to remove communications barriers in the physician-patient relationship at end of life. Activities also educate Americans about end-of-life care and related topics, such as advances in pain management, cultural sensitivities toward final stages of life, organ donation, advance directives, and end-of-life care options and financing.For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives and health of my fellow citizens in Missouri as well as all Americans. Overall, more than 100 million patient visits are made each year to D.O.s. Osteopathic physicians are committed to serving the needs of rural and underserved communities and make up 15 percent of the total physician population in towns of 10,000 or less.D.O.s are certified in nearly 60 specialties and 33 subspecialties. Similar to requirements set for M.D.s, D.O.s must complete and pass: 4 years of medical education at one of 19 osteopathic medical schools; a 1-year internship; a multi-year residency; and a State medical board exam. Throughout this education, D.O.s are trained to understand how the musculoskeletal system influences the condition of all other body systems. Many patients want this extra education as a part of their health care. Individuals may call 866-346-3236 to find a D.O. in their community.In recognition of NOM Week, I would like to congratulate the over 1,700 D.O.s in Missouri, the 616 students at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, 871 students at the University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine and the 47,000 D.O.s represented by the American Osteopathic Association for their contributions to the good health of the American people. ,2015-03-16 18:17:31.319382,2015-03-16 18:17:31.319382,Senate,NATIONAL OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE WEEK,2001-11-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-11-13/html/CREC-2001-11-13-pt1-PgS11718.htm,156,0,147,S11718,B000611,mr. bond
634,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.First of all, Mr. Chairman, I would like to correct the Record. The previous speaker referred to the TRIO program as a minority outreach program, but it is not. It is a disadvantaged outreach program, and the majority of students enrolled in TRIO are white.Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Riggs). His attempt to ban the use of affirmative action efforts by colleges and universities is nothing more than a scheme to return the system of higher education to the bad old days of racial segregation. If we follow that direction, our schools will again become a bastion of white, male, good old boys.In addition, this amendment completely shatters the bipartisan nature of H.R. 6, which has been successfully developed by the members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. It is a cruel hoax, Mr. Chairman, to declare that we live in a color-blind society in which only merit counts. Merit is only one criterion for college admissions.Children of alumni have always received special treatment. Children of wealthy donors have always been shown preferential treatment. Athletic ability and musical talents have always been major considerations when deciding whom to admit to colleges and universities. Colleges routinely seek to have classes which reflect geographical differences and other kinds of diversity in the belief that diversity is good educationally.Affirmative action was not designed to deny rights unjustly to those qualified, but to provide remedies for those qualified who are unjustly denied. For this Congress to now prohibit efforts by university leaders to correct centuries of inequitable admission practices is an arrogant abuse of Federal power. It has taken the Nation's colleges nearly 3 decades to develop and implement admission policies which have begun to close the educational gap existing between minorities, women, and their white male counterparts.Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to Proposition 209, passed by California voters, and its effects on minority admission to institutions of higher learning will be just as devastating. Admissions of African American, Latino, and American Indian students for next fall's classes have plunged by more than half at the University of California at Berkeley; and admissions of minorities to the University of California's three law schools have dropped 71 percent for blacks and 35 percent for Latinos.Mr. Chairman, there is no validity to the argument that enrollment declines are indicative of previously ineligible students being admitted to these institutions of higher learning. The fact is that over 800 minority students with grade point averages of 4.0 and SAT scores of over 1,200 were denied admission to the University of California at Berkeley.The simple fact is that some believe women, blacks, and Latinos should not be afforded a higher education. The Riggs amendment would embody that belief in Federal law. It was bad policy during the awful period of Jim Crow laws in America, and it is bad policy now.Mr. Chairman, measured by any benchmark, access to equal educational opportunity remains a distant dream for racial minorities. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the Riggs antiaffirmative action amendment.Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:17:31.572561,2015-03-16 18:17:31.572561,House,HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998,1998-05-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-05-06/html/CREC-1998-05-06-pt1-PgH2860-3.htm,55,167,144,H2860-H2920,C000488,mr. clay
635,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues and I have come to this Congress for one single fundamental purpose: to fight for the working and middle-class families that are at the very heart of this country.Throughout this very long and difficult budget process, we have held every policy and every proposal to a simple test: Does it make it easier for the lives of families that are working hard, trying to educate their children, trying to save for a decent retirement; or does it make that struggle even harder?That is why Democrats fought so hard for a budget that does not cut education, student loans, or summer jobs, or roll back clean air or water standards or abandon the 100,000 police that we so desperately need on our streets.This is not a perfect budget. This has been a difficult compromise on both sides. But I believe we have proven that we can cut the budget without cutting education or the environment, that we can rein in runaway spending without ravaging hard-working American families.Mr. Speaker, while this is a day for both parties to come together, America must not forget that, without the Democratic Party, we would not have kept our commitment to educate America's children, to keep our environment safe and to insure basic health and safety standards in the workplace. Without the Democratic Party, we would not have kept our faith with working families in the middle class.See, that is what the Democratic Party stands for. That is who we are. And that is why even after 2 Government shutdowns and 13 temporary spending bills, we would never ever give up the fight for education and health care and the environment and safe workplaces.I will never forget visiting an elementary school in Houston with the gentleman from Texas, Gene Green, and the gentlewoman from Texas, Sheila Jackson-Lee, seeing the young children playing with computers and learning to read in intensive after-hour classes sponsored by chapter 1, and seeing the hope and the joy of these youngsters in being able to learn. This budget is for those children and their families. Or being in New Orleans and seening the chapter 1 mothers and their children meeting, and hearing a young mother stand up and saying because of chapter 1 she was getting her high school degree and planned to go to college and said she wanted to get her masters degree because her children were enrolled in chapter 1 in an inner-city school in New Orleans.So I commend my Republican colleagues for letting us save those commitments and making this budget work for working families.Today we celebrate a victory, not of party or partisanship, but of America's most basic and important values. Vote for this budget, and let it be a model of the kind of bipartisanship and working together that I will hope will mark the rest of this Congress.,2015-03-16 18:17:31.724671,2015-03-16 18:17:31.724671,House,CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3019, BALANCED BUDGET DOWN PAYMENT ACT, II,1996-04-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-25/html/CREC-1996-04-25-pt1-PgH4046.htm,55,115,142,H4046-H4101,G000132,mr. gephardt
636,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Madam Speaker, I reluctantly rise in support of H.R. 1720 which provides straight reauthorizations for three education programs scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Those programs are the National Literacy Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. The 1-year extensions included in this bill will help add some certainty to these programs as they continue to compete for funding through the appropriations process.In addition, the legislation includes changes to other programs that were worked out through bipartisan negotiations involving both the House and the Senate earlier this year.This bill provides for the privatization of two Government-sponsored enterprises, Sallie Mae and Connie Lee. I have already voted in support of privatization and will do so again today, but, as I said, with reluctance. Let me explain my apprehension.Last Thursday, in response to a request by a member of my staff for harmless information from Sallie Mae regarding privatization revenue, Sallie Mae mistakenly faxed him a document which strongly suggests possible partisan work by Sallie Mae officials on behalf of the Republicans.There are at least two very disturbing things about the document. First, the document is referred to as a ``candidate's package,'' and it is a highly charged, partisan document that will help Republicans attack the direct loan program and gives them ammunition to defend themselves against the accurate charges that they have tried to cut student loans.The second alarming thing about the fax is that it includes a cover page showing that the document was sent to a Republican representative, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Tom Davis, by one of Sallie Mae's House lobbyists. That fax page has a note on it to Mr. Davis that says, and I quote, ``Here's the full candidate's package.'' Other details about this bizarre and potentially illegal activity are described in this morning's Washington Post.However, I might say in defense of Sallie Mae that the president and chief executive officer wrote a letter to me dated September 18, where he says that, and I quote, ``The document which I have subsequently read is completely inappropriate in its language and tone, and I am at a loss to express my disappointment that this should have happened. This material was not sanctioned nor reviewed by either myself or senior management.''Also, the chairman of the board wrote to President Clinton and he noted that he had directed that an internal investigation be conducted and that appropriate disciplinary action be taken against those individuals responsible for this document.Madam Speaker, I think that the appropriate agencies and congressional committees have an obligation to fully investigate this matter, and until that happens, a dark cloud will hang over the issue of Sallie Mae's privatization.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:17:31.891789,2015-03-16 18:17:31.891789,House,GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1996,1996-09-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-09-24/html/CREC-1996-09-24-pt1-PgH10783-3.htm,133,4,142,H10783-H10802,C000488,mr. clay
637,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I oppose this conference report for the same reason that I voted against the original bill, H.R. 800. This report fails to include strong accountability provisions and fails to adequately protect Title I provisions that target assistance to our poorest children.It is legislative folly, Mr. Speaker, to let States and school districts waive the Elementary and Secondary Act before its reauthorization has been even drafted or passed. To proclaim an urgent need for this bill is part of the folly and the foolishness.Current law authorizes Secretary Riley to give flexibility to States and school districts by waiver. And the Secretary has granted hundreds of waivers to school districts based on requests that permitted flexibility yet preserved the sound principles of accountability and targeting the funds to areas of greatest educational need.But, Mr. Speaker, this bill creates unprecedented loopholes for States and school districts to avoid their obligation to serve poor school children first. It eliminates the long established requirement that only schools with poverty rates of 50 percent or greater can create school-wide programs with these Federal funds.This bill permits States to serve wealthier schools before serving poor ones and allows States to reduce per-student allocations at poor schools or pass over poor schools entirely to fund those wealthier schools.This conference report also strikes the sunset provision sponsored by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) which was contained in the House-passed bill. The Kildee provision would have required us to review these waiver provisions during the ESEA reauthorization. Despite the strong recommendation by Secretary Riley to consider the waiver provisions as part of the reauthorization of ESEA, the majority conferees agreed to strike the sunset provision.I am pleased however, Mr. Speaker, that the conferees did support my motion instructing conferees to strike the Lott amendment. This amendment was a reckless abandonment of our commitment to parents and students to reduce class sizes. By striking the Lott amendment, we ensured that the $1.2 billion class size reduction fund will be made available this July as promised.Now that we are nearing the completion of this bill, I hope that we can go to work on reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and other education priorities. Mr. Speaker, we must act to authorize the class size reduction program so we can finish the job of hiring 100,000 new teachers that we started last year.We should help communities struggling to pay for school modernization by supporting the Clinton school construction legislation. We must also continue our work to help communities recruit new, highly qualified teachers, and to strengthen accountability for our elementary and secondary education programs.So I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this legislation because it fails to contain minimum accountability provisions and basic protections for poor school children. We should vote against this proposal because it permits Federal funds to be taken from those students in greatest need and given to those in least need.Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:17:32.031887,2015-03-16 18:17:32.031887,House,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-04-21/html/CREC-1999-04-21-pt1-PgH2208-4.htm,55,21,145,H2208-H2218,C000488,mr. clay
638,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Father Thomas J. Savage, S.J., the 11th President of Rockhurst College. The passing of this exceptional man leaves us with a great sense of sadness and grief. Fr. Thom cannot easily be described in words but the impact he made upon the Greater Kansas City region is monumental and reflects his selfness, lifelong mission to assist those most in need. He was not just a leader but a visionary whose accomplishments continue to positively affect our community.Fr. Thom was especially talented in three areas of expertise: urban planning, education, and spirituality. During his tenure at Rockhurst College, he directed the campus renovation and construction of several facilities including the state of the art Richardson Science Center, the Town House Village, the Jesuit Residence, and Van Ackersen Hall. His goal was to expand Rockhurst's services to its students and to the community. Never forgetting the College's neighbors, the made great efforts to make the school inclusive by taking advantage of its urban location. By using valuable input and resources from members of the community as he further developed the area, he opened communication and strengthened a lasting friendship and alliance with the neighbors of Rockhurst.Committed to lifelong learning and the Rockhurst motto: ``Not what to think, but how to think,'' Fr. Thom supervised and supported the revision of the college's liberal arts core curriculum, the introduction of the master's degree programs in occupational and physical therapy, and a unique partnership with Saint Louis University in South Kansas City at the Ignatius Center. In his own life, education played a significant part in shaping his role as a leader for our community and nation. Fr. Thom obtained an undergraduate degree in philosophy and sociology from Boston College, held a doctor of education and a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University, and a master's degree in city and regional planning from the University of California at Berkeley.Instructed in the Jesuit tradition and officially ordained in 1979, Fr. Thom always aimed for high intellectual and ethnical standards and moral responsibility. He was a trailblazer who celebrated diversity, respect and true justice. In each aspect of his life he sought to bring about goodness. Even with a full workload and schedule, he could be heard in a lively debate on Sunday mornings on the radio as one of the hosts of ``Religion on the Line.'' His past roles in our community are evidence of his conscientious and generous intentions. As Co-Chairman of FOCUS Kansas City, Chairman of the Missouri Humanities Council, Vice President of the Kansas City Chapter of Phil Beta Kappa, Trustee of the Liberty Memorial Association, Member of the Menninger Clinic Board of Directors, the Kauffman Foundation Board of Trustees, the Midwest Research Institute Board of Trustees, the Preferred Health Professionals Board of Directors, and the Holocaust Memorial Advisory Board, Fr. Thom demonstrated his personal commitment to many worthy causes. He wrote for several publications and newspapers to share his views on board governance, trustees, Catholicism, and pedagogical issues.Fr. Thom Savage is truly an inspiration for all who knew him and were touched by his innumerable acts of kindness. His sharp, honed wit and personable, outgoing nature were character trademarks and will be sorely missed. Along with many others from our region and across the nation, I mourn the death of this outstanding man. He will long be recognized as a hero, an agent of change, a champion for the underprivileged, a spiritual leader, and most importantly a friend to everyone in my community.Mr. Speaker, please join me in extending sympathy to his mother and the entire Savage family.,2015-03-16 18:17:32.169985,2015-03-16 18:17:32.169985,Extensions,HONORING J.

639,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fellow Kansas Citian, and a man who has come to embody the ideals we share as a nation. As a player and coach for the Negro League's Kansas City Monarchs baseball team, as coach and scout for the present day Kansas City Royals, and as a community activist promoting reading and education to children, John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil has come to represent some of our most noble values: determination and dignity, humility and excellence. ``Buck'' has been a pioneer and trailblazer throughout his life and illustrious career, and demonstrates in his everyday actions and words that determination is the pathway to success. He is a role model for our children and a champion for our country.As a player, Buck had a career batting average of .288, including four .300-plus seasons at the plate, and led the Kansas City Monarchs to victory in the 1942 Negro World Series. After 12 years as a player, Buck changed hats and managed the Monarchs to four more league titles in six years. Following his career with the Kansas City Monarchs, Buck joined the major leagues as a scout for the Chicago Cubs. In 1962 the Chicago Cubs made him the first African-American to coach in the major Leagues. Buck is credited with signing hall of Fame Baseball greats Ernie Banks and Lou Brock to their first pro contracts, and is acknowledged to have sent more Negro League athletes to the all-white major leagues than any other man in baseball history.Buck is currently the Chairman for the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City and spends his time promoting the achievements of African-American baseball players who played for love of the game, despite being shut out of the majors because of the color of their skin. As a member of the 18-person Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee, he continues to tear down racial barriers by advancing deserving Negro Leaguers for induction to the Hall. In addition to his duties in Cooperstown and at the museum in Kansas City, Buck is finding new ways to enjoy life and share his wonderful exuberance. As a player, coach, scout, writer, and volunteer Buck represents a magnificent example to our generation and the next.Mr. Speaker, please join me in saluting John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil, a distinguished ambassador for baseball and symbol of African-American pride, a true hero for all of America, and a favorite son of Kansas City. Congratulations, Buck on the 1999 John Stanford Education Heroes Award. It is an honor to help celebrate your 88th birthday and demonstrate the Negro League's commitment to education through ``Reading Around the Bases.'' I salute you for your lifetime of achievement, and am both proud and honored to call you my friend. Thank you, Buck, for all you have done, and for all you continue to contribute to our lives.,2015-03-16 18:17:32.277061,2015-03-16 18:17:32.277061,Extensions,HONORING JOHN JORDAN ``BUCK'' O'NEIL ON HIS 88TH BIRTHDAY,1999-11-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-11-10/html/CREC-1999-11-10-pt1-PgE2336-3.htm,158,0,145,E2336-E2337,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri
640,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise to speak on another very important appropriations bill that has been addressed on this floor and is being considered. That is the debate on education in the Labor-HHS bill. We want to see that important bill moved forward, get passed and signed by the President.It is clear that the two sides of the aisle have very differing views on how we ought to go about improving education. Let us all agree that improving education should be our national priority. We on this side happen to think it is a local and State responsibility, but it is a national priority, the top national priority.Now, one side of the aisle trusts the Federal Government to make the decisions. The other side of the aisle, our side, trusts the parents and teachers, the school districts, the school board members, to make those decisions. This side of the aisle seems to base its decision on whether we are successful in education on the total dollars spent. Our side would judge success on academic achievement of students. This side of the aisle believes accountability comes in successfully filling out paperwork, jumping through the hoops that Washington lays out for school boards and teachers. Our side believes accountability is based on academic achievement.Our friends on the other side of the aisle believe that the Olympians on the Hill--Capitol Hill, that is--know what is best for the folks down in the valley. Our side believes that the great ideas, accomplishments, and actions occur on the local level and that the Olympians on the Hill should watch and learn.My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the Vice President talk a good game. Let me give you my view on what is going on. First, they have talked about the 100,000 teachers program, the school construction program. They have proposed to set aside billions of dollars for these programs alone and not allow flexibility that we strongly believe should be rested in the hands of the local schools, the parents who are served by them, and their children, and the people who run them.I support reduced class size. I campaigned for Governor on that basis. I know there are many school districts around the country that need new school buildings. However, as one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, I want to do the right thing. I agree with that. I know our children and parents and schools are counting on us, in my view, to get out of the way and let them do the job they are not only hired to do but they are dedicated to do.We saw in the first debate what happens when Washington tries to make decisions for what is best in local schools. Vice President Gore told a terrible tale about this young girl who had to stand up in class. After the debate, we found out that she had to stand up or she had to have a chair brought in for 1 day because they had $100,000 worth of new computers. The school superintendent said that getting a place for her to sit was not really the problem. I understand he mentioned something about school lunches in another school district, and very quickly some of the folks from that school district said that is not the problem at all. That is not to say--and I am not saying here--that the Vice President didn't hear real concerns, that he made them up.I am just saying: How are we here in Washington, how is the Federal bureaucracy, how is the Department of Education, and how are those of us who are sitting here in this room trying to make decisions for local schools all across the country supposed to know what the problems are in the Sarasota School or the Callaway County R-6 school in Missouri or a school district in California or a school district in Washington or a school district in Maine?There is a lot of talk about 100,000 new teachers. That proposal sounds good. It is a great slogan to use when you are trying to gain national headlines. But when you look at the formula, trying to find out whether it works, it doesn't work.I traveled around to school districts and talked to school boards and teachers and administrators. Let me tell you how that formula works in Missouri. The Gilliam C-4 School District would get $384; the Holliday C-2 School District would get $608; the Pleasant View R-VI School District would get $846.I first heard about this problem from a small school district when someone in that room said: We would get enough money for 11 percent of a teacher. One other person in the room said: We would get enough money for 17 percent of a teacher. They haven't quite figured out how to use 11 percent of a teacher or 17 percent of a teacher or how to spend $846 on a teacher.Over 175 school districts in the State of Missouri would receive less than $10,000 under this program. Surely you don't think they are going to be able to hire a teacher to reach that 100,000 new teacher goal for less than $10,000.Many of the schools have already addressed classroom size at the expense of other things.Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose giving them the flexibility to utilize these resources in another manner which may suit their needs but which doesn't fall into the dictates of the one-size-fits-all solution that Washington is being pushed to propose by the administration and by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.They are saying that we are not providing the school the resources to do what they need to do because Washington is trying to tell them what their priorities should be without knowing why that girl had to stand up or sit on a stool brought in for that one classroom.Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Vice President Gore advocate taking billions of dollars off the table for thousands of schools across the country. To me, the issue is simple. We must give our States and localities the flexibility to use the resources to improve our public education system and to make decisions at the local level.,2015-03-16 18:17:32.418190,2015-03-16 18:17:32.418190,Senate,DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT,2000-10-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/html/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgS10751-3.htm,132,9,146,S10751-S10769,B000611,mr. bond
641,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, as we meet today in commemoration of Black History month, I would like to comment on the historic battle for educational opportunity that continues to this day in the state of Missouri. The State of Missouri is proposing to end the 17-year-old school desegregation program that is finally, after more than a century of struggle, beginning to offer equal educational opportunity to black children in the city of St. Louis.It is almost impossible to comprehend the current controversy surrounding efforts to end St. Louis' successful voluntary school desegregation program without understanding the sad, sordid history of state imposed segregation in Missouri's public schools. In 1847 the Missouri Legislature outlawed teaching reading and writing to colored children. In fact, for the next 18 years it was a state felony for any person to teach blacks to read or write. The crime was considered so heinous that those who committed it were subject to six months in jail and a fine of $500. Fortunately, there were people of courage who stood up to this preposterous law.Catholics, Quakers and Unitarians, the First Baptist Church, St. Paul A.M.E. and Central Baptist and other colored churches conducted clandestine schools in underground locations. Catholic nuns at the Old Cathedral openly defied the law and taught Negro children. Six Sisters of Mercy defied the state government and opened a school for blacks in 1856.John Berry Meachum, a former slave, purchased his freedom and then saved enough money to buy a cooperage and boat supply company. He used his earnings to buy the freedom of many slaves and let them work for him until he was repaid. Meachum also became pastor of the First African Baptist Church. During the time that it was illegal to teach blacks to read and write, he operated covert classrooms on boats moored to a sandbar on the Mississippi River. When Meachum's boat schools were discovered, he built a steamboat, equipped with a library, and transported black children and illiterate adults to the middle of the Mississippi River where federal law prevailed. There blacks were taught to read, write and add numbers. His floating school continued until his death.Despite, the heroic and valiant efforts of a few, the state government was determined to keep the black citizens of Missouri illiterate and uneducated. In 1865 the Missouri Constitution stated: ``Separate schools may be established for children of African descent. All funds provided for the support of public schools shall be appropriated in proportion to the number of children without regard to color.'' The following year the City of St. Louis opened its first school for blacks. This was 28 years after the City had opened its first school for whites. In that era more than 120,000 blacks lived in Missouri and according to the 1865 report of Superintendent Ira Divoli, colored property owners paid taxes on between two and three million pieces of property.In 1889, the Missouri Legislature enacted a law mandating separate schools ``for the children of African descent.'' A year later, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the statute and in its unanimous decision declared that ``colored carries with it natural race peculiarities'' justifying the separation of blacks and whites. Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court in Plessy V. Ferguson declared segregated education the law of the land and ruled that ``separate but equal facilities were legal.'' As ``separate'' became the edict, ``unequal'' became the standard for black tax-supported education throughout the nation and the state of Missouri.For nearly 80 years after the historic Plessy V. Ferguson decision, the public schools in Missouri were legally segregated institutions of opportunity for white students and ill-equipped, underfunded dungeons of disgrace for black children who were provided an absolutely inferior education. In 1972, a class action suit was filed alleging segregation in the City's public school system. But, in 1979, the federal district court ruled that the St. Louis Board of Education had not violated the Constitution's ``equal protection'' provisions.Finally, in 1980, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recognized the plight of black children and overruled the 1979 decision. The lower federal court then issued an order allowing busing of children for the purpose of desegregating St. Louis' public schools.Since 1980, more than $100 million has been expended to improve the all-black schools in St. Louis and to assist the St. Louis County suburban schools which serve inner city children. Those who now condemn seventeen years as too long and assert that the expenditure of public funds has been too extravagant, need to familiarize themselves with the long and costly history of mis-education of blacks and the role played by the State of Missouri in this long, sad story.I suggest that critics of the St. Louis school desegregation program compare what the State of Missouri spent in dollars and cents to deny black children an equal education with the amount that is now being expended to equalize educational opportunity. It is hardly the time to decry the cost of school desegregation as excessive and wasteful.Under the court-approved plan each year, 13,000 black children from St. Louis attend public schools in the suburban districts of St. Louis County in the largest voluntary metropolitan desegregation program in the nation. White children from the County attend magnet schools in St. Louis and substantial funds are devoted to early grade reading programs and other educational improvement efforts in St. Louis. These thirteen thousand black students voluntarily board buses in the inner-city each school day and go to the suburban school districts where they learn in an integrated atmosphere alongside middle class white students. These poor black children fit into the latest national study showing that poor children attending predominantly middle class schools do much better than their counterparts who go to school with mostly poor children. And, the record reveals that the 13,000 inner-city students attending integrated and magnet schools in middle class neighborhoods are graduating from high school at twice the rate of students attending all black schools in the inner city.These 13,000 St. Louis school children may be, at long last, ending one of the ugliest chapters in the history of the State of Missouri. Yet, unbelievably, some state leaders are rushing to dismantle their classrooms.Mr. Speaker, Black History Month was established to inspire all people to learn a little more about the history of Black Americans. It is a history that Blacks were once denied the opportunity to learn by the power of the state. Those who do not comprehend this are conspiring to gamble away our future.,2015-03-16 18:17:32.679349,2015-03-16 18:17:32.679349,Extensions,1998 CONGRESSIONAL OBSERVANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH,1998-02-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-02-24/html/CREC-1998-02-24-pt1-PgE196-2.htm,14,0,144,E196,C000488,mr. clay
642,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Mr. President, for years, America's charities and churches have been transforming shattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. By contrast, government social programs have failed miserably in moving recipients from dependency and despair to responsibility and independence.Successful faith-based organizations now have a new opportunity to transform the character of our welfare system under the ``Charitable Choice'' provision contained in the 1996 welfare reform law. Charitable Choice allows--but does not require--states to contract with charitable, religious or private organizations, or to create voucher systems, to deliver welfare services within the states. The provision requires states to consider these organizations on an equal basis with other private groups once a state decides to use nongovernmental organizations.The Charitable Choice legislation provides specific protections for religious organizations when they provide services. For example, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on the basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based organization retains its independence from government, including control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs.Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious organizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their employment decisions.The Charitable Choice legislation also provides specific protections to beneficiaries of assistance. A religious organization can't discriminate against a beneficiary on account of religion. And if a beneficiary objects to receiving services from a religious organization, he or she has a right to an alternate provider.Finally, there is a limitation on use of government funds. Federal contract dollars cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.I would like to give a couple of examples of how the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare law is currently working.Last fall, Payne Memorial Outreach Center, the non-profit community development arm of the 100-year-old Payne Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Baltimore, received a $1.5 million state contract to launch an innovative job training and placement program. In a matter of only five months, over 100 welfare recipients successfully obtained employment through their participation in Payne's program. A brochure from this dynamic faith-based institution describes why Payne is successful: ``The Intensive Job Service Program reaches out in love to Baltimore's most disenfranchised, helping them to identify and strengthen their God-given talents--releasing and developing their human possibilities.''Another example of Charitable Choice at work is in Shreveport, Louisiana, where the ``Faith and Families'' program, under a contract with the state, is running a successful job placement program. Faith and Families offers job-readiness classes in northwestern Louisiana, helps set up job interviews, and opens doors into the workplace.The program also links welfare families with faith communities. Churches are asked to adopt a family and provide assistance--possibly child care, transportation, work experience, tutoring, and encouragement--that will help them make the transition from welfare to work.I spoke with the director of Faith and Families in Shreveport just last week, and he told me that his organization has helped 400 people get off welfare and find jobs.These examples demonstrate that under the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare law, caring, faith-based organizations are providing effective services that help individuals move from dependency to independence, from despair to dignity.With this in mind, today I am introducing ``The Charitable Choice Expansion Act of 1998,'' which expands the Charitable Choice concept to all federal laws which authorize the government to use non-governmental entities to provide services to beneficiaries with federal dollars.The substance of the Charitable Choice Expansion Act is virtually identical to that of the original Charitable Choice provision of the welfare reform law. The only real difference between the two provisions is that the new bill covers many more federal programs than the original provision.While the original Charitable Choice provision applies mainly to the new welfare reform block grant program, the Charitable Choice Expansion Act applies to all federal government programs in which the government is authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide federally funded services to beneficiaries. Some of the programs that will be covered include: housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, juvenile services, seniors services, the Community Development Block Grant, the Community Services Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, abstinence education, and child welfare services.The legislation does not cover elementary and secondary education programs--except it does cover GED programs--or higher education programs. Further, the bill does not affect the Head Start program or the Child Care Development Block Grant program, both of which already contain certain provisions regarding the use of religious organizations in delivering services under those programs.We have taken measures to strengthen the bill by providing more protections to both beneficiaries and religious organizations. For example, the government must ensure that beneficiaries receive notice of their right under the bill to object to receiving services from a religious organization. Additionally, religious organizations must segregate their own private funds from government funding.This proposal is necessary because while some areas of the law may not contain discriminatory language towards religious organizations, many government officials may assume wrongly that the Establishment Clause bars religious organizations from participating as private providers.The Charitable Choice Expansion Act embodies existing case precedents to clarify to government officials and religious organizations alike that it is constitutionally allowable, and even constitutionally required, to consider religious organizations on an equal basis with other private providers. It is my hope that these protections in the law will encourage successful charitable and faith-based organizations to expand their services while assuring them that they will not have to extinguish their religious character when receiving government funds.I am pleased to say that there is broad-based support for the Charitable Choice Expansion Act. Some of the organizations supporting the concept of this legislation include Agudath Israel, American Center for Law and Justice, Call to Renewal, Center for Public Justice, Christian Coalition, Christian Legal Society, the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education, National Association of Evangelicals, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the Salvation Army, Teen Challenge International USA, and World Vision.America's faith-based charities and nongovernmental organizations, from the Salvation Army to Catholic Charities, have moved people successfully from dependency and despair to the dignity of self-reliance. Government alone will never cure our societal ills. We need to find ways to help unleash the cultural remedy administered so effectively by charitable and religious organizations. Allowing a ``charitable choice'' will help transform the lives of those in need and unleash an effective response to today's challenges in our culture.

643,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Ms. Paula Smith, a trail-blazing business woman and beloved member of the St. Louis community, who recently passed, on January 28, 2010, at 76. Ms. Smith devoted over 30 years of her life to public service and worked tirelessly to better the lives of those around her.At the age of 16, Ms. Smith dropped out of high school, but she later earned a high school equivalency diploma and then went on to receive a degree in economics from Washington University. Ms. Smith's education did not end here; she earned a master's in business administration from St. Louis University and did graduate work at Harvard. Ms. Smith's dedication to her education was a testament to her entrepreneurial spirit and allowed her to contribute to the St. Louis community, as well as to society as a whole.Ms. Smith's career in public service began in 1981, when then Governor Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond appointed her director of the state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. At that time she was the only woman and the only African-American in the Governor's cabinet. Throughout her career Ms. Smith broke barriers and defied expectations, proving to those around her that she was capable of making an impact in the most profound way.After serving the Governor for several years Ms. Smith was summoned to Washington by President Ronald Reagan to run the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. In 1990 Ms. Smith returned to St. Louis and started her own business: she opened a consulting company and used her years of experience in Washington and as an employee of Kit Bond to make a difference in St. Louis.Throughout her life Ms. Smith demonstrated a commitment to improving life for those around her; she strove for social justice and fought to ensure equality for all. She was passionate about her civic and philanthropic work and determined to make a profound impact in her own community. Ms. Smith's powerful legacy lives on through her three children. Her daughter, Cheryl Walker of St. Louis, is now a lawyer and her two sons, Dwayne and Dwight Bosman, are both well-known jazz musicians.Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Ms. Smith; a woman who always strove to make a difference and succeeded. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Paula Smith, an amazing woman whose legacy will forever be remembered. I extend my sincerest condolences to her family and friends.

644,MO,Todd,Akin,R,You know, the thing that was interesting to me, about December of last year there was a guy who is one cool businessman, he is the CEO of Emerson Electric--which is not a big household name to a lot of people, but Emerson is a gigantic manufacturing company headquartered in St. Louis with operations in countries all over the globe. And this guy was a little bit--I won't say it was a rant, but he was fired up. He said, Look, I think I know something about job creation. And he went back over the record of that company and all of the jobs that had been created and how profitable they were and what they were doing in manufacturing. They have all kinds of really high-tech kinds of things like the electronic controls that control different businesses and huge complicated process industry and things like that, a lot of very sophisticated stuff. They have all of these jobs they have created through all of these years.So this guy is the CEO of this place. He has come up through the ranks. He is an engineer; he knows what it takes to make a company work. And he says, I'll tell you what, with what's being done in this country I can guarantee you we won't be creating jobs in America. We'll create jobs--we're going to create them in foreign countries because the foreign countries aren't doing this crazy stuff. We can put the jobs there and make a decent profit. Essentially what he's saying is the U.S. Government is forcing us not to make jobs and to do all our job creation overseas.Now, that's a tragedy; that's a tragedy. And he was shook up about it. He was upset about it because he's an American; he loves this country. He wants the jobs to be made here. But, no, we're going to do this socialized medicine gig, which has never worked in any country of the world. I mean, at a minimum, we could learn from the former Soviet Union. They had the theory that the government should provide you a job and health care and an education and food and a place to live. That's what their theory was, and it didn't work worth a crud and the Soviet Union collapsed. And so what are we doing? Well, the government is going to provide you now with education and food and housing--and health care, of course.I yield.,2015-03-16 18:17:33.208723,2015-03-16 18:17:33.208723,House,THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY,2010-04-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-04-21/html/CREC-2010-04-21-pt1-PgH2779-12.htm,57,21,156,H2779-H2786,A000358,mr. akin
645,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Marvin Teer, Sr., a valued member of the St. Louis community. Mr. Teer passed away on May 27, 2010, at the age of 93. His efforts greatly enriched the city of St. Louis, and his legacy will continue to inspire his residents for years to come.Mr. Teer grew up against a backdrop of adversity and racial tension. He was born in Meridian, Mississippi, and at the tender age of 5, his family suffered the tragic loss of Mr. Teer's uncle, who was lynched. Mr. Teer's parents moved the family to East St. Louis in search of new opportunities for themselves and their children. Mr. Teer took full advantage of those opportunities, graduating from Lincoln Senior High School and going on to earn his bachelor's degree in education and two master's degrees, one in education and another in administration.In World War II, he fought courageously in the Army, which was at that time segregated. He rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant, where he worked to secure equal resources and equal respect for his fellow black soldiers.Louis in 1946 to teach history and urban studies at Lincoln Senior High School and later Vashon High School. Being a dedicated teacher, he shared his knowledge and energy with students for a full 30 years.Louis, and that commitment to his city extended far beyond his position as a teacher. Mr. Teer participated in a diverse array of city organizations, including the Metropolitan Youth Commission, the St. Louis Board of Equalization, the Board of Building Appeals, and the St. Louis Area Agency on Aging.Upon his retirement, Mr. Teer directed his enthusiasm for serving his community toward the goal of providing transportation to the seniors of St. Louis. He co-founded Available Citywide Transportation, which grew from one van to a fleet of 43 under his watch.Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Mr. Teer, a citizen whose commitment to his community was a testament to Missouri and to America.

646,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, today, as Women's History Month comes to a close it is a good time to reflect on the many accomplishments women have been part of and to address what needs to be done further to fully carry out equality for all and get our economy back on track.As we experience the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression we will need the leadership of all Americans including strong leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was the first woman chosen as Speaker by her colleagues and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who ran an historic campaign for the presidency. Both who have broken and shattered the glass ceiling have demonstrated remarkable accomplishment the nation can be confident in during these tough times.This nation has faced multiple challenges that we have faced with the help of strong women. And today many women face challenges of succeeding in the workplace, caring for their family including their aging parents. I am proud of the work this Congress has done in a short amount of time for American working women.It is telling that President Barack Obama's first bill signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that reverses a Supreme Court ruling that made it more difficult for Americans to pursue pay discrimination claims. At a time when too many workers are seeing their jobs and wages slashed, we've got to make sure that all Americans are paid fairly for their hard work.Congress has also passed significant tax cuts for working women and major investments in health care. To help get us out of this economic mess we also created thousands of jobs where women have new opportunities including contracting opportunities and the availability of small business loans.Speaker Pelosi said it best: ``Women want what men want: an equal opportunity to succeed, a safe and prosperous America, good paying jobs, better access to affordable health care, and the best possible education for our children.''President Obama and this Congress have made progress with all those issues in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and will continue to build upon those accomplishments with the passage of the President's budget blueprint, which makes investments in health care, energy and education--all intended to create jobs.,2015-03-16 18:17:33.523949,2015-03-16 18:17:33.523949,Extensions,WOMEN ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY,2009-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-31/html/CREC-2009-03-31-pt1-PgE831.htm,54,0,155,E831,C001060,mr. carnahan
647,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Reclaiming my time, it does my heart a great deal of sadness to see my friend from Texas without a little bit of a twinkle in his eye, which is so commonly there. But this is a very serious subject. We try not to yell and scream too much about it, but we know that economically what's being done is going to harm our constituents. It's getting rid of jobs. It's making the small businessman have to basically shutter down and to keep his operation small, which is exactly the wrong thing for what we should be doing.And why is it that we need all of this money? That is the question that I think we need to be asking. Why is it that we have to be spending all this money on government programs? And the answer seems to me to be, again, we're not learning very well from history. Just bear with me for a second. I'd like to get your perspective on this.A certain number of years ago, there was a thing called the Soviet Union, and they were bad guys. And they were a bunch communists and they were socialists. And what was it that they thought? They thought the job of the government should be to provide you, first of all, with a job, and then they wanted the government to give you health care and food and housing and an education. And one thing particular about them, they didn't want you to talk about God ever.Now, in our country, let's see, we've got all this government spending going on so the government can provide you with health care and a job and food and housing and an education and it's politically correct not to talk about God because if you did that, gentlemen, you'd realize your rights come from God.

649,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor two men who have spent many years serving their community in Springfield, Missouri, as charter members of the Board of Trustees of the Ozarks Technical Community College. Frank Farmer and Don Wessel both enjoyed long and distinguished careers in private business before being selected by their neighbors to serve on the newly created Board of Trustees, following the creation of the school in April 1990. They have each been reelected to consecutive terms since then; at the end of this month, both men will be ending their tenure of service.Farmer and Wessel helped shape the growth and direction of a school that serves the students of 13 public school districts in southwest Missouri--and far beyond that. The growth of the school has been nothing short of a phenomenon, with enrollment this year topping more than 10,000 students. OTC, as it is known to many local students and residents, is also moving forward on plans to expand its operation to a second campus in Ozark, Missouri, with an eye on affording greater accessibility to its growing student body.From its modest beginnings in central Springfield at the old vocational-technical school, OTC has blossomed into a modern campus that has helped revitalized center Springfield and help train its local youth.From the beginning, Farmer and Wessel led the way in developing the infrastructure and educational leadership OTC would depend upon for its spectacular growth. First they hired an effective president in Norman Myers. The board of trustees, led by president Wessel from 1992 to 1994 and Farmer from 1994 to 1996, embarked on a plan to build new classroom buildings and greatly expand the number and diversity of available courses available to students.Farmer's background in education includes service on the Willard Board of Education, on which he also served as president. Journalist, author and dairyman, Farmer has lent his experience and expertise to several public boards and charities, while attending to his duties as the editorial page editor of the Springfield News-Leader before his retirement there.Wessel is a well-known car dealer and philanthropist, who has been active in the Springfield Chamber of Commerce, American Red Cross, Cox Medical Centers, and has served on virtually every public and civic board in the Springfield area.To Mr. Farmer and Mr. Wessel, I wish to extend a heartfelt ``thank you and well done'' for their untiring work over the last two decades.

650,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I inform the House of the death of Dr. Benedict K. Zobrist, the former director of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library.Dr. Zobrist was born in Moline, Illinois, on August 21, 1921, son of Benedict and Lila A. Colson Zobrist. He graduated from Moline High School in 1939 and went on to attend Augustana College, but left his studies to join the United States Army in 1942. After serving in World War II and upon discharge from active duty, he returned to complete his college studies. It was at Augustana College that he met Donna Anderson, his future wife. Benedict graduated in 1946 with a bachelor's degree in history and began graduate school at Stanford University. However, he returned to the Midwest to be closer to Donna and on October 23, 1948, they were united in marriage.Dr. Zobrist resumed his studies at Northwestern University, earning both a master's degree (1948) and a doctor of philosophy degree (1953) in history. After completing his education, Dr. Zobrist joined the staff of Augustana College, where he became a full-time faculty member in 1960. In 1962, he won a Fulbright Fellowship and studied at Tunghai University in Taichung, Taiwan. He also pursued advanced studies at the East Asia Institute at Columbia University in New York in 1962-63. Dr. Zobrist moved to Missouri in 1969 to join the staff of the Truman Library in Independence; he became director shortly thereafter. He worked diligently to expand the collections of the library, traveling from coast to coast to meet with members of the Truman administration, as well as other significant figures of that period. Zobrist expanded the work of the Harry S. Truman Library Institute, the not-for-profit foundation associated with the library. He went on to charter a course for the expansion of the Institute's education efforts and its support of the library's operations within the National Archive system. Dr. Zobrist was most proud of instituting ``Truman Week'', a week long annual celebration held around President Truman's May 8th birthday.Dr. Zobrist maintained his affiliation with the United States Army as a reservist, and retired as lieutenant colonel. He spent many summers on active duty with the Office of the Chief of Military History in Washington, DC,; he also served as a faculty member at the Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, and the Army Intelligence School, Fort Bragg.Madam Speaker, I know the members of the House will join me in extending heartfelt condolences to Donna Anderson Zobrist and their three sons: Karl, Mark, and Erik.,2015-03-16 18:17:34.185419,2015-03-16 18:17:34.185419,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF DR.

651,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, today I am proud to honor Betty Jean Kerr as she celebrates 30 years of successful service as CEO of People's Health Centers, PHC. Under her dedicated leadership, the medically underserved and uninsured receive comprehensive medical treatment daily across the St. Louis Metropolitan Area. The St. Louis community will celebrate Ms. Kerr during a very special Gala Weekend, which includes a historical renaming of PHC to the Betty Jean Kerr People's Health Centers. This is a fitting tribute for an extraordinary woman who has been credited with taking her vision of community health to an international level.PHC Health Centers, PHC, has a 35 year history of providing essential primary care and prevention health education risk reduction services. Under Kerr's leadership, the PHC campus is now a sprawling community of apartments for the elderly, housing for persons with disabilities, social security services, primary health care, dental services, a pharmacy, affordable homes, small businesses, and school-based sites that provide increased access to health in conjunction with health center locations. All health services are provided by clinicians who are accountable for addressing the personal health needs of the residents in St. Louis. The success of PHC is a true reflection of Kerr's commitment and dedication to ensuring that primary care and prevention services are efficiently provided, regardless of a patient's socioeconomic status.Kerr has also ventured beyond medical treatment by incorporating medical research into PHC. By partnering with government agencies, teaching institutions, and a host of other participants, PHC is able to conduct clinical research trials in an effort to improve health outcomes for medically underserved persons with chronic diseases. And reduce health disparities. Ms. Kerr has a strong belief that every citizen has the right to a long and healthy life. She continues creating unique programs, such as the Sharing the Care Program, which allows eligible PHC participants to receive life-saving drugs free of charge.Kerr has recently extended her mission of serving the underserved through the Betty Jean Kerr Scholarship. These College Family Life Assistant Scholarships are awarded to African American students with an interest in higher education in the fields of health and health related professions.Madam Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Betty Jean Kerr today before Congress.

General Lord is retiring after serving in our nation's Air Force with distinction for over 37 years.General Lord received a Bachelor of Science in education from Otterbein College in Ohio, where he entered the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program. He earned a Master's degree in industrial management from the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks. He also attended the Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College, and the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base.After entering the Air Force in 1969, General Lord served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty. He was the Director of the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in West Germany and he was the Commander of two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. At Vandenberg Air Force Base in California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He led Air Force Education as the Commander of Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base and was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff for the Headquarters U.S. Air Force. Since 2002, General Lord has been the Commander of the Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, where he has been responsible for the development, acquisition, and operation of the Air Force's space and missile systems.General Lord has earned numerous decorations and badges for his outstanding efforts in the military.

653,MO,Kenny,Hulshof,R,Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I rise today in opposition to the rule before us.The ethics process in this body is broken. In all candor, there is plenty of blame to go around as to why we find ourselves in this situation. We undermine the public's faith in this great institution when we let petty politics erode the very processes meant to preserve the public's trust in Congress.I have met with the Majority Leader on this issue, and I sincerely believe that he has a genuine desire to have an effective, functioning Ethics process in the House. I thank him for his willingness to listen, and I hope we can perhaps address this issue in the future.Having previously served on the Ethics Committee, I firmly believe that the ethics process can work. For the sake of this institution--it must work. And as we begin consideration of the Leadership's ethics and lobby reform package, I will say there are some provisions in the base bill before us that should ultimately be adopted--earmark reform, denying Congressional pensions to convicted felons, enhanced disclosure and improved ethics education are common-sense proposals that I would hope that we can all support.That being said, I cannot support this rule. Ethics reform is incomplete absent changes to improve the enforcement of House rules. My colleague Joel Hefley and I have put forward legislation to strengthen the ability of the Ethics Committee to dispense with ethics matters by expediting the review of these issues and insulating committee members and non-partisan staff from the political pressures that can pollute the ethics process. We do this by giving the Chair and Ranking Member on the committee subpoena power earlier in the investigative process and prohibiting the arbitrary dismissal of Members and technical staff. We also require ethics education for Members and staff, and we dramatically improve disclosure associated with gifts and travel. All of these common-sense reforms would greatly improve the ethics process in the House.We sought to offer our legislation as an amendment to the bill we are to consider today. This proposal was not made in order under the rule. Thus, we are faced with the prospect of passing an incomplete ethics reform package that lacks enhanced enforcement.I think this is a mistake, and for this reason, I must reluctantly oppose this rule.,2015-03-16 18:18:30.978788,2015-03-16 18:18:30.978788,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4975, LOBBYING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2006,2006-04-27,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-04-27/html/CREC-2006-04-27-pt1-PgH1877-7.htm,48,87,152,H1877-H1886,H000948,mr. hulshof

This bill will extend funding through fiscal year 2011 for children's hospitals that provide approved graduate medical residency programs. Hippocrates once said, ``Healing is a matter of time, but is sometimes a matter of opportunity.'' Kansas City's Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics continue to provide numerous opportunities for the children of Missouri and Kansas to receive the best pediatric healthcare available. The services Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) provides are invaluable. The $7 million received by Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area trains 125 interns and residents from the University of Missouri-Kansas City Medical School each year. The CHGME program ensures that children will continue to receive excellent healthcare and our Nation's pediatric health workforce will remain strong and competitive for years to come.Since Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City is the only children's hospital between St. Louis, Missouri and Denver, Colorado, I know it is essential to continue to provide this vital funding. These valuable funds will keep the hospitals running efficiently while training our future pediatric care providers. I will support the restoration of CHGME's full funding for $300 million when the House considers the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2007.Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics provide services spanning from Wichita, Kansas to Springfield, Missouri, and the passage of H.R. 5574 will ensure on-going financial support for over 60 children's hospitals, including Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City where the program started. From heart surgery to brain tumors to burn treatment, patients at Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics know they are receiving the best medical care possible and parents will never forget the ``angels'' who saved their children's lives. I am proud to support a program that has improved the lives of countless children nationwide, especially in my district, Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, while also expressing gratitude to the Missouri and Kansas delegation for their unending support.Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing our pleasure at the passage of this bill, and also to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City for providing such a valuable service to so many families. The residents of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District take comfort in knowing the medical experts up at Children's Mercy Hospital are constantly on call ensure our children's well being.

Dr. Elster also held positions as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower, Acting Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Resource Management and Support.Dr. Elster was recognized for meritorious civilian service as Provost and Academic Dean at the Naval Postgraduate School, from July 1995 to December 2005. Because of his leadership, the Naval Postgraduate School attained unprecedented stature in the defense establishment and the academic community. It was recognized in 2005 with the highest score for military value of all Department of Defense education commands by the Education and Training Joint Cross Service Group.The Naval Postgraduate School is respected as a world class research university due in part to Dr. Elster's leadership, strategic vision, and devotion to public service. Much of the academic work of the school's students and faculty responds directly to real world defense mission needs.As Dr. Richard S. Elster prepares for retirement, I know the Members of the House will join me in expressing appreciation for his dedication to the Naval Postgraduate School and will wish him well in all the days ahead.,2015-03-16 18:18:31.350057,2015-03-16 18:18:31.350057,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RICHARD S.

656,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay honor to an institution celebrating its centennial milestone this month. College of the Ozarks is an institution of higher learning that for many years was known as ``The School that Runs on Faith.'' This small Christian college, located in the hills near Branson and Hollister, Missouri, has seen its share of struggle and triumphs. But central to the College is its mission of providing a Christian education to young people from the Ozarks who are deserving, yet financially unable to procure such training.Originally, the purpose of The School of the Ozarks, also known by its students and graduates as ``Hardwork U,'' was to provide an opportunity for a high school education. This mission was pursued without significant change until 1956, when The School of the Ozarks added 2 years of junior college to the 4-year high school program. This format continued until 1964 when the Board of Trustees and the faculty voted to expand the 2-year program into a 4-year liberal arts program. The 4-year college program of The School of the Ozarks began classes for juniors in September 1965. In 1990, the Board of Trustees approved changing the operating name of The School of the Ozarks to ``College of the Ozarks.''The distinctive tradition of the work program and the College's commitment to its five-fold mission of academic, spiritual, cultural, vocational, and patriotic growth in its students has attracted and continues to attract famous guests, including U.S. Presidents and First Ladies, U.S. Commanding Generals, Prime Ministers, and other dignitaries who recognize its uniqueness. Today, the College offers degrees in 34 academic areas, and student enrollment is approximately 1,400.More than ever, our country needs young men and women with these values to serve as leaders. Dr. R. M. Good, who led the school during the Depression years once said, ``Investments in humanity bring substantial and sure dividends.'' This is why the College has a renewed commitment this centennial year to continue its worthy, distinct mission--a tradition that works. It is these things--a respect for and appreciation of our roots and work tradition, as well as the prospect of a promising future--that College of the Ozarks will celebrate throughout its centennial year.I want to wish College of the Ozarks another 100 years of service to the region, educating and inspiring students with a curriculum that emphasizes character, faith and excellence.,2015-03-16 18:18:31.489151,2015-03-16 18:18:31.489151,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLLEGE OF THE OZARKS,2006-11-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-11-15/html/CREC-2006-11-15-pt1-PgE2052.htm,129,0,152,E2052,B000575,mr. blunt
657,MO,Todd,Akin,R,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, a resolution recognizing the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME, on the occasion of its 125th anniversary.125 years ago, a group of prominent mechanical engineers gathered in the New York offices of the ``American Machinist'' to form what ultimately became ASME, one of the premier professional engineering organizations for technical education and research issues. Since 1880, ASME has worked to advance technological knowledge and facilitate the transfer of information from research to application.Significant among ASME's many achievements is its efforts to improve the safety and reliability of equipment, especially boilers. In the year that ASME was founded, nearly 160 boiler explosions occurred in the U.S., each of which brought death and injury. During this period of industrial growth, boilers were becoming larger, more numerous and dangerous.On March 10, 1905, a boiler explosion at the Brockton Shoe Factory resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries and completely leveled the factory. Terrible accidents like Brockton drove the creation of ASME's comprehensive Boiler Code, a set of standards to ensure the reliability and predictability of machine design and production. Quickly adopted by most States, this code virtually eliminated boiler explosions in the United States.Today, ASME has thousands of volunteers working on committees that combine to issue more than 600 standards, ensuring proper specifications for a wide range of manufactured items. From the pressure valve of boilers to the threads on a screw, these standards ensure that equipment fits and holds safely, protecting American workers and the general public.Some of our most prominent Americans have helped found ASME and many of our greatest innovators have occupied its board. Many will recognize the names of such members as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and George Westinghouse.ASME continues this proud tradition more than a century later, engaging men and women of substance in emerging and future technical fields and cultivating the next generation of industrial leaders. In fact, ASME fellows can be found in the Halls of Congress and throughout the administration, providing valuable insight on legislation, regulation, and policies related to technology and the practice of engineering. The ASME members are tireless advocates for quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education for students of all ages.For 125 years of service to the U.S., I want to extend my warmest and heartfelt congratulations and sincere appreciation to President Harry Armen and the members of ASME for their strong and inspired leadership. I look forward to our continued association and future ASME achievements.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:18:31.624247,2015-03-16 18:18:31.624247,House,CONGRATULATING ASME ON THEIR 125TH ANNIVERSARY,2005-03-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-03-02/html/CREC-2005-03-02-pt1-PgH852-6.htm,22,6,151,H852-H854,A000358,mr. akin
658,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that I inform the House of the death of Dr. David Henson of Jefferson City, Missouri.Dr. Henson grew up in Orlando, Florida. He attended Florida A&amp;M University where he received a B.S. degree in Biology in 1961. In 1968, he earned a M.Sc.Ed. degree in Chemistry from Tuskegee University. In 1972, Dr. Henson received his Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry from the University of Iowa.For more than two decades Dr. Henson made significant contributions to the field of higher education. Most notably, he was the Acting Chairperson, Department of Biochemistry, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, and Associate Professor of Biochemistry at Howard University College of Medicine; Dean of Student Affairs, Associate Dean of Yale College, Lecturer in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and Fellow in Timothy Dwight College at Yale University; Provost and Professor of Chemistry at the Broward Campus of Florida Atlantic University and Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Services/Student Support Services at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Dr. Henson also served as President and Professor of Chemistry at Alabama A&amp;M University in Huntsville, Alabama, and as Vice President of Student Services at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. On July 2, 1997, Dr. Henson became the seventeenth President of Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri. Under his leadership Lincoln University experienced unprecedented growth and renewal.Dr. Henson also was involved in the Jefferson City community. He served on the Board of Directors for the Jefferson City Chamber of Commerce, was a member of the Jefferson City Leadership Forum and the Rotary Club of Jefferson City.Dr. Henson was a member of Sigma XI Honorary Society, Beta Kappa Chi Scientific Honorary Society, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., and an Honorary Member of Kappa Kappa Psi Band Organization.

659,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member from Connecticut for yielding me time.Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution honoring the late Senator Paul Simon. It was my privilege to have known Senator Simon for most of my life. I have fond memories of watching Congressman Simon on the House floor many years ago when I was a student and a doorkeeper, and he has long been a source of personal inspiration.When I first came to know Congressman Simon, he represented Southern Illinois and served with my father on the House Committee on Education and Labor. He was among the most active and effective Members in the history of this institution, and I was not surprised when I recently learned that in 1983, Time Magazine cited Congressman Simon for passing more amendments than any other Member of the U.S. House of Representatives.Paul Simon served in the Illinois House of Representatives, the Illinois Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Throughout his career, Paul Simon was famous for championing the causes of working people, children, the disabled and veterans. When he served in the Illinois legislature, he helped to create the State's community college system and the Illinois Arts Council. He also won the Independent Voters of Illinois Best Legislator Award every session in which he served.While serving in the U.S. Congress, Paul Simon sponsored the Missing Children Act and the legislation establishing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He also wrote the National Literacy Act, the School to Work Opportunities Act and the Job Training Partnership Act amendments. He was a leader in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the establishment of the direct college loan program.Deeply dedicated to the community that sent him to represent their interests in Washington, Senator Simon held more town hall meetings than any other Illinois senator and his office was legendary for its constituent services.While in Congress, Paul Simon worked to enact legislation designating the first five federally chartered future high-speed rail corridors, which included the St. Louis-Chicago-Detroit/Milwaukee corridor, and to designate the Illinois-Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor. He was also instrumental in expanding the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, which is St. Louis's Gateway Arch National Park, to the State of Illinois.He possessed a rare knowledge and understanding of the legislative process and manifested an extraordinary energy for public policy-making.Senator Simon left us all way too soon. He lived a life dedicated to serving others, and he certainly left this world a better place for his time on Earth.,2015-03-16 18:18:32.044552,2015-03-16 18:18:32.044552,House,AGREEING WITH THE SENTIMENT OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PAUL SIMON,2004-01-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-01-21/html/CREC-2004-01-21-pt1-PgH52.htm,2,16,150,H52-H57,C001049,mr. clay
660,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Doris Dunlap Darden, an educator who has devoted 50 years of service to the St. Louis Public School District. She has dedicated her life to enabling children to attain quality education and providing opportunities that help students realize their abilities and achieve their highest goals.She began her commendable teaching career in 1953 and has worked diligently to level the educational playing field for at-risk youth in low-income neighborhoods throughout the city of St. Louis. Darden has encouraged hundreds of children by setting high expectations and implementing programs for students to gain leadership and communications skills necessary to succeed in life. She has been committed to reaching both the students and their parents with her educational outreach. Darden impressively took the initiative to create ``Home, School and Community,'' a program which introduced students to local and national newsmakers and celebrities. This innovative program allows famous guest speakers to encourage students to achieve academic excellence, while their parents attended informative workshops and seminars.Darden solidly believes that all children deserve a high quality education regardless of their socioeconomic status. As a tutor, early in her career, she took note of the way wealthy parents trained their children and introduced those same learning techniques to inner city students. Darden found that her efforts helped raise both the productivity level and esteem of children who would otherwise might have been cast off by society.In addition to her unwavering commitment to teaching, Darden has selflessly allotted time for community service. She had dedicated numerous hours to working with the Colored Women's Association, National Association of University Women, Tot's N' Teens, various city-wide committees and Leadership for Teachers.Mr. Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Doris Dunlap Darden to today before Congress. This extraordinary women strongly believes that every child has the capacity to learn and deserves a chance to express that capacity through life goals. In 50 years, Darden has influentially touched the lives of thousands of young people in classrooms and throughout the St. Louis community. She has a stellar record of demonstrating compassion in the classroom. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring a treasured member of the St. Louis community, Doris Dunlap Darden.,2015-03-16 18:18:32.195653,2015-03-16 18:18:32.195653,Extensions,FOR THE LOVE OF TEACHING--A TRIBUTE TO REMARKABLE DORIS DUNLAP DARDEN,2003-02-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-02-25/html/CREC-2003-02-25-pt1-PgE283-2.htm,30,0,149,E283,C001049,mr. clay
661,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, today I would like to commend the Guadalupe Center Inc. for their continued commitment to improving the life of Latinos throughout Kansas City, MO.The Guadalupe Center began as a volunteer school and well baby clinic for Mexican immigrants in Kansas City's Westside in 1919, becoming one of the Nation's first social service agencies for Latinos in the United States.Once working out of the rectory of Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine on West 23rd Street, the Guadalupe Center now has nine buildings and has expanded to serve the entire Kansas City Metropolitan Latino community.Today, the Center provides a number of essential services and is a leading advocate for the Latino community.Health programs at the center include substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS education and counseling. The center's diligent work in reaching this disproportionately affected Latino population is to be congratulated and encouraged.Also, the center has had a great deal of success with increasing employment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in the Latino community. This success goes hand in hand with the center's constantly expanding education programs, which provide participants with a number of opportunities, including second language GED and job training skills.Beyond reaching adult and young adults, the center also works to expand opportunities for children through its Plaza de Ninos preschool, which prepares young Latino children for early school success and helps them with the necessary English language skills, while providing childcare for working parents.The Guadalupe Center's activities and services, which continue to grow in number and impact, serve as an example of the center's vision and dedication for the Latino community.The future of Kansas City and the quality of life for its residents, especially the Latino community, depends on the decisions and the investments made today. The Guadalupe Center had taken the lead in making these strategic investments in Kansas City's urban core. Their efforts have improved the lives of the Latino community's children and families and the effects will be felt for generations to come.I look forward to partnering with the Guadalupe Center in future investments in Kansas City's Latino community. ,2015-03-16 18:18:32.332756,2015-03-16 18:18:32.332756,Senate,GUADALUPE CENTER FOR DEDICATION TO IMPROVING THE LIFE OF LATINO COMMUNITY,2003-04-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-04-28/html/CREC-2003-04-28-pt1-PgS5431-3.htm,61,0,149,S5431,B000611,mr. bond
662,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will transfer the control of the Mingo Job Corps Center to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to be administered by the U.S. Forest Service. Since its inception, the Center has served at-risk youth by providing a facility where students can complete their secondary education and serve the local area through community service projects. The Department of Labor has expressed their plans to contract out operations of the Mingo Center, which is currently administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, an action that would greatly increase the chances for the permanent closure of the facility.The Mingo Job Corps Center has been extremely successful in southern Missouri. For over 40 years, the Center has been a place for students to complete their education, learn a trade, and serve the community. Through the Center, students master trades from auto repair to fire fighting, from carpentry to culinary arts, and from bricklaying to business. The closure of the facility would mean 250 students would not be able to receive their High School Diploma, GED, or learn the skills necessary to earn gainful employment.For over 40 years the Center has made a substantial contribution to the community through service projects. Mingo students have participated in national projects such as the recovery of the space shuttle Columbia and fighting western forest fires. However, the main impact of their activities are felt locally in southern Missouri. Each year the Mingo Job Corps completes over $1 million worth of community and conservation projects. These projects include construction of the Poplar Bluff Forest Service District Office, construction of many Puxico School buildings, and the painting and repair of furniture at various local schools.The Mingo Job Corps Training Center is truly an invaluable asset to the State of Missouri that must be preserved. Last year, with the help of Congresswomen Jo Ann Emerson, I secured a commitment from the USDA to have the Forest Service assume operation of the Mingo Job Corps Center. However, now it has become necessary for this transfer to be handled legislatively. My legislation will ensure that the Center will continue to be a positive force that shapes the lives of our youth. Our economy and the kids who depend upon this facility will remain the real winners here.,2015-03-16 18:18:32.542899,2015-03-16 18:18:32.542899,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2003-11-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-11-03/html/CREC-2003-11-03-pt1-PgS13803-2.htm,157,3,149,S13803-S13804,B000611,mr. bond
663,MO,Jean,Carnahan,D,Madam President, today I am proud to introduce the Uterine Fibroids Research and Education Act 2002. This bipartisan legislation addresses a serious health problem that affects women during their reproductive years. At least twenty to thirty percent of all women aged 35 and older have symptomatic fibroids that require treatment. This number rises to approximately fifty percent for African-American women.I am pleased that two of my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Mikulski, are joining me in sponsoring this legislation. Both are strong advocates for women's health.Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that impact the reproductive health of women, particularly minority women. If they go undetected or untreated, uterine fibroids can lead to childbirth complications or infertility, among other things.For those who do seek treatment, the option prescribed most often is a hysterectomy. Uterine fibroids are the top reason for hysterectomies currently being performed in this country. A hysterectomy is a major operation--the average recovery time is six weeks. This is just the physical impact, the emotional impact lasts much longer.We need to invest additional resources in research, so that there are more treatment options for women, including options less drastic than a hysterectomy. We also need to increase awareness of uterine fibroids, so that more women will recognize the symptoms and seek treatment.To accomplish both of these goals we need a sustained Federal commitment to better understanding uterine fibroids. That is why I am introducing this legislation today.My bill has two components. First, it authorizes $10 million for the National Institutes of Health, (NIH), for each of our years to conduct research on uterine fibroids.Second, the bill supports a public awareness campaign. It calls on the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to carry out a program to provide information and education to the public regarding uterine fibroids. The content of the program shall include information on the incidence and prevalence of uterine fibroids and the elevated risk for minority women. The Secretary shall have the authority to carry out the program either directly or through contract. By Mr. INOUYE:S. 2127.

The team took top honors for their multi-media presentation detailing their year's accomplishments.Drury's SIFE team devoted more than 7,000 hours to 35 educational and community service projects. All of the projects were designed to develop leadership and communication skills through free enterprise education. Besides receiving excellent practical experience in business skills, the students were also investing themselves in their local and national communities.Among their almost three dozen projects this year the team continued to develop and expand the Young Entrepreneurs Association, a web-based organization devoted to free enterprise education for middle school teachers and students. Only three years old, the program now serves 510 middle schools, representing 17 countries and all 50 states.The Team also built on a three year relationship with an ``at-risk'' middle school in Laredo Texas and this year conducted a three day educational program built around the principles of free enterprise, ethical marketing and entrepreneurship. The project culminated with a ``mercado,'' in which 800 customers purchased products designed and produced by the middle school students.Their win qualifies them for the first SIFE World Cup, to be held in London on July 11-13. Teams from 23 nations will compete for the title of SIFE Global Champion.SIFE is a grassroots student movement active on more than 1,000 college and university campuses in 48 states and 20 foreign countries.

He has overseen the growth of the Westmont student body to its present level of 1,200 students, and has put the college on a much firmer financial footing than when he arrived on campus. Prior to coming to Westmont, he serves as Academic Vice President and then Executive Vice President at Whitworth College (WA). He also served on the faculty at Wheaton College (IL) and Calvin College (MI). He received his Ph.D in Anthropology and Sociology from Michigan State University.Among many other accomplishments, Dr. Winter served for nine years with the Western Association of School and Colleges, and in June 2000, he completes a term as Director of the Council of Higher Education Accreditation, based on Washington, D.C. He has been named as one of the most effective college leaders in the United States, and in 1991, he was a recipient of the President Leadership Awards and Grants given nationally by the Knight Foundation. President Winter has also been a leader in the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities, a Washington-based group of over 100 U.S. schools with more than 50 affiliates in 17 countries.He is and I am sure will remain active in many local organizations in Santa Barbara. In 1998, the Santa Barbara News Press honored him with its Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1999, the John Templeton Foundation selected him as one of 50 college presidents who have exercised leadership in character development.But most important of all, David Winter's real impact cannot be measured by awards and titles. His real impact has been on the thousands of students who have attended Westmont in the last twenty-five years. He has spearheaded the effort on the part of the entire Westmont Community to provide a thorough liberal arts education with a Christian foundation.

668,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), for yielding me this time.Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1291, the 21st Century Montgomery GI Bill Enhancement Act. As a co-sponsor of the bill, I urge its passage. This legislation continues our efforts to improve the education program for our men and women in uniform. The bill provides an increase in benefits, including raising the monthly educational stipend to $800 a month for fiscal year 2002, to $1,100 by fiscal year 2004.I remember well the beginnings of what was later known to be the Montgomery GI bill. It was shared between the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the House Committee on Armed Services, and I remember playing a part in making sure that it reached the floor at that time.The gentleman from Mississippi, the Honorable Sonny Montgomery, was the author, is the author; and we should remember his efforts as we improve on that bill today.This legislation is the right step toward enhancing this bill for our veterans. We must continue to take advantage of opportunities to provide our veterans a truly meaningful and substantial educational program.Full funding for tuition and fees and a monthly stipend for living expenses in exchange for a service commitment would dramatically improve the GI program and would bring parity with other scholarship and tuition assistance programs currently available to young Americans. Efforts by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) to build upon improvements under the Montgomery GI bill will greatly improve this education program for our men and women in uniform, and I hope that his efforts on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will continue and that they will be able to pass additional educational benefits, as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) so desires.Now while it is important that the House consider this legislation, the process by which it is brought to the floor concerns me. It is deeply disturbing that no member of the Subcommittee on Benefits or of the full Committee on Veterans' Affairs has been given the opportunity to engage in a full and open debate on this measure or vote on the bill before today.I hope procedural abuses like this do not occur again, because it is not fair, either to the Members of this body or to the veterans for whom it is intended to benefit.,2015-03-16 18:18:33.699723,2015-03-16 18:18:33.699723,House,21ST CENTURY MONTGOMERY GI BILL ENHANCEMENT ACT,2001-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-06-19/html/CREC-2001-06-19-pt1-PgH3212-5.htm,85,9,147,H3212-H3220,S000465,mr. skelton
669,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an institution which for a quarter of a century has served an invaluable role in preserving and remembering our Southwest Missouri history and heritage.Twenty-five years ago The History Museum of Springfield and Greene County was created in honor of the Bicentennial of our great nation. The citizens of Springfield and Greene County established the museum to educate others about the area's culture and open a new window on the history of day-to-day life in the region. A key local education resource was born.Teachers and other educators in Southwest Missouri have been blessed to have such a historical museum readily available. Over the years it has become a favorite field trip destination, permitting thousands of young minds to experience some of the culture that nurtured their parents and grandparents as well as other generations before them. Many educational trips have been hosted by The History Museum for Springfield and Greene County. The Museum, founded and guided in its early years by Springfieldian Kitty Lipscomb, is also a place of remembering and learning for adults too.The museum is a storehouse of knowledge about past experiences which helped shape our families, neighborhoods and communities and are still molding us as a society today. It reveals the common threads that bound neighborhoods and communities together in past generations. Capitalism, Democracy, Liberty and Faith were the core values that stirred our imagination and gave birth to America's work ethic, innovation, and self betterment through a commitment to education, and personal independence. Each of these qualities is on display at the History Museum for Springfield and Greene County in vintage photographs, clothing displays, maps and documents depicting how our communities grew and developed. With its home on the top floor of the Springfield City Hall, the Museum has dedicated itself to the reflection of our past with an eye toward our future.This superb facility gives us the opportunity to memorialize our own stories of accomplishment, development and expansion as well as documenting how we overcame challenges and disagreements. Individuals, neighborhoods, community leaders and institutions joined together to forge a strong, diverse economy and society in the Ozarks.I'm confident that my Colleagues join with me in expressing our thanks to the vision and foresight of community leaders a quarter century ago. Because of their dedicated work, the residents of Southwest Missouri have had a place where they can go to rediscover the roots of our past and benefit from lessons for the future.,2015-03-16 18:18:33.889864,2015-03-16 18:18:33.889864,Extensions,THE HISTORY MUSEUM OF SPRINGFIELD AND GREENE COUNTY,2001-09-10,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-09-10/html/CREC-2001-09-10-pt1-PgE1616-4.htm,116,0,147,E1616-E1617,B000575,mr. blunt
670,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. One of the things that we all worked for and voted for last year right here on the House floor was a resolution that did exactly what you and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra) and others want to do and the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Thune) was mentioning with education. I know the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) was an advocate of this. That was, let us get what money we spend where it does the most good. Let us be focused on education, not focused on bureaucrats. This is the right kind of solution that we need.I think 310 Members of the House, which means that lots of Democrats joined virtually all the Republicans, and we passed a resolution that said that 90 cents out of every dollar in every Federal elementary and secondary program needed to get to the classroom, the Dollars to the Classroom Act. And suddenly we are reducing all that money that is used up by bureaucrats, all that money that is used up by people figuring out new forms to fill out and by people that have to fill out those forms and by people that monitor those forms. We are saying, let us get that money to where it will do some good.Let us be sure that we do not waste $1,800 for every classroom in America every year, like we are doing now when we are getting about 65 cents out of every dollar in the classroom. Let us get 90 cents out of every dollar in the classroom. Let us let parents be involved in that decision. Let us let local building administrators be involved in spending that money. But mostly let us let teachers and kids get together. Let us put that money not in the hands of some bureaucrats in Washington, or even in all of our State capitals, let us put that money in the hands of a teacher who knows every child's name in that class. That can make a difference.,2015-03-16 18:18:34.026983,2015-03-16 18:18:34.026983,House,EXPLAINING THE ATTITUDES, CONCERNS, AND BELIEFS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS,1998-03-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-04/html/CREC-1998-03-04-pt1-PgH841-2.htm,20,18,144,H841-H848,B000575,mr. blunt
671,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to say a few words in tribute to John Ryland Edwards, a superb soldier and educator, who is retiring after 22 years of service to Wentworth Military Academy.Born in Lexington, MO, John Edwards graduated from the University of Missouri with a BS in Education. In 1955, he became a teacher and coach at Henrietta, MO, High School, but joined the United States Army one year later. From 1956 to 1976, Mr. Edwards served his country in the U.S. Army while stationed in Texas, Alaska, Colorado, Indiana, Washington, DC, Vietnam, and Okinawa. During his tenure in the Army, he worked as an Adjutant General Corps Sports Director, an Assistant Army Service Officer, a Special Service Officer, an Administrative Officer, a Recreational Services Officer, an Adjutant General, the Director of Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Office, Army Project Officer for the Presidential Reception honoring Vietnam veterans, Director of U.S. Army Sports Program, Officer in Charge of U.S. Armed Forces basketball team, and the Army Representative to the 1976 Olympics. John Edwards retired from active duty in 1976, with the Legion of Merit award, a Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal (with Oak Leaf Cluster), Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal (with two Oak Leaf Clusters), National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.Following his active duty career, John Edwards moved back to his hometown of Lexington, MO, to serve at Wentworth Military Academy. During his 22-year tenure at Wentworth, John served as Operations Officer, Special Events Coordinator, Project Officer, Athletic Director and basketball coach, Alumni Director, Adult Education Director, and Interim Superintendent. John has provided superior leadership at Wentworth, and has worked with every department on campus. He served as the man behind the scenes who made every event work with precision.In addition to his military career, John Edwards has participated in many community activities. He is a member of the Lexington, MO, Lions Club, Lafayette Regional Health Center Board of Trustees, Lexington Area Chamber of Commerce Board (serving as President for one term), Lafayette County Health Department Board, and Member of Turners. He has received the Melvin Jones Fellow Award and Lion of the Year Award, as well as the Lexington Outstanding Leadership Award.Mr. Speaker, I am certain that my colleagues will join me in paying tribute to John Ryland Edwards, an outstanding Missourian. His career in the United States Army and at Wentworth Military Academy, combined with superb community service, make him a role model for young military and civic leaders.,2015-03-16 18:18:34.151042,2015-03-16 18:18:34.151042,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO JOHN RYLAND EDWARDS,1998-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-30/html/CREC-1998-04-30-pt1-PgE720-2.htm,51,0,144,E720,S000465,mr. skelton
672,MO,William,Clay,D,Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for yielding me this time.Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this voucher bill because it will do absolutely nothing to improve the quality of educational opportunities available in the District of Columbia. What this bill will do, however, is create false hope in the minds of schoolchildren and their parents and allow the Republicans to trumpet a lot of their baseless partisan political themes.Let me say to my Republican colleagues and the District residents that federally funded school vouchers will not be made available here or anywhere else in America during the 105th Congress.Madam Speaker, this is the third time that Republicans have trotted out this misguided D.C. voucher proposal for consideration in the House. Twice before they unsuccessfully attempted to attach it to the D.C. Appropriations bill. Now, the proposal finally stands alone to be judged on its own. It has never gone through the committee process for deliberate consideration. If it had, it would not have seen the light of day.Just, last November, a bipartisan majority of this body soundly rejected legislation to offer federally funded vouchers nationwide. Why? Because Members recognized that vouchers simply channel taxpayer dollars to private and religious schools--something ridiculous to do when budget pressure makes it difficult to properly fund public schools. Members also recognized that the bill would erode protections afforded through our civil rights laws. The voucher proposal before us today suffers from the very same fatal flaws. What's more, the D.C. voucher bill would be vetoed if it were sent to the President.Madam Speaker, we should not undermine the efforts of those local officials who are principally responsible for the education of District students by forcing upon them the failed and unconstitutional voucher experiment. Rather, what we should do is support the Norton substitute to provide the D.C. public schools with $7 million to implement comprehensive reforms and hire additional reading tutors. Both initiatives would target the lowest performing schools. This approach would ensure all D.C. students the promise of a quality education from what would soon become an exemplary public school system.,2015-03-16 18:18:34.291142,2015-03-16 18:18:34.291142,House,DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP ACT OF 1997,1998-04-30,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-30/html/CREC-1998-04-30-pt1-PgH2651.htm,51,5,144,H2651-H2660,C000488,mr. clay
673,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the Republican rule on the National Endowment for the Arts and in support of full funding for the NEA. We must make this commitment not only to fulfill our Nation's cultural life but also to nourish the local economic development efforts which rise from our investments in the arts.I hope that the majority of the House will eventually support funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, but we can only get there by crossing an obstacle course put in place by the Republican leadership. Their Byzantine maneuvering on this rule is a waste of the House's precious time.Support for NEA is more than just about the love of art or high-minded support of cultural endeavors. It is about supporting the efforts of State and local governments to create economic growth. The NEA's funding goes to projects which increase economic opportunity by promoting the cultural and artistic activities of local citizens. The arts enhance a community's quality of life, thereby attracting industry, jobs, and increasing the tax base. Investment in the arts is both economically prudent and wise.Federal funds are leveraged by localities to bring about a bigger bang for the NEA buck. The $98 million invested in the NEA by the Federal Government stimulated State and local governments to provide more than $975 million to the arts. This is big business: The nonprofit arts industry generates $36 billion of business annually and supports 1.3 million full-time jobs.And the NEA benefits rural as well as urban areas. The NEA's partnerships foster rural community revitalization, downtown development, and historic revitalization. The cultural traditions of local communities can serve as a strategy for economic development of economically depressed rural communities.Also, funding for the NEA is about supporting a full and rich education for our children. In 1997, 10 percent of its annual grant dollars were spent in support of pre-K through 12 arts education programs. NEA grants are used to provide educational opportunities for millions of children to learn and be enriched by the arts, opportunities that would not exist without the NEA.So we need to fund the NEA to make sure that we nurture the artistic capabilities of all Americans. Funding for the NEA is a small investment in the spiritual and intellectual health of our country. It has and will continue to pay great dividends for our Nation, far beyond its modest cost.I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and support full funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.,2015-03-16 18:18:34.424243,2015-03-16 18:18:34.424243,House,PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4193, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999,1998-07-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-07-21/html/CREC-1998-07-21-pt1-PgH5972.htm,98,14,144,H5972-H5980,G000132,mr. gephardt
674,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise to express good luck to our colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Fawell, who is retiring from the House at the end of this Congress. It has been my privilege to serve with Mr. Fawell on the Committee on Education and the Workforce throughout Mr. Fawell's congressional career. During that time we have more often taken opposing points of view regarding legislation, particularly legislation affecting the labor laws. However, our differences have been political, never personal. Further, though our views may have differed on most issues, those differences have not prevented us from working together when we have been able to find common ground. When we have found common ground, we have successfully enacted good legislation.In the last Congress, I joined with Mr. Fawell in support of legislation to provide an exemption for police and fire departments from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In this Congress, I supported the efforts of Mr. Fawell, and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Payne, to enact the Saver Act. I also participated in the national summit on retirement savings that the Saver Act created. I believe both the first summit and the subsequent summits that will occur as a result of enactment of the Saver Act will serve to better educate workers regarding the importance of retirement savings. As a result, more workers will have financially secure retirements.I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Fawell for his work on the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act. Recently enacted as part of the Higher Education Act, this law permits certain voluntary retirement incentive plans for college faculty. I was not initially a supporter of this legislation. However, Mr. Fawell worked diligently to address concerns raised by myself and others and the final product is one in which we all, and especially Mr. Fawell, may be proud.Mr. Fawell first came to Congress in 1985, following the retirement of John Erlenborn. Mr. Erlenborn had a substantial reputation in this body as both a leader for conservative positions on labor issues and for his role in the enactment and subsequent development of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Many thought Mr. Erlenborn's shoes would be difficult to fill. But let me say for the record that, from my perspective, Harris, you fully filled the shoes of your distinguished predecessor. I wish the best for you and your family in the years ahead.,2015-03-16 18:18:34.569346,2015-03-16 18:18:34.569346,House,TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN HARRIS FAWELL,1998-10-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-06/html/CREC-1998-10-06-pt1-PgH9654.htm,138,21,144,H9654-H9659,C000488,mr. clay
675,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.Mr. Chairman, I, too, am a grandfather. I have three grandchildren in public schools, and I am concerned about them as well as any other grandparent.But I was lost by the logic or illogic of the last statement made about compassion for a seventh grader who is in an unsafe environment and that parent being able to take that child out of that unsafe environment and put that child in a safe environment.I would think that to take one child out of an unsafe environment and leave the rest of the children in that unsafe environment does not make much sense. I would think one would take the disruptive children, the ones who are causing the unsafe environment, out of that situation and leave all of the children in a safe environment.I, too, am a grandparent. I have many reasons why I oppose this amendment. The Committee on Education and the Workforce deliberated at length on the issue of private school vouchers. Then we voted overwhelmingly in committee to reject that concept.Second, if this amendment were adopted, it would destroy the bipartisanship we developed on this bill during the last 12 or 14 months. It would also jeopardize all the progress that we are making in improving Title I.Beyond that, Mr. Chairman, this is a reckless amendment that would divert funds from poor public schools to parochial schools. It provides no oversight of the quality of education provided with Federal funds, which is the opposite of what we are doing in the rest of this bill.Also, Federal funding of private school vouchers raises serious constitutional issues that could jeopardize the independence of religious schools and disrupt the administration of Title I programs.Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill would have a very discriminatory effect. Those students who get private school vouchers can receive up to $3,500 in vouchers, which is substantially more than per pupil allocation for current Title I students who are in the public schools.So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.,2015-03-16 18:18:34.702434,2015-03-16 18:18:34.702434,House,STUDENT RESULTS ACT OF 1999,1999-10-21,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-21/html/CREC-1999-10-21-pt1-PgH10621-3.htm,144,6,145,H10621-H10656,C000488,mr. clay
676,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dr. C. Pat Taylor, who has served as president of Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, for the last 15 years, making him the longest serving president in the 133-year history of the school. Dr. Taylor already had an impressive record in higher education before coming to SBU in 1996. In the last 15 years he has added to that record of accomplishment and earned respect for his leadership and dedication to the students and community at Southwest Baptist University.Southwest Baptist University is a very special place to me. I earned my undergraduate degree there and 20 years later served 4 years as its President. Dr. Taylor is my successor, and I have enjoyed watching the university grow and get even better under his leadership.During his remarkable tenure at SBU:Dr. Taylor has presented a record 11,881 degrees since 1996.SBU has Missouri's third largest nursing degree program on its Springfield campus.The number of student missionaries sent out in North American has doubled to more than 400 in the last decade, and Dr. Taylor hopes to see that continue to increase. Student enrollment peaked at more than 3700 in the fall of 2009 and remains at 3,576 this semester.The Partner in Excellence campaign between 1999 and 2005 raised a record $62 million to fund 13 major building projects for the arts, instructional technology and extended learning, sports and athletics, religious education, and campus parking.The SBU endowment more than doubled during the last decade to over $19 million.The school's first doctoral program was launched, and the number of physical therapy applications has grown each year.``It's all God's blessing,'' Dr. Taylor has explained. ``We've worked hard, but God has blessed it. It's not what we've done, but it's what God has done through us. When I really look at our success, it's because God has ordained that we will be successful.''I could not agree with Dr. Taylor more. I would add that Dr. Taylor is a blessing to Southwest Baptist University and the community. It is my hope that Southwest Baptist University continues to meet its mission as a ``Christ-centered, caring academic community preparing students to be servant leaders in a global society.'' It is a bold calling, and I am certain SBU has the leadership and dedication in Dr. Taylor to see it fulfilled. ,2015-03-16 18:18:34.827523,2015-03-16 18:18:34.827523,Senate,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2011-09-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-09-26/html/CREC-2011-09-26-pt1-PgS5991-3.htm,144,0,157,S5991-S5992,B000575,mr. blunt

The Outstanding Public Service Award is the second highest honor given by the Chairman to a public servant who ``has rendered service or assistance to considerable personal sacrifice, motivated by patriotism, good citizenship and a sense of public responsibility.''Sgt. Sewell enlisted in the United States Air Force on January 23, 2003, and was assigned to Spangdahlem Airbase, Germany, as a Munitions Systems Inspector. During his service, he was deployed to Afghanistan with the 52nd Fighter Wing in support of the unit's A-10, which assisted in the first elections held in Afghanistan. He completed his military service in August of 2007 with the 509th Bomb Wing at Whitman Air Force Base, Missouri. Currently, Mr. Sewell is a Staff Sergeant with the Missouri Air National Guard with the 131st Bomb Wing in Whiteman Air Force Base.Sgt. Sewell received a bachelor's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Missouri. He's currently working toward the completion of his master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Missouri. Mr. Sewell was the president of the student veteran's group at the University of Missouri, and he led the organization in efforts to establish the first on-campus Veteran's Center in the country. The Veteran's Center provides a ``one-stop'' resource center for our veterans on campus, which assists the veteran with all student veteran needs. He continues to find ways to assist veterans by teaching a class called ``Learning and Transition Strategies for Veterans.'' The goal is for veterans to have a successful transition from military life back to academic life.Sgt. Sewell continues to find ways to help veterans by being an advocate. He was the advocate for the review of military transfer credits. This led to hundreds of veterans receiving academic credit for their applicable military education and training. He manages and coordinates with the Student Veteran Volunteer network, which helps veterans working toward their higher education on a national level.In closing, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Sgt.

Lieutenant General Arter exemplifies the attributes of General Alexander W. Doniphan, and has carried on Doniphan's legacy through a lifetime of service.Lieutenant General Arter has distinguished himself as a military leader since he first received his commission in 1950. He has held numerous command and staff positions including command of the 1st Battalion, 506th Airborne Infantry, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) and command of the First Brigade, 101st. His commitment to excellence in leadership and command has led to great recognition, including being named the Commanding General of the United States Army Military District of Washington and Commanding General of the Sixth United States Army. Even after his retirement, he continues to address the needs of both civilians and military as a member of the Governor's Military Affairs Coordinating Council.Lieutenant General Arter has also been instrumental in the training and education of servicemembers. He has served as the Commanding General of the Third ROTC Region, Deputy Commanding General for the U.S. Training Center in Fort Ord, and as Deputy Commandant, for the U.S. Command and General Staff College. He went on to hold a position as the Superintendent of Wentworth Military Academy, and he maintains an active and vital role in the education of future leaders as Chairman of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Foundation.Lieutenant General Arter has also been committed to furthering business and economic development in his community. He has served as President and CEO of the Armed Forces Bank in Leavenworth, Kansas and remains a member of their board.

686,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, 8 years of failed economic policies under the Bush administration left a deep economic hole for the new Obama administration, but three things are clear: It will take some time to dig out; we have made steady progress; and there is much more to do.But yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released its report showing progress with new jobs created and decreasing unemployment in my home State of Missouri. Now is not the time to reverse direction. We must remain focused on the real measure of recovery, and that's jobs. We need to move beyond bickering to real solutions that will put real people back to work.I urge my colleagues to once again take up the job-creating America COMPETES bill that would strengthen U.S. scientific and economic leadership, support employers, and create jobs through investments in science, innovation, and education.We can't let partisan gridlock hold us back while countries pass us by to invent, build, and sell us the technology that will power the next century.

Each devoted over four hundred hours of voluntary public service to St. Louis Irish Arts, where they taught and performed traditional Irish dance for the benefit of people of all ages.As is required for the Congressional Award, each of these young women also completed an expedition of personal discovery, traveling to Ireland to become immersed in a different culture and study Irish music.Natasha and Abigail have both demonstrated a passion for self-discovery through the examination of traditional Irish culture, and extended that passion to the education and betterment of others within their community.Young people such as these show a promising future for the United States, and I am proud and honored to have such individuals in the Third Congressional District of the great state of Missouri. I find it fitting that we should recognize their achievements here today, and I look forward to how they will continue to apply themselves in the future.,2015-03-16 18:18:36.617796,2015-03-16 18:18:36.617796,Extensions,HONORING ABIGAIL FRONICK AND NATASHA SANFORD,2010-06-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-06-23/html/CREC-2010-06-23-pt1-PgE1174-3.htm,95,0,156,E1174,C001060,mr. carnahan
688,MO,Emanuel,Cleaver,D,Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of Rev. Doctor Samuel E. Mann, an individual who has dedicated his life to helping the underserved in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, the District that I am honored to represent. This weekend, Reverend Mann is retiring, after 40 years as Pastor Administrator of St. Mark Union Church and executive director of United Inner City Services. In that capacity, he oversaw a budget of $1.5 million annually, a sixty-two member staff and programs that included: child and family development, social services, and community development and street organizations and violence prevention.He is a native of Eufaula, Alabama and a graduate of Birmingham Southern College, BA; Duke Divinity School, M. Div., and St. Paul School of Theology, D. Min. He is married to Dr. Beverlye J. Brown, and is the father of three children and grandfather of seven.Remarkably, Rev. Mann was a local preacher at the age of 15 years old at the First Methodist Church of Eufaula, Alabama; he was later the Associate Pastor of St. John United Methodist Church of Kansas City, Missouri, and sometime later, the Pastor of the First Methodist Church of Peculiar, MO, and Director of the Young Adult Projects, Inc. Rev. Mann was dismissed from both churches because of his views on race and peace.As a long-time civil rights activist, Rev. Mann marched in numerous demonstrations, including the march for the garbage workers in Memphis, Tennessee, the march against the war in Vietnam, led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and was part of the U.S. delegation that visited with South Africa ANC leader Dr. Nelson Mandela shortly after his release from prison. Dr. Mann has also been jailed on several occasions for his participation in these activities. He served as a key participant in the national effort to respond to the burning of black churches in America. He has traveled to Nicaragua and China for various humanitarian efforts.Rev. Mann was instrumental in the formation of Operation Break and Build, a street outreach organization that evolved out of the Urban Peace and Justice Summit in 1994. Its purpose was to assist street organizations, gangs, with transforming their lives via crisis intervention, education, economic development, addressing women's issues, and criminal justice.He has been the recipient of many awards, including the NAACP Harold Holiday Award; the John M. Swomley Human Rights Award, the Elder Statesmen of Kansas City award, the MO Jazz award, the Sam Eason Award presented by Niles Home; the Black Archives of Mid-America award; the Beta Omega PSI PHI Fraternity Inc.'s Citizen of the Year Award; and many, many more. He is co-founder of the project ``Reframing the Dialogue on Race in America.'' Through this national project, he attempts to address the problem of race by focusing on the issues of white supremacy and white privilege. Through training, he seeks to inspire ministries to address racism in their congregations.His most recent project was the building of the $4 million child care center, the St. Mark Child & Family Development Center, located at 2008 E. 12th Street in Kansas City, Missouri. St. Mark's is a state of the art child care facility that annually serves approximately 225 low-income families through its early childhood education program, before- and after-school program, and summer camp. Nearly 100 percent of the children are African American, with many living in single parent households in one of Kansas City, Missouri's poorest neighborhoods.Rev. Mann is presently a leader working in concert with other agencies in making Kansas City a Zone Seven site to provide additional services in the urban core for the education of children. I am proud of the federal funding I helped secure for St. Mark.Madam Speaker, it is an honor and privilege for me to recognize my friend, and colleague, the Reverend Doctor Sam Mann for his efforts to improve the education and quality of life in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. It is with great pride that we honor Reverend Doctor Mann today for his commitment to the residents of Missouri. On behalf of the people of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, I wish this thunderous preacher and fearless prophet a well-deserved retirement.,2015-03-16 18:18:36.756895,2015-03-16 18:18:36.756895,Extensions,RECOGNIZING REVEREND DOCTOR SAM E.

692,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,I rise today and join the Epilepsy Foundation in calling for Americans to Get Seizure Smart! Epilepsy awareness is critically important because Americans need a better understanding about the basics of the condition. For instance, people often characterize seizures as jerking and shaking uncontrollably. However, not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many different symptoms of seizures, which can include eye fluttering, staring and laughing. Recurring seizures can be a sign of epilepsy.Epilepsy awareness is critically important for public servants too. Because first responders are often called when someone is having a seizure, it's critical they have good information on which to act. And because epilepsy is common in children, educators, administrators and parents need to know how to respond in an emergency.For 40 years, the Epilepsy Foundation has been raising awareness and reducing the stigma associating with this condition. Specifically, I commend the Epilepsy Foundation of Missouri and Kansas in their efforts to ensure that people living with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences. They are working to prevent, control, and cure epilepsy through research, education, advocacy, and services.I urge my colleagues to Get Seizure Smart! to help dispel the myths associated with epilepsy and empower those millions of Americans affected by this condition. We must work together to learn more about epilepsy and connect with our local Epilepsy Foundation to raise awareness in our communities.,2015-03-16 18:18:37.465404,2015-03-16 18:18:37.465404,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL EPILEPSY MONTH,2010-12-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2010-12-02/html/CREC-2010-12-02-pt1-PgE2035-2.htm,156,0,156,E2035,C001060,mr. carnahan
693,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Madam Speaker, there is a condition in this country that affects more than 3 million people and sees 200,000 new cases every year; 25 percent are children. It's epilepsy. It's the third most common neurological disorder after Alzheimer's and stroke. The cause is unknown in two-thirds of epilepsy cases. It can develop at any age. It can be a result of genetics, stroke, head injury, and other factors.Earlier this year, I met a spirited 9-year-old from my district. Since the age of 7, Chad has been living with epilepsy and faces daunting challenges in school because of various misconceptions. Despite major progress in diagnosis and treatment, epilepsy is often misunderstood and overlooked. Contrary to belief, it is not contagious. Some believe epilepsy is curable with medication or treatment when, in fact, over 30 percent of patients suffer uncontrollable seizures despite treatment.This is why raising awareness is so important. It will dispel myths and empower millions affected by this condition. I urge my colleagues to support further research, awareness, and education as we work together to find a cure for epilepsy.,2015-03-16 18:18:37.609506,2015-03-16 18:18:37.609506,House,NATIONAL EPILEPSY AWARENESS,2009-12-02,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-12-02/html/CREC-2009-12-02-pt1-PgH13391-5.htm,177,1,155,H13391,C001060,mr. carnahan

This is not an ongoing effort in every single country, whether Colombia might have graduated, Nicaragua, and other countries.But, you know, with so many threats against our Nation, I just think it's important to share America's bounty with hungry children in other places and in critical places around the world so that we can help America feed their hungry bodies out of goodness.And it really is something that the entire Defense Department--you ask any Army officer or any member of the armed services, when they are in areas where these children's lives are being changed by a bowl of mush, as Mr. McGovern said, it makes a huge difference. It makes them able to go to school.

Anthony this week. She and I learned together about the right to vote and equal access to education for women that she fought for so valiantly but never lived to see.

His work to improve business, safety, and historic preservation in his community and State does not go unnoticed.He's a devoted father and husband. He's been married to his best friend, Kathy, for 46 years and has one son, Brian, a local businessman. A veteran of the United States Army, a graduate of Ozark Christian College in Joplin, Reverend Shaw has also been a witness for his faith in over 30 countries.It's truly my honor to welcome Reverend Shaw to the House today and thank him for his service to Missouri and many years of dedicated service to the city of Joplin.,2015-03-16 18:21:21.320876,2015-03-16 18:21:21.320876,House,WELCOMING REVEREND GARY SHAW,2009-03-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-26/html/CREC-2009-03-26-pt1-PgH4029-4.htm,52,2,155,H4029,B000575,mr. blunt
703,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, the fallout from the failed policies of the last 8 years will take time to turn around.The Bush administration inherited a record surplus of $5.6 trillion, and turned it into a record deficit of $5.8 trillion. President Obama's budget is a long-term plan to turn the economy around and transform it for future prosperity, with targeted investments in health care, energy, and education. The plan takes steps to reduce health care costs, one of the largest contributors to the deficit and a growing burden on American businesses like the auto industry. The budget includes $2 trillion worth of savings, ending the war in Iraq, cutting programs that are not effective, and ending tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas.My constituents who are struggling to make ends meet continue to urge me to support this budget. The American people understand this commonsense blueprint for change is exactly what we need for these challenging times. They understand it cuts taxes for 95 percent of Americans, cuts wasteful spending, cuts the deficit in half over 4 years. What this budget grows is jobs. We can't afford to wait.,2015-03-16 18:21:21.549037,2015-03-16 18:21:21.549037,House,LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLAN BEGINS GROWING JOBS,2009-03-31,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-03-31/html/CREC-2009-03-31-pt1-PgH4137-7.htm,54,1,155,H4137-H4138,C001060,mr. carnahan

705,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, last week, the House passed House Resolution 492, recognizing this week as High-Performance Building Week. The resolution aims to provide greater public awareness about the benefits of high-performance buildings, and it works to increase education about the impact buildings have on our environment.Each year, our homes, offices, schools, and other buildings consume 70 percent of our electricity, 60 percent of all raw materials, and they emit 40 percent of all CO emissions in the U.S. By designing and building high-performance buildings, we reduce energy consumption and our carbon footprint. We save both water and raw materials. We save demolition and construction debris from going into landfills. Most importantly, high-performance building construction creates good-paying jobs that give workers the valuable skills they need to excel in a clean energy economy.2It is my hope that Members will use this week to highlight the importance that buildings have on our environment and for Congress to continue to support future research, development and the deployment of high-performance building technologies.,2015-03-16 18:21:21.996350,2015-03-16 18:21:21.996350,House,RECOGNIZING THIS WEEK AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE BUILDING WEEK,2009-06-15,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-06-15/html/CREC-2009-06-15-pt1-PgH6748-7.htm,89,1,155,H6748,C001060,mr. carnahan

Ryan had had a seizure. Ryan went on to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, where he majored in political science. At Westminster, Ryan remained politically active, became vice president of the Student Government Association, and was elected Homecoming King during the fall of his senior year. All the while, he hid his epilepsy from his peers.Epilepsy is one of the most common disorders of the nervous system. It affects people of all ages, races, and ethnic backgrounds. More than 3 million Americans of all ages are living with epilepsy, and every year, 200,000 Americans will develop seizures and epilepsy for the first time. Epilepsy can develop at any time of life, especially in early childhood and old age. It's a neurological condition that makes people susceptible to seizures.Ryan is now 25 and serves as a congressional aide. He hopes to use his experiences and influence to raise awareness. As November is designated National Epilepsy Awareness Month, I am honored to help Ryan promote his message for increased research, awareness, and education to openly work toward a cure.,2015-03-16 18:21:23.000064,2015-03-16 18:21:23.000064,House,HONORING RYAN DILLON DURING NATIONAL EPILEPSY AWARENESS MONTH,2009-11-18,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2009-11-18/html/CREC-2009-11-18-pt1-PgH13115-4.htm,171,1,155,H13115,E000172,mrs. emerson

720,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Madam President, we have successfully added this amendment to all appropriations bills to date. It is a very simple amendment. It requires the Departments under this bill to maintain a direct link to the agency's inspector general Web site, on the home page of his or her department's Web site. It requires this direct link because the information the inspector general provides to the public needs to be easily available. They are the eyes and ears of the taxpayers in many ways. They are on the front lines in terms of waste, fraud, and abuse. They provide a valuable service. In many departments, one can't find the information. This amendment will require that on the home page of the Web sites of the Departments of Education, Labor Health and Human Services, there be a direct link to the inspector general of that Department's Web site so taxpayers, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch can easily find the important information that is provided by the inspector general's office.I urge passage of the amendment.,2015-03-16 18:21:25.949164,2015-03-16 18:21:25.949164,Senate,DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008, Continued,2007-10-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-10-17/html/CREC-2007-10-17-pt1-PgS12962-2.htm,157,133,153,S12962-S12980,M001170,mrs. mccaskill

I always take pleasure in giving reasons for why I am a member of the Democratic Party.Since taking control of Congress, Democrats have worked to pass legislation that will help families once again live the American Dream. Over the last 6 years, college costs have shot up 40 percent, putting higher education out of reach for most Americans. I have one son in college today, and I can tell you I am excited over the fact that we passed, and the President did, in fact, sign the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This law is the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill. It strengthens the middle class by cutting interest rates in half and subsidizes student loans over the next 5 years. We are also able, in this bill, to increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarships by $500.Madam Speaker, I am pleased and I am excited to be a Democrat.,2015-03-16 18:21:26.225357,2015-03-16 18:21:26.225357,House,DEMOCRATS TRYING TO EASE THE PAIN OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BY MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE,2007-10-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-10-23/html/CREC-2007-10-23-pt1-PgH11850-9.htm,161,1,153,H11850,C001061,mr. cleaver

736,MO,Russ,Carnahan,D,Mr. Speaker, parents and students should take note: College may soon get a lot more expensive if House Republicans get their way.This week, they plan to bring a budget reconciliation bill to the floor that cuts $14 billion in Federal student aid, the largest cuts in the program's history. Included are nearly $8 billion in new charges that will raise the cost of college loans through new fees and higher interest for millions of American students and families.For the typical student borrower already saddled with over $17,000 in debt, these new fees and higher interest charges will cost up to $5,800 more.Financial barriers should never prevent a qualified student from going to college, and that is why America has long since made the commitment to help all Americans afford a higher education. Studies show that financial barriers alone will prevent over 4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public university over the next decade and prevent another 2 million from attending college at all.Mr. Speaker, the wrong priorities in this Republican budget reconciliation will put college out of reach for millions of American students.

But I would not put that on the list of things that we are almost certain to do, but certainly it is on the list of things we are looking at to see if there is a way we can go ahead and advance a House position so that our friends on the other side of the Capitol can move on this issue as well, and early next year, we could come to conclusion on an issue that is so critically important to so many Americans and their families.,2015-03-16 18:21:29.750862,2015-03-16 18:21:29.750862,House,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2005-12-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2005-12-08/html/CREC-2005-12-08-pt1-PgH11266-5.htm,157,18,151,H11266-H11268,B000575,mr. blunt
738,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Honorable Bishop Vinton Randolph Anderson. Bishop Anderson's devotion to the ministry is exhibited by his history of preaching and lecturing internationally, including the Caribbean, Canada, Taiwan, India and Australia. In addition to his commitment to ministering, Bishop Anderson has been an effective and vocal advocate of civil rights and ecumenical issues.Bishop Anderson was born in 1947 in Somerset, Bermuda. He graduated with honors from Wilberforce University and earned his Master of Divinity Degree from Payne Theological Seminary. Later he earned his Master of Arts Degree in philosophy from Kansas University. Bishop Anderson has also received honorary doctorate degrees from Paul Quinn College, Wilberforce University, Payne Theological Seminary, Temple Bible College, Morris Brown College, Interdenominational Theological Center and Eden Theological Seminary. Bishop Anderson's pastoral experience encompasses Kansas and Missouri.Bishop Anderson has demonstrated his unwavering dedication to community development by creating adult education programs, summer youth programs, promoting the first black owned supermarket in St. Louis, and developing 162 units of low income housing in St. Louis County. Bishop Anderson's extraordinary leadership is exemplified through his participation as chairman of several boards of directors, membership with many committees and by the numerous honors that have been bestowed upon him.Mr. Speaker, it is with great privilege that I recognize Bishop Anderson today before Congress. He is well-deserved of our respect, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Bishop Vinton Randolph Anderson.,2015-03-16 18:21:30.018053,2015-03-16 18:21:30.018053,Extensions,A TRIBUTE TO BISHOP VINTON RANDOLPH ANDERSON,2004-03-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-03/html/CREC-2004-03-03-pt1-PgE285-3.htm,26,0,150,E285-E286,C001049,mr. clay

742,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, let me take this means to recognize Lincoln University in Jefferson City, MO, on 137 years of service to the State of Missouri. On January 30, the annual Founders' Day Celebration was held at Richardson Auditorium at the university.Lincoln University was founded on January 14, 1866, by soldiers and officers of the 62nd and the 65th Missouri Colored Infantry units. They gave a combined $6,400 to establish the educational institution they named Lincoln Institute. The institute was founded with three stipulations: The institution shall be designed for the special benefit of the freed African Americans; it shall be located in the State of Missouri; and its fundamental idea shall be to combine study and labor.In 1921, the Missouri Legislature passed a bill introduced by Walthall M. Moore, the first Black American to serve in that body, which changed the name from Lincoln Institute to Lincoln University and created a board of curators to govern the University.Mr. Speaker, Lincoln University's annual Founders' Day Celebration is not only a celebration of another passing year's educational service but a chance once a year to remember the history of this great university. I applaud Lincoln University for its willingness to not forget the past and make sure its students know exactly how their university came to be. I know the Members of the House will join me in congratulating Lincoln University on 137 years of education excellence.,2015-03-16 18:21:31.093817,2015-03-16 18:21:31.093817,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN UNIVERSITY,2003-03-03,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-03-03/html/CREC-2003-03-03-pt1-PgE343-2.htm,33,0,149,E343,S000465,mr. skelton

It is the right thing to do. I appreciate the work of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hostettler) and the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) on this issue.There was a phrase that the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hostettler) used that is part of our Constitution. Mr. Speaker, the United States Constitution requires the Congress to raise and maintain the military and also to establish the rules and regulations thereof. Through my years in Congress, I have had the opportunity to do both and particularly, in writing rules and regulations insofar as military education is concerned and insofar as the structure of the military is concerned, which resulted in what we now call Goldwater-Nickles.Mr. Speaker, this is the right thing to do. The Americans are in Saudi Arabia, have been in Saudi Arabia, were there to make sure that Saddam Hussein's troops did not come down south and into that country.

746,MO,Karen,McCarthy,D,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gracious gentlewoman from Hawaii for this opportunity to join with her today as we are commemorating the 30th anniversary of the passage of title IX of the education amendments of 1972.This title has been instrumental in prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs and sports activities that receive Federal funding. This law applies to admissions, recruitment, financial aid, academic programs, grading, vocational education, recreation, physical education, employment, athletics, and much more. This title continues to present many opportunities for girls to acquire new skills, friendships and make their dreams a reality.Before title IX, many schools saw no problem in maintaining strict limits on the admission of women or simply refusing to admit them at all. Since the passage of title IX, this has changed dramatically. In 1994, women received 38 percent of medical degrees, 43 percent of law degrees, and 44 percent of all doctoral degrees. In 1972, women received only 9 percent of medical degrees, only 7 percent of law degrees, and a mere 25 percent of doctoral degrees.Title IX has provided unprecedented opportunities for young women interested in pursuing a competitive athletic career. The U.S. Women's Soccer team won the World Cup victory in 1991 against Norway and again in 1999 against China, and this was possible because title IX funds were available to the young women earlier in their lives.I had the opportunity to share a remarkable experience with the team. I was able to attend Eileen Collins' launch of a NASA space shuttle with the soccer team, then First Lady Hillary Clinton, and many other supporters of title IX. This was the first time a woman commanded a NASA shuttle. It was a spectacular event that symbolized the accomplishments of the act. Commander Collins and members of the soccer team continue to inspire younger women to follow their own dreams.Younger women are now aggressively entering many fields with more confidence and assurance because of the positive impact of models such as these and the availability of title IX funds. In my district, title IX has allowed many young women to enter and excel in sports. Independence's Fort Osage High School's Dana Rohr was awarded a $2,000 scholarship for her academic work and participation in sports. Angela Goodson of Blue Springs South High School won the Missouri State Girls title in swimming. Liz Pierson of Lee's Summit North won six goals and three assists for her soccer team, which finished second in Missouri. Janiece Gatson, a junior in Grandview, won fifth place at the Missouri 4A State meet for running 400 meters in 57.3 seconds. Saint Theresa's, an all girls' school in my district, became the first non-St. Louis team to win a Missouri 1A-3A soccer girls title with a 6-2 victory this past Saturday.Thanks to title IX, more and more young women are being recognized and encouraged for their scholarly and athletic work. Since 1971, women's participation in sports has markedly increased, with more than 135,000 women presently competing in intercollegiate sports. Women currently constitute nearly 40 percent of all college athletes, compared with only 15 percent in 1972.Recent data show that approximately 2.6 million high school girls participate in a wide selection of high school sports, representing nearly 40 percent of all high school athletes. In 1971, only 7.5 percent of high school athletes were female.Female participation in sports, like receiving a college education, has had an unexpected benefit for women. Studies have shown that values learned from sports participation, such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, and pride in accomplishment, are important attributes as women increase their participation in this workforce as well as their entry into business management and ownership positions.My love of sports throughout my schooling gave me confidence and a sense of accomplishment. The friendships I made with teammates and the memories we share keep us in contact in our adult lives. My experience in sports enabled me to attain leadership and professional skills and gave me the confidence that helped shape my career.Thirty years after the passage of title IX, we recognize and celebrate the profound changes this legislation has helped to bring about in America and the resulting improvements in educational and related job opportunities for millions of Americans. More and more women are entering and graduating from college and graduate school, more women are entering and excelling in sports activities, and more women are entering the corporate world and holding management positions.I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Mrs. Mink) for her leadership in enacting title IX. Thanks to her courage and her persistence, the country is better because more women are able to achieve their full potential. I am pleased to join with her and my colleagues today in celebrating the 30th anniversary of title IX and promise to work with them to uphold and enforce this legislation in order to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans.,2015-03-16 18:21:32.096534,2015-03-16 18:21:32.096534,House,CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX,2002-06-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-06-19/html/CREC-2002-06-19-pt1-PgH3703-6.htm,82,13,148,H3703-H3709,M000316,ms. mccarthy of missouri

752,MO,Jo Ann,Emerson,R,Mr. Speaker, Susan B. Anthony is remembered for her pioneering work to establish equal rights for women. As she fought to widen society's guarantee of equal rights to include women, she also sought to widen this guarantee for others as well. For Susan B. Anthony, this meant opposing slavery. And it also meant rejecting abortion, which she considered nothing less than ``child murder.'' Today, 180 years after Susan B. Anthony's birth which we commemorate today, we continue her legacy in promoting equality under the law for all, including the unborn.Susan B. Anthony rejected abortion because she championed equal rights for all. In Anthony's view, abortion violated the rights of both women and children for it deprived the unborn of their right to life, and exploited women. As Susan B. Anthony said: ``When a woman destroys the life of her unborn child, it is a sign that, by education or circumstance, she has been greatly wronged.''On this the 180th anniversary of her birthday, let us recommit ourselves to fulfilling the pro-life and pro-women vision of Susan B. Anthony, moving toward that day when neither women nor children shall ever again be greatly wronged by abortion.,2015-03-16 18:23:24.463400,2015-03-16 18:23:24.463400,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO SUSAN B.

This week, May 14-20, is National Police Week, set aside to honor the men and women behind the badge. In 1962, Congress passed and President Kennedy signed a joint resolution proclaiming May 15 of each year as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week of each year during which such May 15 occurs as Police Week, ``in recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our laws,'' from Public Law 87-726.Sadly, between 140 and 160 law enforcement officers die in the line of duty each year. On average, 21,433 officers are injured in the line of duty each year.In honor of the thousands of officers who have given their lives to protect the people of this Nation, I am pleased to announce an important step that the Senate took yesterday in furtherance of a much needed change in the current federal law. Last September I introduced S. 1638, a bill to expand the educational opportunities under the Deegan program, named after slain Federal officer Bill Deegan, for the families of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. This bill honors those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending our communities by making available Federal funds to those officers' spouses and dependent children in order to pursue secondary education.Yesterday, on National Peace Officers Memorial Day, the Senate unanimously passed S. 1638. I want to thank the Senate for taking this action, and urge the House to do the same.I want to thank the co-sponsors of this bill--Senators Collins, Grams, Robb, Tim Hutchinson, Dodd, Abraham, Specter, Bryan, Gregg, Helms, and Biden. I am very pleased by the bipartisan support for the bill, and for the endorsements of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and other law enforcement organizations.This bill extends retroactively the benefits created under the 1992 law to the surviving spouses and dependent children of law enforcement officials who were killed between 1978 and the current start dates of the program.It is important to extend these benefits back to the year 1978 because under the existing program, a large number of dependent children currently between the ages 8 and 21, those born between 1978 and 1992, are excluded from participating in the program merely because their parent was killed before 1992. Pushing back the date allows these dependent children, currently facing the prospect of paying for secondary education in the often financially strained environment of a single-parent family, also to benefit from this program.This goal is consistent with the intent of the original law: an effort to show our gratitude to the maximum number of dependent children of slain law enforcement officers.This provision affects the families of an estimated 4,100 officers, including more than 60 in Missouri. The bill makes these spouses and dependent children eligible for up to $5820 a year for 4 years if they enroll in full-time study at an approved secondary school. In short, it helps the loved ones of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defending the rest of us by allowing them to pursue their dreams to move forward with their lives and continue their education.On this occasion, I also want to thank a very important organization headquartered in Camdenton, MO--the Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. [COPS]. COPS was organized in 1984 with 110 members. Today COPS' membership is over 10,000 families. Concerns of Police Survivors, provides resources to assist in the rebuilding of the lives of surviving families of slain law enforcement officers.Furthermore, COPS provides training to law enforcement agencies on survivor victimization issues and educates the public of the need to support the law enforcement profession and its survivors.To help those families begin rebuilding their shattered lives, COPS is again hosting the National Police Survivors' Seminars as part of National Police Week--the second day of this seminar is occurring today in Alexandria, VA. For 15 years, COPS' National Police Survivors' Seminars have provided survivors of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty the opportunity to interact with other survivors and have access to some of the best mental health professionals available. I wish to thank COPS for the many programs that they operate in addition to the Police Survivors' Seminars, including scholarships, peer-support at the national, State, and local levels, ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' counseling programs, the ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' Summer Camp, Parents' Retreats, trial and parole support, and other assistance programs.We owe a debt of gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of police officers who protect the lives and property of their fellow Americans. By the enforcement of our laws, these same officers have given our country internal freedom from fear and are responsible for helping our nation lower its crime rates again this year. These men and women, by their patriotic service and their dedicated efforts, have earned the gratitude of us all.Officers who give their lives to protect our freedom leave behind families that must cope with the terrible loss. When this tragedy occurs, we have an obligation to help the spouses and children of fallen heroes. One way to help is to offer the opportunity to pursue their education. I thank the Senate for supporting this bill, and urge the House of Representatives to pass this legislation quickly.,2015-03-16 18:23:24.602504,2015-03-16 18:23:24.602504,Senate,LAW ENFORCEMENT SURVIVORS' EDUCATION BENEFITS,2000-05-16,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-05-16/html/CREC-2000-05-16-pt1-PgS4005-3.htm,60,0,146,S4005-S4006,A000356,mr. ashcroft
754,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, fate seems especially cruel when wonderful people are taken away in the prime of life, and the death of Governor Carnahan is just such a tragedy. Words alone do not fully describe the sorrow Jane and I and all Missourians feel at the loss of our Governor.Mel Carnahan was a good man. He was a decent, caring man. He loved his state, and he fought hard for every person in it. A man who considered public service a high calling, Mel had a quiet, humble demeanor and his commitment to families in Missouri made a difference in the lives of millions of people.A beloved governor, the son of two teachers in the Ozark mountains, Mel worked hard day after day to give every child a chance in life. He was committed to education with a sincere passion.We extend our deepest sympathy to Mel's wife Jean and their three surviving children; our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult moment. Missouri has lost a giant, and, humbly, we will work to ensure that Mel's wonderful, positive, humane spirit lives on in all our lives.,2015-03-16 18:23:24.755609,2015-03-16 18:23:24.755609,Extensions,IN MEMORY OF THE LATE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI GOVERNOR MEL CARNAHAN,2000-10-17,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-17/html/CREC-2000-10-17-pt1-PgE1810.htm,130,0,146,E1810,G000132,mr. gephardt
755,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, last night in the State of the Union message the President set some good goals for America. He talked about a balanced budget, he talked about saving Social Security. He committed himself further to welfare reform; he is for education reform, he is against drugs, he is even for some family tax cuts.The question is not about whether these are the goals we want for America, but how to achieve those goals.For instance, the President said that a family of four that makes less than $35,000 should not pay any Federal income tax if they have high child care costs. Well, I agree. A family of four that makes less than $35,000 should not pay any Federal income tax. But it should not matter whether they have child care costs or not--$35,000 for a family of four is $35,000.Mr. Speaker, we ought to work for those American families, and we ought to work for better solutions for American families.,2015-03-16 18:23:24.916729,2015-03-16 18:23:24.916729,House,ACHIEVING AMERICA'S GOALS,1998-01-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-01-28/html/CREC-1998-01-28-pt1-PgH69-4.htm,2,1,144,H69,B000575,mr. blunt
756,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, in spite of the fact that the United States has the most advanced health care system in the world, 3 percent of our children are born with birth defects. Approximately 150,000 babies are born each year in this country with a serious birth defect.Although some birth defects are minor and have no permanent consequences, others cause permanent disability, which necessitates constant medical care, special education and other services that cost victims and their families countless tears and thousands of dollars each year. All too often serious birth defects result in death. In fact, birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in America today.Next week, the House will consider legislation that could dramatically reduce the incidence of birth defects in America. The Birth Defects Prevention Act, sponsored by Senator Kit Bond and passed by the Senate last year, would direct the Centers for Disease Control to serve as the national clearinghouse for the collection and storage of data on birth defects, help states establish birth defect surveillance programs or improve existing ones, and make grants available to the public and nonprofit organizations to develop and implement birth defect prevention strategies.,2015-03-16 18:23:25.046815,2015-03-16 18:23:25.046815,House,THE BIRTH DEFECTS PREVENTION ACT,1998-03-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-05/html/CREC-1998-03-05-pt1-PgH856.htm,21,1,144,H856,B000575,mr. blunt
757,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rosella Schnakenberg for her fifty years of service to First Community Bank in Ionia. On March 18, 1947, Rosella began working as a teller for the First Community Bank, then the Bank of Ionia. At the time she received a salary of $75 a month. Today she is Vice President and Facility Manager of the Bank and oversees the day-to-day operations.Through the years Rosella has watched the economic ups and downs of the bank and through it all has made sure that people have received quality service and the assistance they need. Watching people start businesses, purchase homes and pay for their children's college education has allowed her to see first hand the help she has given to others.In addition to Rosella's faithful service to her work, she is a community leader in Cole Camp, Missouri. She has been playing the organ at St. John's Lutheran Church in Cole Camp for more than fifty years and volunteers much of her free time to visiting nursing homes so that residents have company. I wish her continued success and congratulate her for fifty years of loyal service. ,2015-03-16 18:23:25.168907,2015-03-16 18:23:25.168907,Senate,RECOGNITION OF ROSELLA SCHNAKENBERG,1998-03-05,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-03-05/html/CREC-1998-03-05-pt1-PgS1478-2.htm,21,0,144,S1478,B000611,mr. bond
758,MO,Richard,Gephardt,D,Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and dedicated representative of working people, Roy Wyse. Roy is retiring as Secretary Treasurer of the United Auto Workers International Union after thirty-six years of leadership in the union.Roy was hired by the Ford Motor Company in 1951, and immediately joined UAW Local 249 in Claycomo, Missouri. After being elected to the shop committee, Roy quickly rose within the UAW leadership. He was elevated to Secretary Treasurer in 1995, the second highest office in the union.The safety and welfare of the working men and women of the UAW have always driven Roy's life. He has been a tireless fighter on their behalf, and his efforts have had a tremendous impact on the ability of working families to hold a secure job, receive a fair paycheck, and raise a family. Roy has worked to help people outside the union as well. His community involvement has ranged from serving as president of a local board of education, teaching Sunday school classes, and working as a volunteer fireman.I applaud Roy's commitment to public service, and wish him and his wife Pat all the best in the years to come.,2015-03-16 18:23:25.290996,2015-03-16 18:23:25.290996,Extensions,IN RECOGNITION OF ROY WYSE,1998-04-28,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-04-28/html/CREC-1998-04-28-pt1-PgE679-2.htm,49,0,144,E679,G000132,mr. gephardt
759,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, it is with great regret that I inform the Members of the House on the passing of Medford R.

While at the University, Med participated in various extracurricular activities and was a four-year varsity letterman in basketball. After graduating from Mizzou with a bachelor's of Science in Education in 1955, Med joined the St. Louis Hawks of the National Basketball Association. Med played for the Hawks from 1955 through 1959--including the 1958 national championship team. He concluded his NBA Career with the Cincinnati Royals from 1959 to 1960. Med coached the Battle Creek Braves of the Northern Professional League from 1966 to 1968.Mr. Park was the Executive Director of the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in Macon, Georgia, and served as the Executive Director of the John Q. Hammons Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in Springfield, Missouri.Mr. Park is survived by his wife Nancy, three sons, and one sister.Mr. Speaker, Medford Park was an inspiration in the Lexington community, and he will be greatly missed by all who knew him.

760,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, did those who supported tax cuts last summer as part of the balanced budget agreement, and oppose them today, last year raid the Social Security fund when they voted for tax cuts? Why was it that last year the tax cuts that were passed while the budget was in a deficit were not a threat to Social Security, but tax cuts while the budget is in surplus are?This is just goofy, Mr. Speaker.The other side is counting yet again on their hopes that seniors will not know the facts, so they can scare them just like they did 2 years ago about cuts in Medicare. Those cuts turned out to be actually increases in Medicare.Even goofier is their obvious bad faith in opposing tax cuts this year, along with their argument that billions and billions of dollars of new spending they support does not raid Social Security.Well, my friends on the other side of the aisle, which is it? Is spending on education, health care, welfare, and the environment a ``raid'' on the Social Security trust fund or not?,2015-03-16 18:23:25.615218,2015-03-16 18:23:25.615218,House,DEMOCRATS' POSITION ON TAX CUT IS GOOFY,1998-09-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-09-26/html/CREC-1998-09-26-pt1-PgH8974-6.htm,131,1,144,H8974-H8975,B000575,mr. blunt
761,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, Darlene Reinkemeyer became executive director of the Missouri Funeral Directors Association in 1992 and almost immediately members noticed something had changed for the better.With Darlene's directing, memberships increased sharply, membership services tripled, and the association's programs for continuing education seminars, licensure, and professional development were enhanced and scheduled on a more frequent basis.The MFDA Newsletter took on a new life with added information and diverse advertising. The newsletter is now regarded as one of the best in the country.Reinkemeyer was a key figure in restoring credibility to the Missouri Funeral Trust by developing effective contracts, folders, and forms and implementing a computerized record keeping system that gave the system new accountability, and reduced costs. The MFT now manages $30 million. The system Reinkemeyer authored has been copied in other States.Darlene also put the Missouri Funeral Directors Association into the information age, too. The MFDA is on the Internet and its offices are computerized. In the last year, she was instrumental in providing the MDFA with new offices and headquarters building. The Association, with Reinkemeyer at the helm, is financially stable with a sound process of planning and acquisition of assets and capital improvements.Darlene Reinkemeyer has decided to leave her position, and funeral home directors in Missouri will miss her.

763,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that there is a term in the vocabulary adequate to describe my level of disgust with this bill. The Republican majority began this process with proposals reported out of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and the Workforce that represented the most pernicious assault on the working poor I have witnessed as a 29-year Member of this body.In response to the chorus of outrage that rang out against those proposals, the majority fabricated window dressing to make their proposals seem more moderate. But this new manager's amendment, rewritten by the Committee on Rules late last night, remains unfair, immoral and unconscionable.Mr. Speaker, I have three fundamental objections to this bill. First, it establishes a new class of workers who would be treated like indentured servants without coverage under the landmark worker protection and civil rights laws. Second, it concocts a scheme of watered-down grievance procedures and remedies that would render millions of workers unprotected from discrimination and exploitation. And finally, Mr. Speaker, it endangers the job security and financial well-being of millions of current public sector employees by establishing a weak set of nondisplacement protections.Here is why this proposal treats poor workers like second-class Americans. It denies so-called community service participants employee status and purports to use the old CWEP Program as precedent. But that program was quite different from the workfare program established in this proposal. Whereas that program had a strong training element, the community service program established by this proposal is work, pure and simple.Community service workers will be employees in every sense of the term. They will sweat like other workers, their children will get sick just like the children of other workers. And these workers have dreams and aspirations for their families just like other workers.But this proposal says no, they are not the same and they do not deserve full respect and dignity. Although they will be employed to perform the same tasks performed by other workers, these welfare workers will be denied the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the many other important Federal laws. And those employed by nonprofit private sector employers will be denied the right to organize or bargain collectively.The grievance procedures established in the rewritten proposal are a house of courts, substantially weaker than protections adopted by the Republicans on the Committee on Education and the Workforce. There is no provision to ensure that the grievances will be fairly heard and adjudicated. In a real blow against due process, there is no appeal from what may well turn out to be a kangaroo court.Here is an example of how outrageous these grievance procedures are. A woman who has been sexually harassed may be required to seek redress from the very agency where the harassment occurred. Under this proposal that woman would not be entitled to a fair hearing, or the right to appeal an adverse decision. What have poor women done to deserve such indignity?Finally, protections that were included in the education and work force proposal to ensure that community service workers are not used as pawns in a ploy to displace existing workers have been gutted by the manager's amendment. As reported by the Committee on Education and the Workforce, a welfare worker could not be assigned to an equivalent job if another individual was on layoff status. That protection has now been effectively stripped. As reported by committee, a welfare worker could not be assigned to a job if a consequence of that assignment was the partial displacement of an existing worker. Those protections have also been deleted.Mr. Speaker, this legislation is nothing short of a bill of exploitation that will leave workers more vulnerable to racism, sexism, and unsafe workplaces. Rather than encouraging work, these provisions demean workers. I urge its resounding defeat.,2015-03-16 18:23:26.027519,2015-03-16 18:23:26.027519,House,BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997,1997-06-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-06-25/html/CREC-1997-06-25-pt1-PgH4416.htm,91,63,143,H4416-H4606,C000488,mr. clay

The Republicans are going to spend $1.4 million of tax money to intimidate labor leaders, harass the Department of Labor, and attempt to repeal labor laws that have protected the rights of workers for over a half a century.This plot was never discussed in a public hearing of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and it was approved by the House oversight committee without any witnesses testifying to its need. Although the majority is trying to dress up their mission statement, the real attempt is to pursue an extremist antiunion agenda. The Republicans are scheming to attack union members as payback for labor union participation in the 1996 elections.

Combined, the Boyer family, four people working five jobs, make about $50,000 a year, middle class by anybody's definition of the word.Under the Democratic tax plan, the Boyers would receive a $1,584 tax cut; under the Republican vision of tax relief the Boyers would receive only $528 in tax cuts.Republicans have taken weeks to reach agreement on a unified tax cut proposal, but for most middle-income families like the Boyers it was not worth waiting for.We hope the President can persuade Republicans to move toward the Democratic tax cut and direct relief into the pockets of the families who truly need it.,2015-03-16 18:23:26.345739,2015-03-16 18:23:26.345739,House,TAX RELIEF FOR FAMILIES WHO TRULY NEED IT,1997-07-24,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-07-24/html/CREC-1997-07-24-pt1-PgH5668-2.htm,106,1,143,H5668,G000132,mr. gephardt
766,MO,Roy,Blunt,R,Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrated the 210th anniversary of the Constitution. The Constitution is different than any other document that was ever devised as a framework for Government on this continent or any other, and the difference in the Constitution is found in the first three words, ``We the people.''No other document ever purported to be the framework for Government and get its right to govern from the people. The Magna Carta started, ``We the Barons of England.'' The Articles of Confederation started, ``We the States.''This document has been the framework that has lasted longer than any other document that has been the framework for Government. It has been copied by country after country.One of the major tenets of the Constitution is the importance of State governments, the importance of communities, the importance of a Federal Government that acts appropriately in this Federal system we have.We will be bringing bills to the House later this year, as the gentleman from California [Mr. Rogan] has pointed out, that I am a cosponsor of, that we have cosponsors of from both sides of the aisle, that talk about giving more decisionmaking back to states, back to communities, and education.

Mr. Mauro has served our community for over 40 years. In 1954 he was an assistant to City Manager L.P. Cookingham. He went on to lead the fight to end segregation at General Hospital. He was the public policy architect behind the vision for combining all the entities on hospital hill and more importantly the collaborative funding sources--that is, city, State, county, Federal, and so forth. No other complex has had such a diverse and complex fund mechanism. Through his work, the economic development of our area thrived. His leadership contributed tirelessly to the campaigns for the Boys and Girls Club, the Genesis School, and in securing the construction of the Deramus Education Pavilion at the Kansas City Zoo.

768,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.I thank very much the experience shared by my colleague who just spoke. I would say to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Etheridge], if North Carolina or any State does not want to use these opportunity scholarships, there is a simple answer. They do not have to under this bill. It is up to them.I want to read a quote from Jonathan Rauch, who was writing in the November 10th New Republic. I think it is applicable to the debate today.``It's hard to get excited about improving rich suburban high schools that act as feeders for Ivy League colleges. However, for poor children trapped in execrable schools, the case is moral rather than merely educational. These kids attend schools which cannot protect their physical safety, much less teach them. To require poor people to go to dangerous, dysfunctional schools that better-off people fled years ago, and that better-off people would never tolerate for their own children--all the while intoning pieties about `saving' public education--is worse than unsound public policy. It is repugnant public policy.'',2015-03-16 18:23:26.802064,2015-03-16 18:23:26.802064,House,HELPING EMPOWER LOW-INCOME PARENTS (HELP) SCHOLARSHIPS AMENDMENTS OF 1997,1997-11-04,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1997-11-04/html/CREC-1997-11-04-pt1-PgH9941-2.htm,152,190,143,H9941-H9965,T000024,mr. talent
769,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, as we have progressed in this House through the appropriation for the education program, especially for our title I program, we have found a continuation of the philosophy on the majority side that these funds for elementary and secondary education can be cut without causing any harm to the students in the school systems throughout the United States, that the majority of the Republicans feel, under the leadership of Newt Gingrich that these funds can be cut and no harm will be done.I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you and other Members of this House do as I have done, and that is to contact your local school districts and talk to them about what a 17- or 20-percent cut in title I funds for remedial reading and reading recovery or math, remedial math, and those programs will do to those local districts.I have done so and I would like to read to you, without naming the names of the school districts, some of the comments that have come from those schools. One says a 17-percent cut in funding will be a cut of $15,000 to $16,000 real program dollars. They currently have two full-time teachers, elementary level, who teach remedial reading and math. Since the calculation for change this year, they actually get more money and will have a little carryover. They plan to use the carryover to fund a reading recovery program. They do not have a summer school program.Another one currently has 35 or 36 full-time teachers, about 18 aides, who serve 400 to 500 students. They deal with remedial reading and math during the regular school year and summer school, which includes pre-kindergarten level, to start a reading recovery program for at-risk first graders which is working out wonderfully. A 20-percent cut, which is what is heard, will be a great impact on their schools. Off the top of his head, the superintendent said that they would do all they could to save the reading recovery, but cuts will be done to regular remedial programs.Another one, currently one of every two teachers with two aides full-time; they deal with two remedial reading classes. Total program costs $75,000 to $80,000 to fund, no math program, no reading recovery program. They have had astounding success with remedial reading, do not want to lose this program, program serves grades 1 through 6. Majority emphasis is on 1, 2, and 3, although it continues to grade 6, and they have students in 4, 5, and 6 who still participate in the program. The majority of students graduate after grade 3. Cuts in the program would hurt this system.Another one currently has 3\1/2\ teachers in grades 1 through 6 teaching remedial reading and math, are anticipating loss of 1 full-time teacher. Each teacher there serves 45 to 60 students. If you lose one teacher, 60 students will not be served in remedial reading. Feels that remedial reading is a good program, has had good results.Here is one from another school district. They get a little over $200,000 in title I funding, have about 7 full-time teachers plus two aides. Figures they would be cut about $40,000. This means a loss of one teacher, probably one aide and one program. Currently have remedial reading and math in extended-day kindergarten and a transition program for first graders. Those who seem to be struggling are placed in classroom with two teachers. Figures the program that would be cut would be the extended-day kindergarten. They currently serve about 200 kids. Said they are not a high-impact district.And there are other local school districts closer by that are high-impact and would have more adverse effects on those.Here is another one. They are every dollar they receive from the title I to directly benefit a child. Currently have three full-time teachers who teach remedial reading and math. Besides regular program during the day, they have had an evening program which provides tutoring. The three teachers serve about 500 students, 25 percent of school population. Cuts in the program funds would directly cut one or more of the teachers. Could not absorb the cuts, and they thank our staff for calling. They say they are quite concerned with it.I have many others here that have answered our questionnaire, and all of them are to the gist that with a couple of exceptions where the school districts are fairly well funded, that they would not be able to replace these programs with local funds, that they would have to do without, and many children would be hurt by these cuts that are being made in education for the title I programs.Every one of them said that these moneys, our Federal dollars, are being used wisely to help educate, they are being used to make sure our children learn as they progress through the elementary grades. And I think it is poundwise, very foolish for their House to continue on the road to cutting education for our youngsters. They are the future of our country. To say we do not need to educate them, I think is a vast mistake.Another thing I would like to comment on is some of these school districts are in very economically low-grade or poor areas, and they need this money. They are not going to be able to replace it with local tax dollars.So I urge the House to restore the funding for our educational programs.,2015-03-16 18:23:26.960175,2015-03-16 18:23:26.960175,House,CUTS IN APPROPRIATIONS FOR EDUCATION,1996-03-13,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-03-13/html/CREC-1996-03-13-pt1-PgH2194-2.htm,34,1,142,H2194-H2195,V000112,mr. volkmer
770,MO,Harold,Volkmer,D,Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the radical Republican majority is still bent on cutting educational funds, especially title I funds. It is mean-spirited. Who does it impact on? Not the local school districts, but it impacts on children; children, preschool children in the first and second grade; children like the two that I visited with and many others in my district while I was out there. These young children, without these reading skills, will be destined to a future that they will not be able to participate in in this great society of ours because they will not be able to read.The Republicans say that we do not need those funds for title I. I say we do. I say that the future of this country is bound by the education that our children receive, and it is necessary that they have the skills of reading and math, and that is what title I provides.I say to the Republicans, let us not be mean-spirited.,2015-03-16 18:23:27.079288,2015-03-16 18:23:27.079288,House,LET US NOT BE MEAN-SPIRITED,1996-04-23,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-23/html/CREC-1996-04-23-pt1-PgH3666-2.htm,53,1,142,H3666,V000112,mr. volkmer
771,MO,Ike,Skelton,D,Mr. Speaker, It has come to my attention that a distinguished career in the banking industry has come to an end.Joe W. Scallorns, bank president of Farmers and Traders Bank, retired recently after over 30 years of serving Missouri's banking needs.Scallorn's distinguished banking career began as a bank collector in Columbia, Missouri while finishing his degree as a student at the University of Missouri. After college, he joined Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as a credit analyst. He returned to Columbia in 1967, eventually rising to the position of Vice President of the First Bank of Commerce and later as President of the First National Bank and Trust Company. He joined Eagle Bank of Highland, Illinois, as its President in 1987. In June 1988, he purchased Farmers and Traders Bank in California, Missouri.Additionally, Joe is active in professional organizations, chairing the committees on Banking Education, Legislative Affairs, and the Political Action Committee of the Missouri Banking Association, also serving on its Board of Directors. He also served on the Government Relations Council of the American Bankers Association and its National BancPac Committee.As he prepares for quieter time with his wife, Fran and his son, Joseph, I know all Members of Congress will join me in paying tribute to my good friend Joe Scallorns and in wishing him the best in the days ahead.,2015-03-16 18:23:27.213360,2015-03-16 18:23:27.213360,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO RETIRING MISSOURI FARMERS AND TRADERS BANK PRESIDENT JOE W.

772,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Yes, that is correct. I am proposing this provision in response to specific concerns I have heard from Missourians.Mr. President, a message that I am hearing from parents and teachers and students is the issue of school discipline. For the past few months my staff and I have been looking into this issue to see if there are changes that can and should be made to the Individuals with Disabilities Act Reauthorization legislation, in order to give local schools the flexibility they need to apply disciplinary measures in a fair, uniform, and logical manner. I will have more to say on this issue when the Senate takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.But one issue has come to my attention that I believe Congress should address right now, and it involves the issue of a school's ability to discipline IDEA students who carry or possess weapons to or at schools.Mr. President, I have proposed a provision within Amendment No. 68 which makes an important addition to a provision in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The revision I propose will ensure that the IDEA legislation accurately reflects the intent of Congress that schools should have the ability to place a child with a disability in an alternative setting for discipline situations involving weapons.Specifically, this provision revises the law to explicitly allow a school to place a child with a disability in an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the child carries a weapon to or possesses a weapon at school, on school premises, or to or at a school function. Currently, the law says that a school could take such action only if the child carries a weapon to school or to a school function.The problem with the current statutory language is that it creates an unintended loophole which could prevent a school from placing a child in an alternative placement if the child at question is in possession of a weapon.Some school boards in my state have expressed concerns about the language in the IDEA reauthorization allowing a 45 day change in placement of a child who ``carries'' a weapon to school. Schools want to know whether that language means they can change the placement of a child whom they found to be in ``possession'' of a weapon, as well as a child found to be simply ``carrying'' the weapon to school. They are afraid that the language of the statute sets up a distinction that is going to create a big loophole which kids can jump through to avoid the 45 day change in placement.Right now, there is a situation in a school district in my state involving two students, both with individualized education programs (IEPs). I have been asked not to name the specific school district at issue because proceedings are still pending on this matter. But here are the facts: Student A carried a weapon into the school and gave it to Student B, who then put the weapon into his (Student B's) locker. The school knew that it could put Student A into an alternative placement, since Student A literally ``carried `` the weapon into school. But could the school also change Student B's placement, since technically he didn't ``carry'' the weapon into school, but instead was simply ``possessing'' it?The school went ahead and also placed Student B in an alternative placement as well. However, the school is now worried that at the pending proceeding, Student B will raise the issue of ``carrying'' as opposed to ``possessing'' the weapon. The school says that it doesn't know how it will be able to get around an argument from the child or his parent that the child did not literally carry the weapon to school.Surely Congress did not intend to set up such a situation in the 1997 IDEA reauthorization. Surely we intended that schools have the ability to place a child in an alternative setting for up to 45 days if the child possessed a weapon on school premises, as well as carried a weapon to the school. And this is why we should pass this amendment: to ensure that schools have the ability to take the appropriate measures against students when weapons are involved.I would like to point out that even the Department of Education has acknowledged that the current statutory language ``carries a weapon to school or to a school function'' is ambiguous, and that it was the clear intent of Congress to cover instances in which the child is found to be in possession of a weapon at school.Now this amendment, if passed, would not apply to the school district in Missouri that is facing this dilemma, since that is a pending case. But we would be addressing this problem for any future situations, providing the clarity that schools, parents, and children need.Mr. President, schools, teachers, principals, and administrators want and need to be able to treat all students on a uniform basis when weapons are involved. We need to be sure that our laws allow a school to remove any student from the regular classroom if that student is found with a weapon at school. We need to close up any loopholes in the law that would prevent a school from taking this immediate action to maintain a safe learning environment for our students.Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join with me in making this vital addition to the IDEA law, so that schools will be able to exercise the authority we intended to give them to maintain a safe school environment for all our children.,2015-03-16 18:23:27.333469,2015-03-16 18:23:27.333469,Senate,EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999,1999-03-11,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-11/html/CREC-1999-03-11-pt1-PgS2556-2.htm,39,139,145,S2556-S2573,A000356,mr. ashcroft

This is an intense engineering competition of highly trained and dedicated federal employees, both military and civilian. The candidates are accomplished in their education, service, and leadership to accomplish their agencies' missions. They have performed above and beyond their job descriptions and represent the best and the brightest among those who work for all the citizens of the United States.Lieutenant Colonel Estes commands the 169th Engineer Battalion at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where he oversees the training, discipline, and management of over 2,000 new soldiers a year in nine different military engineering occupational specialities. He contributes immeasurably to his community by teaching night courses to soldiers and donating that salary to charities and battalion activities. Lieutenant Colonel Estes is a pioneer in the application of system reliability and optimization techniques for engineering structures. His leadership, accomplishments, community service, and participation in professional organizations make him ideally suited for the Federal Engineer of the Year Award.Other finalists for this award who deserve recognition are Gregory M.

774,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,Senator Domenici, first let me reiterate my admiration for the remarkable budget you have produced. You have produced a budget that, in the first decade of the new millennium, balances the entire federal budget, protects Social Security, increases funding for education by 40%, seeks to protect the Social Security surplus from paying for other government operations, reduces federal debt, provides funds requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to strengthen our national defense, and provides an $800 billion tax cut. This is a strong budget that I will support.As you know, I intended to offer an amendment that would eliminate a $2.9 billion deficit currently projected for FY 2000. It appears likely, however, that when the final budget resolution is written and we have the latest budget and economic forecasts, that this deficit will be eliminated and, in fact, the budget will be in surplus. As I understand, the budget resolution, as reported by the committee, provides that any FY 2000 surplus should be devoted to tax cuts.,2015-03-16 18:23:27.611638,2015-03-16 18:23:27.611638,Senate,CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000,1999-03-25,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-03-25/html/CREC-1999-03-25-pt2-PgS3385-2.htm,48,320,145,S3385-S3432,A000356,mr. ashcroft

The number is vast, with 13 or 14 percent in Tennessee, and 13 or 14 percent of the students in Missouri and Iowa. These are not people who show up for school with guns very often. When some of them do, they are threatening the others.When a person shows up with explosives or a gun at school, the objective there ought to be school safety. It ought to be to address that.The amendment provides school officials with the discretion to suspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in the same manner as other students in cases where they bring firearms to school.It has been stated there is a lot of opposition.

When you suggest that there is an equity for those who are subject to an IEP, but the violation is not a manifestation of the disability, that there is not any requirement for services, that is simply not true. The law provides the services must continue.I think the fundamental point the Senator from Tennessee and I want to make is this. There are not very many people who are bringing guns to school. There are very few of them. And even fewer who would bring guns or pipe bombs to school are students with a disability.But for those who do, the school officials ought not to have to go through torturous legal proceedings and laborious determinations of manifestations and the like for those who bring pipe bombs and guns to school.

780,MO,Christopher,Bond,R,Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. I wanted to take a few minutes to share with my colleagues the very clear, overwhelming message I received as I traveled over the State of Missouri and met with teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, and school board members. They asked me a very simple question: Why is it the people in Washington know so much more about our needs than we do? How are you, in Washington, DC, so smart, to know that what we really need is more teachers?I can tell you instance after instance where, for example, they say: Look, we are in a small school. We only have so many classrooms. We cannot put another teacher in those classrooms. What we need is more equipment. Do not give us the money for a teacher for whom we do not have a classroom, or do not give us more money for another teacher when our salaries are so low we have to raise all the teachers' salaries in order to make sure we keep good people in teaching. It is not just quantity. In a lot of these areas it is getting the money to pay for quality teachers. That is why I believe the Gorton proposal is the way to go.I have talked to those in small school districts who say: Do you know what we would get? We would get .17 of a teacher, 17 percent of a teacher. That makes a pretty poor teacher, when you have only 17 percent of the teacher. They have not quite figured out how to usefully employ seventeen one-hundredths of a teacher.But that is the extreme case. The real case, time and time again, is that this is viewed in school districts around my State, and I suggest it would be viewed that way in your own States if you asked them, that Washington is not so smart as to know what each district--whether it is North Callaway or the Scotts Corner or the Martinsburg-Wellsville-Middletown School District needs another half a teacher, or a teacher-and-a-half. Those decisions should be made by the school boards that represent and serve the parents of the district who employ the superintendents and the principals and the teachers.I proposed something called a direct check for education, which is molded on the work of my colleague, Senator Gorton. That has had overwhelming support from people who actually do the job of teaching our students. We entrust the future of our students to these people. Then we come in from Washington, DC, and say: We are a lot smarter; we know what you need in the school district. One size does not fit all. Washington's solution is not right in every school district. I can assure you of that. I can assure you the people who are responsible, the people who are elected--usually by the constituents in that district, the patrons of the school district--want to see the best for their children.Do you know what bugs them? Do you know what is causing them problems? It is all the time and energy they waste in filling out the forms on how they used that 17 percent of a teacher. Filling out those reports, sending them to Washington to keep more bureaucrats busy, does not educate a child or teach the child to read. It doesn't help that child figure out multiplication or division or even to learn about science and history. We need to get the Federal redtape and regulations and misdirected priorities off the backs of the schools that are laboring to teach our kids.If you have any confidence at all in public education, public education in America today is, and must be, controlled at the local level. Yes, it is a national priority. It must be a national priority.I commended President Bush when he set out to start the work of raising the standards and the expectations for everybody in America to improve our education system. That is a national priority. But it is a local responsibility. Let us not impose our will on local officials, school board officials, parents, principals, and the teachers on how to spend that money.I think this is a clear-cut case where we want to trust the people who teach our kids. They know the kids' names, they know the kids' problems, and they know the kids' opportunities.I urge support of the Gorton amendment.

781,MO,William,Clay,D,Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, I am at a loss to understand why the gentleman would exclude Title I from factoring in the administrative costs when it is the largest education program in the country, $8 billion. And when we factor in the ESEA to Title I funding, my figures are correct. Ninety-nine percent of the Federal money goes to the States, and 94 percent of that goes to the classroom.The problem the gentleman from Pennsylvania has is with his State agency. IDEA, when we send Federal money to the State, the State keeps 25 percent of it instead of sending it on to the LEAs or the local LEAs or to the classroom. When the national average for that money is 13.5 percent, what is the State of Pennsylvania doing with the other 13.5 percent, the other 12.5 percent? That is where his problem is, and that is where he ought to be trying to get the State legislature to do something about that.Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Martinez).(Mr. MARTINEZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.),2015-03-16 18:23:28.707418,2015-03-16 18:23:28.707418,House,SENSE OF THE HOUSE URGING 95 PERCENT OF FEDERAL EDUCATION DOLLARS BE SPENT IN THE CLASSROOM,1999-10-12,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-10-12/html/CREC-1999-10-12-pt1-PgH9843-2.htm,137,7,145,H9843-H9847,C000488,mr. clay
782,MO,James,Talent,R,Mr. Speaker, I insert the following eloquent speech entitled ``the True Goal of Education'' into the Congressional Record.It is a pleasure to be here, and to join in marking the chamber's Business Appreciation Month. New Hampshire is a state of small businesses. Many of them here in the north country are prospering, and this organization has played an important part. I am honored by your invitation. I am an optimist, I believe that the next century will be a time of incredible prosperity--if we can create an environment where entrepreneurs like you can dream and flourish. A prosperity sustained by low taxes, unleashed by lighter regulation, energized by new technologies, expanded by free trade. A prosperity beyond all our expectations, but within our grasp. But this hope, in the long-run, depends directly on the education of our children--on young men and women with the skills and character to succeed. So for the past few months, I have focused on the problems and promise of our public schools. In September, I talked about disadvantaged children left behind by failed schools. The diminished hopes of our current system are sad and serious--the soft bigotry of low expectations. Schools that do not teach and will not change must have some final point of accountability. A moment of truth, when their federal funds, intended to help the poorest children, are divided up and given to parents--for tutoring or a charter school or some other hopeful option. Last month, I talked about raising the academic ambitions of every public school in America--creating a culture of achievement. My plan lifts the burden of bureaucracy, and gives states unprecedented freedom in spending federal education dollars. In return for this flexibility, each state must adopt a system of real accountability and high standards. Students must be tested on the basics of reading and math each year--and those results posted, by school, on the Internet. This will give parents the information to know if education is actually taking place--and the leverage to demand reform. My education proposals are bound by a thread of principle. The federal government must be humble enough to stay out of the day-to-day operation of local schools. It must be wise enough to give states and school districts more authority and freedom. And it must be strong enough to require proven performance in return. The federal role in education is to foster excellence and challenge failure with charters and choice. The federal role in education is not to serve the system. It is to serve the children. Yet this is only part of an agenda. Yes, we want our children to be smart and successful. But even more, we want them to be good and kind and decent. Yes, our children must learn how to make a living. But even more, they must learn how to live, and what to love. ``Intelligence is not enough,'' said Martin Luther King, Jr. ``Intelligence plus character--that is the true goal of education.'' So today, here in New Hampshire, I want to make the case for moral education. Teaching is more than training, and learning is more than literacy. Our children must be educated in reading and writing--but also in right and wrong. Of course, every generation worries about the next. ``Children today are tyrants,'' said one educator. ``They contradict their parents, gobble their food, and tyrannize their teachers.'' And that teacher's name was . . . Socrates. Some things don't change. The real problem comes, not when children challenge the rules, but when adults won't defend the rules. And for about three decades, many American schools surrendered this role. Values were ``clarified,'' not taught. Students were given moral puzzles, not moral guidance. But morality is not a cafeteria of personal choices--with every choice equally right and equally arbitrary, like picking a flavor of ice cream. We do not shape our own morality. It is morality that shapes our lives. Take an example. A Massachusetts teacher--a devoted supporter of values clarification--had a sixth grade class which announced that it valued cheating, and wanted the freedom to express that value during tests. Her response? ``I personally value honesty,'' she said. ``Although you may choose to be dishonest, I will insist that we be honest on our tests here. In other areas of your life, you may have to be dishonest.'' This is not moral neutrality. It is moral surrender. Our schools should not cultivate confusion. They must cultivate conscience. In spite of conflicting signals--and in spite of a popular culture that sometimes drowns their innocence--most of our kids are good kids. Large numbers do volunteer work. Nearly all believe in God, and most practice their faith. Teen pregnancy and violence are actually going down. Across America, under a program called True Love Waits, nearly a million teens have pledged themselves to abstain from sex until marriage. Our teenagers feel the pressures of complex times, but also the upward pull of a better nature. They deserve our love and they deserve our encouragement. And sometimes they show character and courage beyond measure. When a gun is aimed at a seventeen-year-old in Colorado--and she is shot for refusing to betray her Lord. When a seventeen-year-old student, during a madman's attack on a Fort Worth church, is shot while shielding a friend with Downs Syndrome--and continues to comfort her, even after her own injury. We are finding, in the midst of tragedy, that our children can be heroes too. Yet something is lost when the moral message of schools is mixed and muddled. Many children catch a virus of apathy and cynicism. They lose the ability to make confident judgments-- viewing all matters of right and wrong as a matter of opinion. Something becomes frozen within them--a capacity for indignation and empathy. You can see it in shrugged shoulders. You can hear it in the watchword of a generation: ``Whatever,'' Academics like Professor Robert Simon report seeing many students--nice, well-intentioned young men and women--who refuse to make judgments even about the Holocaust. ``Of course I dislike the Nazis,'' he quotes a student, ``but who is to say they are morally wrong?'' At the extreme, in the case of a very few children-- lawless, loveless and lonely--this confusion can harden into self-destruction or evil, suicide or violence. They find no elevating ideals--from parents or church or school--to counter the chaos in their souls. ``We laugh at honor,'' said C.S. Lewis, ``and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.'' But something is changing in this country. Perhaps we have been sobered by tragedy. Perhaps the Baby Boom generation has won some wisdom from its failures and pain. But we are no longer laughing at honor. ``Values clarirfication'' seems like a passing superstition. Many states have instituted real character education in their schools, and many more are headed in that direction. After decades of drift, we are beginning a journey of renewal. Above all, we are relearning a sense of idealism for our children. Parents and teachers are rediscovering a great calling and a heavy burden: to write on the slate of souls. We must tell our children--with conviction and confidence-- that the authors of the Holocaust were evil men, and the authors of the Constitution were good ones. That the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not a personal opinion, but an eternal truth. And we must tell our children--with clarity and certainty-- that character gives direction to their gifts and dignity to their lives. That life is too grand and important to be wasted on whims and wants, on getting and keeping. That selfishness is a dark dungeon. That bigotry disfigures the heart. That they were made for better things and higher goals. The shape of our society, the fate of our country, depends on young men and women who know these things. And we must teach them. I know this begins with parents. And I know that is easy for a politician to say. Mark Twain once commented, ``To do good is noble. To instruct others in doing good is just as noble, and much easier.'' But the message of our society must be clear. When a man or woman has a child, being a father or mother becomes their most important job in life. Not all teachers are parents, but all parents are teachers. Family is the first school of manners and morals. And the compass of conscience is usually the gift of a caring parent. Yet parents should expect schools to be allies in the moral education of children. The lessons of the home must be reinforced by the standards of the school--standards of safety, discipline and decency. Effective character education should not just be an hour a week on a school's virtue of the month. Effective character education is fostered in schools that have confidence in their own rules and values. Schools that set limits, enforce boundaries, teach high ideals, create habits of good conduct. Children take the values of the adult worlds seriously when adults take those values seriously. And this goal sets an agenda for our nation. First, we must do everything in our power to ensure the safety of our children. When children and teenagers go to school afraid of being bullied, or beaten, or worse, it is the ultimate betrayal of adult responsibility. It communicates the victory of moral chaos. In an American school year there are more than 4,000 rapes or cases of sexual battery; 7,000 robberies; and 11,000 physical attacks involving a weapon. And these are overall numbers. For children attending inner-city schools, the likelihood of being a victim of violence is roughly five times greater than elsewhere. It is a sign of the times that the same security company used by the U.S. Mint and the FBI has now branched out into high-school security. Surveying this scene, it is easy to forget that there is actually a federal program designed to confront school violence. It's called the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The program spends about $600 million dollars a year, assisting 97 percent of the nation's school districts. What's missing from the program is accountability. Nobody really knows how the money is spent, much less whether it is doing any good. One newspaper found that federal money had gone to pay for everything from motivational speakers to clowns to school puppet shows to junkets for school administrators. As president, I will propose major changes in this program. Every school getting this funding will report their results-- measured in student safety. Those results will be public. At schools that are persistently dangerous, students will be given a transfer to some other school--a safe school. No parent in America--no matter their income--should be forced to send their child to a school where violence reigns. No child in America--regardless of background--should be forced to risk their lives in order to learn. In the same way, it is a federal crime for a student to bring a gun into any public school. Yet this law has been almost completely ignored by federal prosecutors in recent years. Of some 3,900 violations reported between 1997 and 1998, only 13 were prosecuted. It is easy to propose laws. Sometimes it is easy to pass laws. But the measure of our seriousness is enforcing the law. And the safety of our children merits more than lip service. Here is what I'll do. We will form a new partnership of the federal government and states--called Project Sentry. With some additional funding for prosecutors and the ATF, we can enforce the law and prosecute the violators: students who use guns illegally or bring guns to school, and adults who provide them. And for any juvenile found guilty of a serious gun offense, there will be a lifetime ban on carrying or purchasing a gun--any gun, for any reason, at any age, ever. Tougher enforcement of gun laws will help to make our schools safer. But safety is not the only goal here. The excellence of a school is not just measured by declines in robbery, murder, and aggravated assault. Safety is the first and urgent step toward a second order of business--instilling in all of our public schools the virtues of discipline. More than half of secondary-school teachers across the country say they have been threatened, or shouted at, or verbally abused by students. A teacher in Los Angeles describes her job as ``nine-tenths policeman, one-tenth educational.'' And many schools, intimidated by the threat of lawsuits, have watered down their standards of behavior. In Oklahoma, a student who stabbed a principal with a nail was suspended for three days. In North Carolina, a student who broke her teacher's arm was suspended for only two days. In too many cases, adults are in authority, but they are not in control. To their credit, many schools are trying to reassert that control--only to find themselves in court. Generations of movies from The Blackboard Jungle to Stand and Deliver cast as their hero the teacher who dares to bring discipline to the classroom. But a modern version of this drama would have to include a new figure in the story--the lawyer. Thirty-one percent of all high schools have faced lawsuits or out-of-court settlements in the past 2 years. This is seriously deterring discipline, and demands a serious response. In school districts receiving federal school safety funds, we will expect a policy of zero-tolerance for persistently disruptive behavior. This means simply that teachers will have the authority to remove from their classroom any student who persists in being violent or unruly. Only with the teacher's consent will these students be allowed to return. The days of timid pleading and bargaining and legal haggling with disruptive students must be over. Learning must no longer be held hostage to the brazen behavior of a few. Along with this measure, I will propose a Teacher Protection Act to free teachers, principals and school board members from meritless federal lawsuits when they enforce reasonable rules. School officials, acting in their official duties, must be shielded from liability. A lifetime dedicated to teaching must not be disrupted by a junk lawsuit. We do not need tort lawyers scouring the halls of our schools-- turning every classroom dispute into a treasure hunt for damage awards. Safety and discipline are essential. But when we dream for our children, we dream with higher goals. We want them to love learning. And we want them to be rich in character and blessed in ideals. So our third goal is to encourage clear instruction in right and wrong. We want our schools to care about the character of our children. I am not talking about schools promoting a particular set of religious beliefs. Strong values are shared by good people of different faiths, of varied backgrounds. I am talking about communicating the values we share, in all our diversity. Respect. Responsibility. Self-restraint. Family commitment. Civic duty. Fairness. Compassion. The moral landmarks that guide a successful life. There are a number of good programs around the country that show how values can be taught in a diverse nation. At St. Leonard's Elementary School in Maryland, children take a pledge each morning to be ``respectful, responsible and ready to learn.'' Character education is a theme throughout the curriculum--in writing, social studies and reading. And discipline referrals were down by 70 percent in one year. At Marion Intermediate school in South Carolina, virtues are taught by studying great historical figures and characters in literature. Consideration is encouraged, good manners are expected. And discipline referrals are down by half in one year. The federal government now spends $8 million on promoting character education efforts. My administration will triple that funding--money for states to train teachers and incorporate character lessons into daily coursework. We will require federal youth and juvenile justice programs to incorporate an element of character building. Our government must get its priorities straight when it comes to the character of our children. Right now, the Department of Health and Human Services spends far more on teen contraception than it does on teen abstinence. It takes the jaded view that children are nothing more than the sum of their drives, with no higher goal than hanging out and hooking up. We owe them better than this--and they are better than this. They ask for bread, and we give them a stone. Abstinence programs show real promise--exactly because more and more teenagers understand that true love waits. My administration will elevate abstinence education from an afterthought to an urgent goal. We should spend at least as much each year on promoting the conscience of our children as we do on providing them with contraception. As well, we will encourage and expand the role of charities in after-school programs. Everyone agrees there is a problem in these empty, unsupervised hours after school. But those hours should not only be filled with sports and play, they should include lessons in responsibility and character. The federal government already funds afterschool programs. But charities and faith-based organizations are prevented from participating. In my administration they will be invited to participate. Big Brothers/Big Sisters, the YMCA and local churches and synagogues and mosques should be a central part of voluntary, after-school programs. Schools must never impose religion--but they must not oppose religion either. And the federal government should not be an enemy of voluntary expressions of faith by students. Religious groups have a right to meet before and after school. Students have a right to say grace before meals, read their Bibles, wear Stars of David and crosses, and discuss religion with other willing students. Students have a right to express religious ideas in art and homework. Public schools that forbid these forms of religious expression are confused. But more than that, they are rejecting some of the best and finest influences on young lives. It is noble when a young mind finds meaning and wisdom in the Talmud or Koran. It is good and hopeful when young men and women ask themselves what would Jesus do. The measure of our nation's greatness has never been affluence or influence--rising stocks or advancing armies. It has always been found in citizens of character and compassion. And so many of our problems as a nation--from drugs, to deadly diseases, to crime--are not the result of chance, but of choice. They will only be solved by a transformation of the heart and will. This is why a hopeful and decent future is found in hopeful and decent children. That hope, of course, is not created by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress. I strongly believe our schools should reinforce good character. I know that our laws will always reflect a moral vision. But there are limits to law, set at the boundaries of the heart. It has been said: ``Men can make good laws, but laws can not make men good.'' Yet a president has a broader influence and a deeper legacy than the programs he proposes. He is more than a bookkeeper or an engineer of policy. A president is the most visible symbol of a political system that Lincoln called ``the last best hope of earth.'' The presidency, said Franklin Roosevelt, is ``preeminently a place of moral leadership.'' That is an awesome charge. It is the most sobering part of a decision to run for president. And it is a charge I plan to keep. After power vanishes and pride passes, this is what remains: The promises we kept. The oath we fulfilled. The example we set. The honor we earned. This is true of a president or a parent. Of a governor or a teacher. We are united in a common task: to give our children a spirit of moral courage. This is not a search for scapegoats--it is a call to conscience. It is not a hopeless task--it is the power and privilege of every generation. Every individual can change a corner of our culture. And every child is a new beginning. In all the confusion and controversy of our time, there is still one answer for our children. An answer as current as the headlines. An answer as old as the scriptures. ``Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.'' If we love our children, this is the path of duty--and the way of hope.

The latter award recognizes excellence in teaching, scholarship, and service.In these last two categories, scholarship and service, Nickell has gone above and beyond his responsibilities in the classroom. An avid promoter of regional history, he helped initiate the university's Historic Preservation program, through which undergraduate and graduate students work to preserve the area's historic sites, artifacts, and cultures. In 2007, he helped launch and became host of Southeast Public Radio's ``Almost Yesterday'' series, which takes listeners back in time to specific moments in regional history.

797,MO,Claire,McCaskill,D,Mr. President, I very rarely am motivated to come to the floor simultaneously with current events, thinking that it is important to reflect and learn as much as possible about a subject before one begins to orate about it on the Senate floor. I am making an exception, however, because of the extraordinarily heinous acts that have occurred in the country of Nigeria.I think it takes everyone's breath away in the United States of America that a terrorist organization--Boko Haram--would attack a secondary school in northeastern Nigeria and kidnap 200 girls. Most of these girls are not that much younger than my daughters. These were young women who wanted nothing more than to get an education. We are now told these terrorists have proudly proclaimed they will enslave these young women, they will sell them as slaves. They are proudly taking credit for this despicable and inhumane act.I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins for organizing a letter to the President to urge him to include Boko Haram in the United Nations Al Qaeda sanctions list. I thank the other Senators who introduced the resolution we passed this afternoon condemning this attack. But we have to do more.It concerns me, honestly, that this is occurring in a country where the leader not too long ago signed into law a measure that anyone entering into a homosexual relationship can be imprisoned for up to 14 years. In this same country we have a terrorist organization capturing young women and enslaving them for dollars to be child brides, proudly proclaiming that it is a sin for these young women to want to get an education, that this action was necessary to purge them of their sins and marry them off.I understand it takes all kinds of people to make up this great world. I understand there are all kinds of beliefs. But it is very hard for me to get my arms around the notion that there could be any faith that would believe kidnapping young women by the hundreds and selling them as indentured slaves to men could ever be part of any kind of faith that we should recognize. These are not people of faith; these are heinous criminals. I believe our country should look at them as archenemies of who we are as a nation and what we stand for as a government.The name of this organization means ``Western education is a sin.'' Respect for young women is not a sin. Wanting an education is not a sin. The opportunity to better oneself is not a sin.These incredible crimes that have been committed should not go unanswered, and I think it is incumbent on our Nation, with the great resources we have, to make sure we send the appropriate message to the world that this is Al Qaeda and this is our enemy--not just to our values and our way of life but, importantly, an enemy to innocent young women.I wanted to come to the floor to make this statement because I cannot imagine how the parents of these young girls must be feeling and how helpless the feeling must be. I can only hope and pray that the Government of Nigeria realizes this is a moment of truth for them. Will they stand up to this kind of extremism that is not faith? They do a disservice to their professed faith by these actions. Can this country stand up to them, can we help them stand up to them and, most importantly, can we do anything to save these young women?When I go to bed tonight I will, in my faith, thank God for my family and my children, and I will also ask for prayers for these young women in hopes they can be rescued, that they can be reunited with their desire to get educated, and that their families will not have to spend days wondering if they will ever see their children again or if their children will even survive.I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.,2015-03-16 18:23:30.949014,2015-03-16 18:23:30.949014,Senate,ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2014--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued,2014-05-06,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-05-06/html/CREC-2014-05-06-pt1-PgS2700.htm,67,18,160,S2700-S2706,M001170,mrs. mccaskill
