52,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,"[""Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senior Senator from Missouri for his introduction of the ``Direct Check for Education'' bill. It is with great pleasure that I add my name as a cosponsor of this important legislation, which will improve the educational opportunities for our nation's school children by sending federal resources directly to local school districts to use in the way they know will benefit students most effectively."", ""Mr. President, when we talk about education, we should start by asking: ``What do our parents want for their children? We know that parents want their children to get a first-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. Parents want schools that are safe, classes that are small, and principals and teachers to have authority to make the right decisions in all areas of learning, school discipline and after-school activities. Parents want teachers who care for students and know the subjects they teach. Parents do not want Washington in control of classrooms."", ""The next question we should ask is: How can we attain what parents want? How can our children achieve academic excellence? The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question in a report released in July of 1998, called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The Subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives, but instead were characterized by: parental involvement in the education of their children, local control, emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance."", ""Knowing the ingredients of educational success for our children, we must next ask whether our current federal education programs contain these ingredients."", ""First, we should observe that in a sense, the federal government has played conflicting roles in education, providing resources with one hand, while creating obstacles with the other. We have spent over $12 billion on major education programs in the last two years, and this year, we are slated to spend nearly $15 billion. Yet, if current trends continue, only about 65% of federal education dollars will be spent this year on educating our children, due to the excessive bureaucracy in our federal programs."", ""And we should remember that federal funding accounts for only about 7% of the total amount spent on education, while the lion's share comes from state and local taxes. However, that 7% of the funding pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts need to administer education programs. Unfortunately, most federal education programs often do not contain the basic ingredients for educational success, but rather contain components that can actually stifle the ingredients for success."", ""In the last 35 years, the federal government has continued to take away parental involvement, local control, flexibility, and teacher and community input by spinning a complex web of federal elementary and secondary education programs, each of which contain their own set of rules that consume the time and resources of states and school districts."", ""A 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total education funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to oversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar."", ""Many federal programs have taken away precious dollars and teacher time. Rather than being able to spend time on classroom preparation, teachers instead have to spend hours filling out federal forms to comply with federal rules."", ""Another problem with a number of our federal education programs is that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars that their parents pay for education. This is because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. In essence, local schools must come to Washington and beg for the money taxpayers sent to the federal treasury. As a result, smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer, cannot share in the money their parents sent to the federal government."", ""To make matters worse, once a school district is successful in obtaining a competitive grant after a harrowing application process, it must spend countless hours and resources complying with the leviathan of regulations and rules attached to the grant."", ""Competitive funding, along with the vast number of federal education programs, has led to a cottage industry in selling information on education program descriptions, filing instructions, and application deadlines for each of these programs. The ``Education at a Crossroads'' report I mentioned earlier describes this cottage industry:"", ""``The Education Funding Research Council identifies potential sources of funds for local school districts, and sells for nearly $400 the Guide to Federal Funding for Education. The company promises to steer its subscribers to ``a wide range of Federal programs,'' and offers these subscribers timely updates on ``500 education programs.'' More recently, the Aid for Education Report published by CD Publications advertised that ``huge sums are available. . .in the federal government alone, there are nearly 800 different education programs that receive authorization totaling almost a hundred billion dollars.''"", ""It's a shame that a school district has to pay $400 for a catalog to learn how to get back the money that its community has sent to Washington to educate its children. But sadly, this is often the case."", ""A third problem we can identify with many current federal education programs is that federal dollars are often earmarked for one particular use, and cannot be used for any other purpose. This inflexible funding hurts schools that have other needs than the ones prescribed by the federal government. A recent example of this is the $1.2 billion earmarked last year for classroom size reduction. While more teachers and class size reduction are noble endeavors, some schools don't need more teachers, but instead need more computers. However, the only use of this $1.2 billion can be for hiring more teachers. Such a policy flies in the face of one ingredient for educational success, local control."", ""So, we know we have created a lot of federal education programs and we have dedicated a great deal of resources for these programs. What results are we getting? The National Center for Education Statistics' NAEP 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States reveals that 40 percent of fourth graders do not read at a basic level. The same report also indicates that half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time, if at all. And the NAEP Report Card also shows that United States 12th graders only outperformed two out of 21 nations in mathematics. The Brookings Institution released a study in April of 1998 indicating that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students."", ""Knowing these disastrous results, we cannot afford to keep spending our federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing for years if it's not stimulating academic success. Parents, teachers, school boards, and members of our community won't stand for this kind of failure. They want and need opportunities to be more involved in deciding how to spend the federal education dollar, because they know what works. We must spend our federal resources for elementary and secondary education in ways that embrace the ingredients of success."", ""Rather than fund the patchwork of federal elementary and secondary education programs that Washington wants, Congress should send that money directly to local school districts. Parents and teachers need the financing, flexibility and freedom to fund programs they know will improve their children's education."", ""Senator Bond's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal does just this. He takes some of the Department of Education's largest competitive grant programs and returns the money in the form of a ``direct check'' to the local school districts based on the number of students in each district. Schools may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement."", ""Under the ``Direct Check'' proposal, no longer would school districts have to come to Washington and beg for the money they sent to Washington to educate their children. No longer would teachers and administrators have to spend countless and wasted hours filling out federal grant application and compliance forms. No longer would schools be forced to earmark federal dollars for programs that have no relevance to their students' needs. Rather, school districts with the input of teachers, school boards, administrators, and of course, parents, would have the authority and flexibility to use federal dollars for what they best see fit."", ""For example, local schools could deploy resources to hire new teachers, raise teacher salaries, buy new textbooks or new computers--whatever the schools deem most important to the educational success of their students. The Direct Check to Education proposals gives schools more time, flexibility, and money to spend on what's most important: providing classroom instruction to our nation's children."", ""With the flexible, equitable distribution of federal funding under Senator Bond's proposal comes accountability. Local school districts will be penalized for knowingly submitting false information regarding the number of students in their districts. Moreover, the Secretary of Education may audit local educational agency expenditures to ensure that funds are used in accordance with the Direct Check in Education Act. And most importantly, parents, school boards, and members of the community will be able to give direct input into funding decisions, since those decisions will be made right in the community, rather than hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of miles away in Washington, D.C. Local decision making allows for local accountability."", ""Mr. President, we have learned from experience that our many of our current federal education programs and dollars are not producing what we expect for our students. We know that successful education programs occur when crucial decisions are made by local communities, teachers, school boards, and parents. This is why I support Senator Bond's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal. His plan embraces the ingredients of educational success, as it gives parents, teachers and school boards the authority and flexibility to direct funds to programs they know work for their children."", ""As I said earlier, Senator Bond's proposal consolidates a number of the Department of Education's federal programs for elementary and secondary education. I believe we should explore whether other federal education programs--both within and outside the Department of Education--should also be taken and put into a ``direct check'' to our local school districts. We must continue to look for ways to direct our federal resources in ways that reflect the ingredients of success and educational excellence for our children."", "" By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):"", ""S. 53.

I know for sure I did not vote that way in 1995, since I was not here in 1995."", ""Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment about whether we are going to increase funding for OSHA or increase funding for vocational education. It is $11 million, the increase in the OSHA bill. Apparently, the vocational education, adult education appropriation had no increase."", ""At one time, in the early information that we received, it said that there was an $11 million decrease in vocational education. That got me to thinking about why at a time when we are focusing on welfare reform, when we are focusing on getting people to work, when we have just made the significant steps we made to encourage education beyond high school with the tax bill that many of the people who are speaking against this amendment were appropriately and actively for, we would want to just leave vocational education in place and perhaps even cut vocational education, as the early analysis of the bill said we were going to do."", ""Mr. Chairman, assuming vocational education is where it was last year, and we have $11 million, the question that this amendment really brings to the floor is whether we take that $11 million and spend it for more OSHA or we take that $11 million and spend it for more vocational and adult education."", ""This process is about choices. This amendment proposes a different choice than the choice presented by the committee. I am a believer in vocational education. I think vocational education may very well, one could argue, be more important than it has ever been as we try to move people to the workplace that have not been to the workplace."", ""Clearly, OSHA is not achieving the results in the workplace that we want to achieve. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Clay], who mentioned the numbers of deaths appropriately, we should be concerned about those numbers of deaths. But the gentleman also mentioned that there are inspectors in OSHA that would allow every business to be inspected only once every 167 years."", ""Mr. Chairman, I think a better way to provide workplace safety, even these two choices, is to train people before they go to the workplace so that they are better prepared to be there. I think that is a better effort to get workplace safety than an $11 million increase in OSHA would be."", ""Certainly, the vocational education reforms that this Congress will approve spend money more nearly at the local level. I think that is a good change in vocational education. Ninty percent of the money will be spent for the first time under these new guidelines at the local level. This will be money that is spent to strengthen academics, to broaden opportunities after high school, to send more dollars to classrooms for people who are not headed to college."", ""Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of American youth do not complete a 4-year college degree. Those people are very much in need of additional beyond-high school training."", ""Mr. Chairman, it is clear that more than half of the new jobs that have been and will be created in the decade of the 1990s will take education beyond high school. Well, 25 to 35 percent of the people going to high school are not graduating from high school to start with in virtually any State. The 75 percent that do not graduate from college need that additional training to fill the jobs that are created in this decade, for many of them their first decade in the workplace."", ""I think vocational education is important. I think adult education is important. By the way, this amendment does not say to take the money out of compliance or even to take it out of inspection. It takes the money out of OSHA and puts money in the Perkins bill vocational education."", ""Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of that money goes to vocational education; 10 percent goes to programs for single parents; 8 percent to State level programs and activities; and 5 percent for State administration.

After all, who is in a better position to know what each child needs--a bureaucratic Washington government or the parents and teachers who see that child every day?"", ""This bill does more than just create Educational Savings Accounts.

And there has been a constant debate about how to make them work.'' I know that since I was elected to the United States Senate 12 years ago I have listened and participated in the many debates on public education that have occurred in this institution. I have even had some ideas of my own on how to improve education--some of which have been passed by this body and signed into law."", ""My intentions, like those of my Senate colleagues--have been good intentions. We all share the same goal of providing our children with a great education. We have been trying to do the right thing."", ""Today, however, our good intentions have mushroomed into burdensome regulations, unfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. Parents, teachers, and local school officials have less and less control over what happens in the classroom. Instead of empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials we have empowered the federal government and bureaucrats. We have slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation on the local level and have once again established a system where supposedly the Olympians on the hill know what is best for the peasants in the valley."", ""Mr. President, let me give you some examples of what our good intentions have gotten us."", ""We have 760 education programs scattered throughout 39 different federal agencies. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review said that the Department of Education's discretionary grant process lasts 26 weeks and takes 487 steps from start to finish. The General Accounting Office has estimated that there are nearly 13,400 full-time jobs in the 50 states funded by the Department of Education with an additional 4,600 direct Department of Education employees."", ""We have teachers being taken off the task of teaching, preparing lesson plans, taking on after school student activities, etc. and instead are researching for grant opportunities, reading regulations, preparing applications, filling out paperwork requirements, complying with cumbersome rules, and reporting on how they spend the federal money received. Or we have teachers and administrators deciding that the extra federal money is not worth the time and effort that it will take to get and comply with that they do not even bother to go through the process."", ""Most of us are now aware of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, released last year by the National Center for Education Statistics, that ranked American senior high school students 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in math, and 16th out of the same 21 countries in science. In addition, 40 percent of our Nation's fourth graders do not read at even a basic level. Colleges across this country are spending over $1 billion a year in remedial education."", ""Is this acceptable? Are we satisfied with the status quo? The answer should be--must be--an unequivocal NO."", ""In our business we pay a lot of attention to polls. For several years, the polls across the country have been telling us that we have a problem with public education. This is not new news and the question remains the same: How do we fix public education?"", ""Mr. President, before I provide my answer to that question I want to take this opportunity to read from an editorial from a home-state newspaper, the Southeast Missourian."", ""Nearly a decade ago, then-President Bush and the nation's governors set a series of goals for America's schoolchildren in reading, math, graduation rates and other measures. But the national education goals panel says the nation's public schools will fall short of the goals for 2000. We can only hope these continued failures to improve education will result in a overthrow of the so-called experts. These are the people, usually far removed from the classroom, who embrace quick fixes and fads in the face of each hand-wringing report. Unfortunately, the fixes make the problems worse. What's needed is to return America's schools back to the basics and back to local teachers, administrators, school boards, and parents. Without a foundation in the basics, the rest of education just won't take. We must take so-called remedies out of the hands of the federal government. National mandates are meaningless for America's schools. The problem must be addressed one district and one school at a time. Why not let classroom teachers-- instead of bureaucrats and politicians--fashion a plan to improve learning in the classroom? Give more control to the local districts in building reading retention, math skills and graduation rates?"", ""Mr. President, the editorial goes on, but it ends with the following:"", ""The answer to fixing America's educational woes rests with individual school boards and passionate educators. The bureaucrats must reduce the red tape and mandates that are strangling our schools. Give those who know best the time, talent and incentives to finally fix public education."", ""I agree with the Southeast Missourian. The answer to improving public education does not lie within the halls of Congress or in the granite buildings of the downtown Washington education establishment. As the editorial stated, we are ``far removed from the classroom.''"", ""In my opinion, the real solutions--the laboratories--are local schools when they are given the opportunity to excel and not play the ``Mother, May I?'' game with Washington."", ""Here in Congress we must not be afraid to propose change. But in proposing change we must go directly to those who can provide some answers--the teachers, principals, school administrators, school board members, and parents."", ""For the past couple of years, I have done just that and have developed in conjunction with them the ``Direct Check for Education Act."", ""Quite simply, the purpose of this bill is to consolidate six, primarily competitive grant programs of the Department of Education's programs. The programs are Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program. The bill then proposes to return the federal funding by issuing a ``Direct Check'' to the local school district based on the number of students in each district. The result would be a resource of flexible funding that would allow individual schools and parents to determine how best to use the funds, including the hiring of new teachers, additional classrooms, new textbooks, expanded technology initiatives, drug and alcohol prevention programs, etc. The list goes on and on."", ""My ``Direct Check'' proposal is not the ``save-all'' answer. But the ``Direct Check'' will reduce the costly and time-consuming paperwork process that local school districts endure in obtaining federal grants and funding. It will treat children and schools the same by awarding funding to schools based upon the students served instead of rewarding some and penalizing others. My ``Direct Check for Education'' is a first step in simplifying and going ``back to the basics'' of education."", ""Mr. President, there will be those in the Washington education establishment who will oppose this bill. Instead of finding ways to empower those at the local level the opposition will argue that we need even more federal programs, more bureaucracy, more micro management of the classroom."", ""I believe the bottom line is this: Education, while a national priority, is a local responsibility. We must empower parents, teachers, school administrators, school boards, etc. because education decisions can best be made by people at the local schools who know the names and the challenges facing the students in those schools."", ""Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold and let local school districts do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement."", ""We have burdened it with excessive regulations and red tape. We have once again established a system where supposedly the ``olympians'' on the Hill know what is best for the ``peasants'' in the valley."", ""I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Education is and must be a national priority. But the good intentions that we have had in this body have led to the creation of more than 760 Federal education programs. Has that made education better? I don't think so. We added three more last year. And now we gather that the President is going to come up with a grand new Federal scheme. How many people really believe that the 764th Federal education program is going to assure that our kids can read? Is it going to assure that we get our high school students out of the 19th place out of 21 in terms of mathematics? I don't believe so."", ""Our system is not working. If you want to know how well it is working, go back home. Ask the teachers in your local school district. Ask the principals in your local school district. Ask the parents at home. Ask the school board members. If you do that, I believe you will hear what I have heard, time and time again: They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government. They are tired of spending the time to fill out the forms for the grants, to comply and jump through the hoops that the Federal Government sets out for them, to write the reports and fill out the evaluation forms that are needed, only to have a competitive grant program run out at the end of 3 years. They are tired of playing ``Mother, May I?'' with the Federal Government."", ""We have an opportunity to do something that I think is very significant. Instead of going down the road that is going to be proposed of another new Federal program, we ought to take the remedies out of the hands of the Federal Government. National mandates are meaningless for American schools. The problems must be addressed one school district, one school, at a time. Why not let classroom teachers, the parents, the administrators--instead of bureaucrats and politicians--make the decisions on how to improve the education in their school districts? Give more control back to local districts and let them build reading retention, math skills, and improve graduation rates."", ""Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill we call the direct check for education bill. It takes six of the major Federal competitive grant programs--Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Education Technology, Innovative Education Program Strategies, the Fund for the Improvement of Education, and the President's 100,000 teachers program--and puts them into a pool. That pool is to be divided on the basis of the students--K through 12--on average daily attendance. And it is to be returned to those local school districts on the basis of the number of students they have. Very simple. Cut the Federal red tape. Let them use those education dollars."", ""It starts off with a $3.5-million authorization, because we want to allow schools that already have competitive grants of multiyear tenure to complete those grants. At the end it will rise to $5 billion. It should come out to about $100 per student in every school--and turn the job back to the local schools, the parents, the teachers, the school board members, the administrators."", ""There are those who oppose this approach. They argue that we need even more Federal control. But as I said at the beginning, while it is a national priority, education must be returned to the local school districts as a local responsibility, to empower the people who know the names of the kids, their problems, their challenges, and their opportunities, to make the decision."", ""Let's keep things simple. Let's take off the Federal stranglehold. Let's let local schools do their jobs. Let's educate our children for a lifetime of achievement. Ask your teachers, your principals, your superintendents, your school board members; and then I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation that Senator Ashcroft and I are introducing today."", ""Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and common questions about the direct check for education bill be printed in the Record.""]",2015-03-14 01:26:50.650168,2015-03-14 01:26:50.650168,Senate,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,1999-01-19,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1999-01-19/html/CREC-1999-01-19-pt1-PgS345-2.htm,8,158,145,S345-S470,B000611,mr. bond

As part of a standard education, music was used to teach math and deemed equally important to forming a balanced individual. As a former educator, I know that an important component to youth development and a key solution to youth violence is access to art and music education in our schools. College Board studies have shown that students who play an instrument score significantly higher on their Scholastic Aptitude Tests than those who do not. High risk elementary students who participated in an arts program for one year gained eight percentile points on standardized language arts tests. Those who have exposure to music and art are less likely to have discipline problems. If we are serious about improving student achievement and curtailing youth violence in our schools, we must find adequate funding to bring music and art education to our children."", ""Missouri's fifth district has taken major steps toward integrating arts education into the daily routine in schools. Magnet schools such as the Paseo Academy of Visual and Performing Arts and the Kansas City Middle School of the Arts teach children more than just reading, writing, and arithmetic.

The Kansas City Symphony established an orchestral residency at the Paseo Academy to provide professional mentors to aspiring musicians. The results of programs like this are astounding.

In the last debate I believe I heard the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro] suggest that we need to challenge the House to spend more money on training. This amendment meets that challenge, and may be more timely even because of that challenge, that we spend more of our money on training."", ""I think increasing spending in OSHA, as opposed to increasing spending in vocational and adult education, really just does not make sense to me, so this amendment is to transfer that increase. OSHA would be frozen. OSHA is being studied. There are field hearings on OSHA. There is nobody who is a member of this body who does not believe that OSHA needs to be significantly restructured in the way it does its job."", ""At the same time, vocational and adult education have been incredibly successful programs that are actually funded below the 1997 levels.

The best place to have workers prepare to be safe workers is not on the job, but before they get on the job, and vocational education has a track record of doing that effectively."", ""This transfer would make sense from the training point of view. It freezes OSHA at the 1997 level. With this transfer we actually fund vocational education and adult education above the 1997 level. I urge its passage. I think when we look at the number of people that work in OSHA, the average business that is affected by OSHA really can anticipate a visit maybe as infrequently as once every 10 years. That does not ensure workplace safety."", ""Well-trained workers do ensure workplace safety. Vocational education money and adult education money get people to work who have not been to work before. They increase the skills of those people who have not been to work before."", ""On the other hand, OSHA often encourages people not to create jobs, and there are examples probably in every district represented in this House where people keep their employee numbers below 50 just so they will not have to deal with OSHA. When the OSHA inspector comes, it depends on which part of the OSHA code that inspector is familiar with on how the inspection goes that day. Training, Mr. Chairman, is the key to the workplace.

93,MO,John,Ashcroft,R,"[""Mr. President, on two separate occasions this year I have made statements about the importance of education to our Nation and to this Congress. I've talked about what our parents want for their children, how to provide a good education, and how many of our current federal policies have failed to achieve what we want for our children."", ""Today, as the Senator from Arkansas introduces his ``Dollars to the Classroom Act,'' which incorporates ingredients for educational success into our federal policy, I want to join in cosponsoring his bill as it will empower states and local school districts to spend federal resources in the best way they see fit. I also want to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of education."", ""A Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall found that 88% of those surveyed think that improving the quality of public school education is ``very important.'' Now, I am not one to put a lot of emphasis on polls, but I think that this poll indicates what we already know: that making sure kids get a world-class education is a real priority for our nation. Moms and dads want their children to be in settings where they will be challenged to reach high levels of academic achievement, taught by qualified and caring teachers, and provided a safe learning environment."", ""Obviously, parents want to be sure that schools are using the ingredients of success in education: parental involvement, local control, an emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance. It is interesting to note that a recent report of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives."", ""Unfortunately, we are continuing to find that many of our current federal education programs, while well-intended, simply do not contain the ingredients of a successful education. Rather than promoting parental involvement, local control, and dollars going to the classroom, many federal programs promote a ``Washington-knows-best'' policy, in which federal bureaucrats decide exactly what education programs should be developed and exactly how every dollar should be spent. Not only are states, schools, teachers, and parents left without much say in how to educate their children, but they are also drained of time and energy complying with all the federal mandates handed down to them."", ""Our current federal education laws bog states down in mountains of paperwork every year. Even though the U.S. Department of Education recently attempted to reduce paperwork burdens, the Department still requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork per year--or the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full-time. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications states must fill out to receive federal education funds each year."", ""While the Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the smallest federal agencies with 4,637 people, state education agencies have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs (full-time equivalents) with federal dollars to administer the myriad federal programs. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally funded employees of state education agencies administering federal education programs as there are U.S. Department of Education employees."", ""It is no wonder that up to 35% of our federal education dollar gets eaten up by bureaucratic and administrative costs. And we should remember this in the context of the fact that only about 7% of all education funding comes from the federal government. As we can see, this small amount of the entire education pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts must spend to administer education programs."", ""I have also spoken in the past about the Ohio study finding that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of its total education funding. And I've also noted that in Florida it takes six times as many state employees to administer federal funds as it does to administer state dollars."", ""Clearly, federal rules and regulations eat up precious dollars and teacher time. We must find a way to change this."", ""I have also highlighted that the problem that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars paid by their parents for education because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. Local schools must come to Washington and plead their case to get back the money the parents of their communities sent to the federal treasury. Who suffers the most from this system? Smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer to get their fair share of the federal dollar."", ""It is also interesting to note that, according to the Department of Education's own estimates, it takes 216 steps and 20 weeks to complete the review process for a federal discretionary education grant. The Department boasts that this is actually a streamlined process, since it used to take 26 weeks and took 487 steps from start to finish!"", ""I have talked about a third problem with many current federal education programs: dollars are earmarked for one and only one purpose, to the exclusion of all other uses. And many times, the distant Washington bureaucrats are designating funds for something that a school district doesn't even need at the time."", ""I like to use an analogy to explain this problem. If you feel a headache coming on, would you rather be treated by a doctor one mile away from where you live, or a thousand miles away? And if you have to use the doctor a thousand miles away, how good is he or she going to be at prescribing what you need for your headache? It sure would be nicer to see someone close by who could take a look at you in person and make a proper diagnosis."", ""And what if, when you tell the doctor a thousand miles away that you have a headache, she says to you, ``Oh, that's too bad. But today we're running a special on crutches. We are prescribing crutches for people like you all over the country, because we've heard that you may need them.'' You say, ``That's fine, but how is a crutch going to help my headache? Can't I get the money to buy some aspirin?'' And the doctor says, ``Sorry, but you can only use this money for crutches, not for aspirin, or anything else.''"", ""This is exactly what happens with so many of these categorical programs mandated from the federal level. Your local school district has determined that it needs funding for one thing, but the federal government will only release it for another. As a result, schools don't have the flexibility to use their funding for what they know they need to provide the best education possible for their students."", ""For all the federal programs and dollars committed to education, are we seeing success? I'm afraid not."", ""I have heard of a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which noted that even though the United States dedicates one of the largest shares of gross domestic product to education, it has fallen behind other economic powers in high school graduation rates. Only 72 percent of 18-year-old Americans graduated in 1996, trailing all other developed countries."", ""Our Congressional Research Service has explained why current federal aid programs may not lead to educational improvement. They note that these programs have generally been focused on specific student population groups with special needs, priority subject areas, or specific educational concepts or techniques. CRS reports:"", ""While such ``categorical'' program structures assure that aid is directed to the priority population or purpose, they may not always be effective--instruction may become fragmented and poorly coordinated; the proliferation of programs may be duplicative; each federally assisted program may affect only a marginal portion of each pupil's instructional time that is poorly coordinated with the remainder of her or his instruction; regulations intended to target aid on particular areas of need may unintentionally limit local ability to engage in comprehensive reforms; or the partial segregation of special needs students, while it helps to guarantee that funds can be clearly associated with each program's intended beneficiaries, may also reinforce tendencies toward tracking pupils by achievement level, and unintentionally contribute to a perpetuation of lower expectations for their performance."", ""I think the Congressional Research Service makes some valid observations about why our current federal education policy is not generally boosting student achievement and making our children competitive with other nations. CRS says that current federal policy hinders an important element of educational success: local control."", ""Based upon what we know about the state of our current federal education policy, we must explore how to direct our resources in ways that will stimulate academic success and high achievement. States, school districts, school boards, teachers, and of course, parents, are asking for local control and flexibility to spend federal education dollars in ways they know will work. They know how to incorporate the ingredients of success into the education of their children."", ""Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will give states and local schools the flexibility that they desperately need. His legislation takes nearly $3.5 billion from a number of federal education programs, directs the money to the states based upon student population, and requires that at least 95% of it is spent in our children's classrooms. Local school districts may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement."", ""Under the ``Dollars to Classroom Act,'' parents, teachers, school boards and administrators will have the freedom to use federal dollars for what they need: whether it be to hire more teachers, raise teacher salaries, strengthen reading programs, buy new computers, or provide more one-on-one tutoring."", ""The bill ensures that federal bureaucracy will be held at bay by forbidding the Secretary of Education from issuing any regulations regarding the type of classroom activities or services that school districts may choose to provide with the federal dollars. Finally, the ``Dollars to Classroom Act'' calls for ways to streamline regulations and eliminate bureaucracy within major federal education laws."", ""Mr. President, we need to ensure that more federal education money is sent to the classroom, and that states, schools, and parents have more flexibility in using those funds in the way that will best help students achieve their fullest potential. We must find ways to encourage states and local schools to be innovative and creative in finding the most successful ways to challenge our students to the highest levels and achievement. Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will help accomplish these goals, and that is why I am pleased to co-sponsor his legislation."", ""During the coming months, Congress should continue to evaluate our current federal elementary and secondary education programs and make the necessary changes to incorporate the ingredients we know have proven successful in providing the best education possible for our children. We cannot afford to maintain the status quo if it is not working. We owe it to our next generation to provide them what they need to be successful in the 21st Century.

HR 5203, however, does not actually benefit the majority of students and families."", ""Education savings accounts were established in 1997 as a tool for families to save money over a period of years for their children's higher education. Congress recognized the growing cost of college and the increasing difficulty families face trying to pay for college, and created these accounts to encourage early savings. Last year's tax cut legislation increased the contribution limit for education savings accounts from $500 to $2,000 and expanded the definition of qualified education expenses that can be paid from an education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary school expenses for public, private, or religious schools."", ""While I support making education more affordable, HR 5203 will allow parents to use these statutorily created education savings accounts--tax free--for almost ANY aspect they consider relevant to their child's education, at any school from kindergarten through college."", ""If parents feel they need a new sport utility vehicle to drive their kids to school; That is OK."", ""If they need a new microwave oven to prepare breakfast for their kids before school; That is OK."", ""If I want to use these funds, tax free, to pay my older son Johnny to tutor my younger son Matthew on the ABCs; That is OK."", ""Mr. Speaker, these examples seem silly for good reason; this bill does nothing to help families or to teach children.

Recently, Mr. Lukens announced his retirement after 31 years of distinguished service in Missouri's Public Schools."", ""Mr. Lukens was born on June 23, 1947, to Harry and Ella Lukens in St. Louis, Missouri. Upon graduation from high school he joined the U.S. Navy and served as an air traffic controller from 1967 until 1972. After his honorable discharge, Mr. Lukens pursued a degree in education from Southeast Missouri State University, which is also where he met his future wife, Ellen. Upon graduation from the Southeast Missouri State, he commenced what would be a long and laudable career in education."", ""Mr. Lukens has dedicated his life to public education over the past 31 years. He embarked on his teaching career in the Cape Girardeau, Missouri, public school system, where he served as a language arts teacher for 21 years. Throughout his time in the Cape Girardeau Public Schools, he served in several capacities for many extracurricular activities, including sponsor of the Red Dagger Club and set director for theatric productions. In order to play an active role in the lives of even more students, Mr. Lukens pursued a position in school administration."", ""In 1996, Mr. Lukens accepted a position as Assistant Principal at R.O. Hawkins Junior High School and has served the school in this capacity for the past ten years. During his tenure, Mr. Lukens has overseen several massive construction projects to the school, a growing student population, and the everyday challenges associated with the instruction of adolescents. As the faces change every year in the halls of R.O. Hawkins Junior High, Mr. Lukens' dedication to education and cultivating the leaders of tomorrow remains a constant. To the students of R.O. Hawkins Junior High, Mr. Lukens is more than just a school administrator, he is a friend and mentor."", ""Although Mr. Lukens has led an exemplary career in education, it would not have been possible without the love and support of his family. Mr. Lukens' wonderful wife, Ellen, and two loving children, Jennie and Laura, undoubtedly enhanced his ability to change the lives of area youth. As I commend Mr. Lukens, I also recognize the efforts of his family to further his career. I once again congratulate Mr. Lukens on a successful career in education and wish him well in all his future endeavors.""]",2015-03-14 01:26:55.258445,2015-03-14 01:26:55.258445,Extensions,TRIBUTE TO STEVE LUKENS,2006-04-26,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-04-26/html/CREC-2006-04-26-pt1-PgE605-2.htm,47,0,152,E605,E000172,mrs. emerson
100,MO,Sam,Graves,R,"[""Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of Fort Osage as a landmark identified and later developed by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the voyage of the Corps of Discovery."", ""In June of 1804, the Corps of Discovery passed a high bluff on the Missouri River--which would later become Fort Osage in Jackson County, Missouri. Only four years later, Clark returned to initiate construction on a Fort and trading-house under the direction of the War Department. Clark noted ``The River could be completely defended'' and he deemed the ``situation elegant.''"", ""Fort Osage (or Fort Clark as it was originally named) played an important role in the exploration and development of the West. Goods were traded with the Osage, Ayauway and Kansas tribes at this site for years to come. Fort Osage proved to be the single most profitable trading post of its kind in the United States and the territories. We are indebted to the legacy of the Fort and the people who lived, worked and defended the Fort. Their courage had a profound effect on the evolution of our nation."", ""As part of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration, Jackson County Parks and Recreation is proposing an innovative education center. The education center would showcase artifacts and exhibit the significance of the Missouri River. I believe this education center is a wonderful addition to the commemoration and will help visitors understand the significance of Fort Osage. It is the only site along the trail where Clark returned to develop a facility that fulfilled the goals of President Thomas Jefferson's dream of commerce and development with the west. The significance of Fort Osage is not limited to Lewis and Clark. Both the Yellowstone Expedition and the Long Expedition visited the Fort in 1819. The Long Expedition brought the first steamboat, Western Engineer. Only years later, William Becknell arrived at Fort Osage, using the site as mile marker ``0'' for the Santa Fe trail, again distinguishing the importance of the Fort in relation to commerce in the west."", ""Due to the area's historical significance, the Fort Osage Education Center was proposed as part of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration. The Education Center was recently recognized by the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission as the priority project in Missouri and I am honored to have this historical site in my district. I look forward to the events surrounding the bicentennial commemoration at Fort Osage and in other areas of the 6th District of Missouri. I join the Missouri Bicentennial Commission, the Missouri Department of Conservation and the United States Geological Survey in full support of the proposed Fort Osage Education Center.""]",2015-03-14 01:26:55.380561,2015-03-14 01:26:55.380561,Extensions,FORT OSAGE,2001-05-08,http://origin.www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2001-05-08/html/CREC-2001-05-08-pt1-PgE751-5.htm,62,0,147,E751-E752,G000546,mr. graves
